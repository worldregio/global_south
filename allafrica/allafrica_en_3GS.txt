As the global community races to close the staggering $4.2 trillion financing gap needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) emerges as a crucial juncture.

Scheduled for June 30 to July 3, 2025, in Seville, Spain, this conference is not merely another gathering of world leaders and finance ministers. It represents a pivotal opportunity to reshape the global financial architecture and address critical issues such as climate financing, tax governance, and debt relief.

Yet, one vital partner in this process--philanthropy--remains largely underutilized. As governments navigate competing priorities and the private sector remains hesitant to fully commit to the development agenda, philanthropic funders have a unique role to play in ensuring that FfD4 delivers on its promise of equitable and sustainable outcomes.

Our recent report titled "Setting the Global Agenda for Tax, Debt, and International Aid through 2035," underscores this urgency. The report calls on funders to engage actively in the FfD4 process and outlines key ways they can contribute to its success.

One vital contribution is widening stakeholder participation. Philanthropic funders can ensure that Global South civil society organizations (CSOs) have a seat at the table by providing financial support for their participation. The FfD4's inclusive intergovernmental format, managed by the United Nations, is unique in offering Global South countries an equal footing, but to influence the eventual outcomes you need to be in the negotiating rooms.

Earlier this month, government representatives began narrowing down their wishlist in discussions in New York, but it is expensive to send delegations. Funders can facilitate the engagement of Global South governments in negotiations by financially supporting their involvement. This helps amplify their voices and ensures that systemic reforms reflect their realities and needs.

Additionally, philanthropy can bridge underfunded areas by supporting innovative research and advocacy efforts, particularly in tax reform and debt governance. For example, among the proposals up for debate is creation of a tax on the super wealthy backed by a global asset registry, a concept built out with philanthropic support. Filling these thematic gaps is essential to assuring that FfD4 sets an ambitious agenda for the decade to come.

Another critical action is for funders to make public commitments aligning their strategies with the FfD4 agenda backed by new investments, so inspiring others and encouraging donor accountability. The real test of FfD4's impact, however, will come in the follow-up phase. Continued funding from philanthropic actors will be critical to ensuring the promises made at the conference are translated into concrete actions.

At the heart of the FfD4 agenda are issues that demand urgent and transformative action. The global debt crisis, for example, has left many developing nations in a financial stranglehold, threatening their economic stability and ability to invest in health, education, and infrastructure. A UN-mandated legal framework for debt resolution and targeted relief measures could provide a lifeline, but these require sustained advocacy and pressure from all quarters, including philanthropic actors.

Similarly, taxation and illicit financial flows (IFFs) remain contentious issues. Developing countries lose an estimated $1 trillion annually to tax avoidance and evasion, undermining their ability to fund essential services. Philanthropy can support research and policy advocacy to ensure that Global South perspectives are at the forefront of these reforms.

Finally, the conference will revisit the role of private financing in closing the SDG funding gap. While leveraging private capital has shown mixed results, the philanthropic community can play a critical role in identifying and promoting alternative, effective solutions.

While philanthropy has often been a silent partner in the Financing for Development process, this is the moment to step forward and make a tangible and long-lasting impact. For funders, FfD4 is not just an event--it is a call to action. It is an opportunity to amplify the voices of the marginalized, push for systemic change, and hold governments and institutions accountable. The philanthropic community must seize this moment to drive reforms that prioritize equity, transparency, and sustainability.

The clock is ticking. The world is watching. And philanthropy must rise to the occasion.

HD 	The Climate Crisis As a Diplomatic Battlefield

The climate crisis, a defining challenge of the 21st century, is not just an environmental issue; it is increasingly a critical arena for international diplomacy. From intense negotiations at COP summits to the politics of energy transitions and resource control, climate change is shaping the geopolitical landscape.

This dynamic reflects deep divides between developed and developing nations on climate justice and raises critical questions about whether global diplomacy can bridge these tensions to achieve meaningful change.

TD 
	

Climate Change

Climate change is a global problem requiring collective action, but the geopolitical nature of climate negotiations often complicates this goal. At international forums such as the Conference of the Parties (COP), countries are expected to come together to craft solutions to limit global temperature rises. However, these forums frequently highlight stark disparities in perspectives, priorities and responsibilities.

Developed nations, historically responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions, often push for ambitious global targets. Yet, they are also accused of failing to deliver on their promises of financial and technological support for developing nations.

Developing countries, on the other hand, prioritize adaptation and financial aid, arguing that their limited historical contributions to emissions and ongoing developmental needs make equity and fairness non-negotiable.

This tension has been a recurring theme, exemplified by the debates around loss and damage funding, the establishment of which marked a significant step at COP27 in Egypt. While the agreement was a victory for climate justice advocates, questions remain over its operationalization and whether it can meaningfully address the complex needs of vulnerable countries.

The Politics of Energy Transitions

The transition to renewable energy lies at the heart of climate action, but it also underpins new forms of geopolitical rivalry. The shift from fossil fuels to renewables disrupts existing power dynamics in the global energy market, creating opportunities and challenges.

Developed nations, equipped with technological advancements and financial resources, are positioning themselves as leaders in renewable energy. The European Union, for instance, has spearheaded green initiatives such as the European Green Deal, while the United States has invested heavily in clean energy infrastructure through the Inflation Reduction Act.

These countries frame their actions as models for others to follow, yet their own energy security priorities sometimes overshadow global equity concerns.

For resource-rich developing nations, the politics of energy transitions are more nuanced. Countries like Nigeria and Angola, whose economies rely heavily on fossil fuel exports, face the dual challenge of transitioning to renewables while maintaining economic stability.

Moreover, resource control over critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements, essential for renewable energy technologies, has turned countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo into focal points of international competition.

The scramble for these resources raises concerns over whether the renewable energy revolution will perpetuate the same extractive patterns that have historically marginalized the Global South.

Climate Justice

The concept of climate justice underscores the inequities between developed and developing nations in their capacity to combat and adapt to climate change. Developed nations, having industrialized on the back of carbon-intensive activities, are now urging the Global South to follow a low-carbon development path. However, this demand often neglects the realities faced by many developing nations.

Countries in the Global South are disproportionately affected by climate impacts despite contributing the least to global emissions. From rising sea levels in the Pacific Islands to desertification in the Sahel, vulnerable nations bear the brunt of a crisis they did not create. Calls for climate finance, particularly grants rather than loans, have been central to their demands, as they seek support for adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage recovery.

Yet, the failure of developed nations to fulfill their long-standing pledge of $100 billion annually in climate finance exacerbates mistrust. At COP28 and beyond, developing nations are likely to continue pressing for stronger commitments and mechanisms to ensure accountability. The tension lies not just in the amount of financing but also in its accessibility, with many vulnerable nations criticizing complex processes that delay much-needed support.

Diplomacy at COP

The annual COP summits are microcosms of the broader diplomatic battle over climate change. Since the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015, these summits have sought to galvanize global action to limit temperature increases to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. However, the implementation of these commitments remains uneven and the ambition gap persists.

The Paris Agreement's hallmark principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" (CBDR-RC) captures the equity challenge at the heart of climate diplomacy. It acknowledges that while all nations must act on climate change, their responsibilities differ based on historical emissions and capacities.

Yet, operationalizing this principle often leads to disagreements. Developed nations emphasize collective action and insist that emerging economies like China and India ramp up their mitigation efforts. Conversely, developing nations argue that they should not bear the same burden as historically high emitters.

The incremental nature of COP negotiations also invites criticism. Critics argue that the focus on long-term goals often overshadows the urgency of immediate action, and the influence of powerful fossil fuel lobbyists at these summits further complicates progress. Despite these challenges, COP summits remain a vital platform for fostering dialogue, building coalitions, and driving incremental but meaningful change.

Beyond COP

The geopolitics of climate change extend far beyond COP negotiations. Climate action has become a strategic lever in foreign policy, with countries using it to forge alliances, exert influence and secure economic advantages.

For instance, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has incorporated green development as a key pillar, with Beijing promoting renewable energy projects across the Global South. However, critics question whether these projects align with sustainability goals or primarily serve China's geopolitical interests.

Similarly, the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which imposes tariffs on carbon-intensive imports, is seen by some as a protectionist measure that could disadvantage developing countries.

The United States has also positioned itself as a climate leader under the Biden administration, rejoining the Paris Agreement and committing to ambitious domestic targets. However, its international credibility on climate action remains fragile, given its historical withdrawal from agreements and ongoing domestic political divisions.

Can Global Diplomacy Bridge the Divide?

The ability of global diplomacy to overcome tensions and achieve meaningful change hinges on several factors. First, trust-building measures, such as fulfilling climate finance commitments and establishing transparent mechanisms for loss and damage funding, are essential. Second, fostering inclusive decision-making that amplifies the voices of vulnerable nations can help bridge the North-South divide.

Innovative approaches, such as the Bridgetown Initiative proposed by Barbados, offer a potential roadmap. This initiative advocates for reforming the global financial system to better address climate vulnerabilities, emphasizing grants, concessional financing and debt relief for climate-affected countries. Such proposals highlight the need for structural changes that go beyond the traditional frameworks of climate diplomacy.

Finally, the rise of climate activism and youth movements worldwide has injected new urgency and accountability into the process. From Greta Thunberg's Fridays for Future to indigenous movements defending natural resources, these voices challenge governments to act with greater ambition and equity.

Conclusion

The climate crisis is undeniably a diplomatic battlefield, reflecting deep-seated inequities and competing priorities. While international forums like COP provide a platform for negotiation, the path to meaningful change requires addressing the underlying tensions between developed and developing nations. Climate justice, equitable energy transitions, and innovative financial mechanisms must take center stage if global diplomacy is to succeed.

The stakes could not be higher. As the impacts of climate change accelerate, the world faces a narrowing window of opportunity to act decisively. Only through genuine collaboration, rooted in fairness and shared responsibility, can humanity rise to the challenge and transform the climate crisis from a battlefield into a catalyst for global solidarity.

HD 	COP29 Falls Short On Finance

COP29, the latest annual climate summit, had one job: to strike a deal to provide the money needed to respond to climate change. It failed.

This was the first climate summit dedicated to finance. Global south countries estimate they need a combined US$1.3 trillion a year to transition to low-carbon economies and adapt to the impacts of climate change. But the last-minute offer made by global north states was for only US$300 billion a year.

TD 
	

The agreement leaves vague how much of the promised target, to be met by 2035, will be in the form of direct grants, as opposed to other means such as loans, and how much will come directly from states. As for the US$1 trillion annual funding gap, covering it remains an aspiration, with all potential sources encouraged to step up their efforts. The hope seems to be that the private sector will invest where it hasn't already, and that innovations such as new levies and taxes will be explored, which many powerful states and industry lobbyists are sure to resist.

Some global north states are talking up the deal, pointing out that it triples the previous target of US$100 billion a year, promised at COP15 in 2009 and officially reached in 2022, although how much was provided in reality remains a matter of debate. Some say this deal is all they can afford, given economic and political constraints.

But global north states hardly engaged constructively. They delayed making an offer for so long that the day before talks were due to end, the draft text of the agreement contained no numbers. Then they made a lowball offer of US$250 billion a year.

Many representatives from global south states took this as an insult. Talks threatened to collapse without an agreement. Amid scenes of chaos and confusion, the summit's president, Mukhtar Babayev of Azerbaijan, was accused of weakness and lack of leadership. By the time global north states offered US$300 billion, negotiations had gone past the deadline, and many saw this as a take-it-or-leave it offer.

The negotiating style of global north states spoke of a fundamental inequality in climate change. Global north countries have historically contributed the bulk of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions due to their industrialisation. But it's global south countries that are most affected by climate change impacts such as extreme weather and rising sea levels. What's more, they're being asked to take a different development path to fossil fuel-powered industrialisation - but without adequate financial support to do so.

These evident injustices led some states, angered by Babayev bringing talks to an abrupt end, to believe that no deal would have been better than what was agreed. For others, waiting another year for COP30 would have been a luxury they couldn't afford, given the ever-increasing impacts of climate change.

Financing on the agenda

Far from being settled, the conversation around climate financing should be regarded as only just having begun. The figures involved - whether it's US$300 billion or US$1.3 trillion a year - seem huge, but in global terms they're tiny. The US$1.3 trillion needed is less than one per cent of global GDP, which stands at around US$110 trillion. It's a little more than the amount invested in fossil fuels this year, and far less than annual global military spending, which has risen for nine years running and now stands at around US$2.3 trillion a year.

If the money isn't forthcoming, the sums needed will be eclipsed by the costs of cleaning up the disasters caused by climate change, and dealing with rising insecurity, conflict and economic disruption. For example, devastating floods in Valencia, Spain, in October caused at least 217 deaths and economic losses of around US$10.6 billion. Research suggests that each degree of warming would slash the world's GDP by 12 per cent. Investing in a transition that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and enables communities to adapt isn't just the right thing to do - it's also the economically prudent option.

The same problems arose at another recent summit on a related issue - COP16 of the Biodiversity Convention, hosted by Colombia in October. This broke up with no agreement on how to meet the funding commitments agreed at its previous meeting. The international community, having forged agreements to address climate change and protect the environment, is stuck when it comes to finding the funding to realise them.

What's largely missing is discussion of how wealth might be better shared for the benefit of humanity. Over the past decade, as the world has grown hotter, inequality has soared, with the world's richest one per cent adding a further US$42 trillion to their fortunes - less than needed to adequately respond to climate change. The G20's recent meeting said little on climate change, but leaders at least agreed that ultra-wealthy people should be properly taxed. The battle should now be on to ensure this happens - and that revenues are used to tackle climate change.

When it comes to corporations, few are richer than the fossil fuel industry. But the 'polluter pays' principle - that those who cause environmental damage pay to clean it up - seems missing from climate negotiations. The fossil fuel industry is the single biggest contributor to climate change, responsible for over 75 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. It's grown incredibly rich thanks to its destructive trade.

Over the past five decades, the oil and gas sector has made profits averaging US$2.8 billion a day. Only a small fraction of those revenues have been invested in alternatives, and oil and gas companies plan to extract more: since COP28, around US$250 billion has been committed to developing new oil and gas fields. The industry's wealth should make it a natural target for paying to fix the mess it's made. A proposed levy on extractions could raise US$900 billion by 2030.

Progress is needed, and fast. COP30 now has the huge task of compensating for the failings of COP29. Pressure must be kept up for adequate financing combined with concerted action to cut emissions. Next year, states are due to present their updated plans to cut emissions and adapt to climate change. Civil society will push for these to show the ambition needed - and for money to be mobilised at the scale required.

HD 	'Continuously Opposed' - Global South Vexed At What Went Unsaid At COP29

In Baku, developed countries managed to prevent comprehensive discussions of unilateral trade measures. They can only delay for so long.

For the first time at a climate conference, the Global South collectively warned about the effects of unilateral trade measures. In consultations with the Azerbaijani presidency at COP29, the G77+China group expressed "deep concern" that some developed countries' one-sided protectionist policies will undermine their economies.

TD 
	

In a statement seen by African Arguments, the bloc of 134 developing countries warned: "The rise in unilateral policies and actions in the political, economic and trade domains is a major threat to multilateralism and should be stopped...The use of a hard stick hitting on our heads and hands is not a solution to climate change response."

A major focus of the Global South's consternation is the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Introduced in 2023, the regulation imposes a carbon tax on certain imports such as aluminium, steel, fertilisers and cement. Other countries such as the UK and Australia are considering imposing their own versions.

The intention of these policies is to put a price on carbon and thus incentivise producers to adopt lower emitting practices. However, critics argue that these unilaterally imposed measures unfairly impact countries in the Global South that lack the resources to transition to clean energy. One study suggests that CBAM could reduce Africa's GDP by $25 billion, which is about three times the amount of development aid the EU provides to the continent.

"Many African countries are still reliant on carbon-intensive industries as they transition to greener economies," Ali Mohamed, Chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), told African Arguments. "We feel that imposing CBAM without adequate support for these transitions can harm their economies and reduce the resources they have for adaptation and resilience."

The negotiator explained that the Global South pushed for trade measures to be discussed at COP29 in Baku. "We want to ensure that climate policies do not become inadvertent economic penalties for vulnerable nations," he said.

However, he says, their calls were "continuously opposed" by developed countries.

"Not this forum"

At COP28 in Dubai last year, the BASIC Group - comprising Brazil, South Africa, China, and India - argued that the impacts of unilateral trade measures should be a separate agenda item. Developed countries, and the EU in particular, disagreed. As a result, such discussions were integrated into other negotiation tracks such as response measures. The response measures track includes discussions on how countries' responses to climate change could have adverse impacts and how such impacts could be managed.

At COP29, the BASIC Group once again proposed a stand-alone agenda item on unilateral trade measures. The G77+China echoed these calls in their statement and called on parties "to refrain from playing the game of 'that forum, not this forum"'.

This was a reference to developed countries resisting discussions by arguing that the issue is inappropriate to the conference at hand. At climate talks, Global North negotiators have said issues such as CBAM are to do with trade. At forums like the World Trade Organisation, they have suggested that carbon border taxes are questions of climate policy.

For Mahendra Shunmoogam, Director of International Trade Policy for the Republic of South Africa, the distinction is nonsensical. "Things don't operate in silos," he says. "Climate change impacts trade and industrialisation and economic growth. Developed countries have been quite reluctant to recognise trade and other economic issues at COPs, but we can't have these discussions separately." Shunmoogam expressed similar concerns during COP29 negotiations as part of South Africa's delegation.

Some experts from the Global South believe that unilateral trade measures should be discussed at both trade and climate talks. The intergovernmental South Centre has elaborated on how measures like CBM violate WTO rules. Meanwhile, many have pointed out that the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), under which COPs operate, explicitly calls on parties to "promote a supportive and open international economic system". It warns that "measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade".

"Developed countries cannot make it go away"

Despite the efforts of the Global South, developed countries successfully rejected comprehensive discussions on unilateral trade measures at COP29. Instead, parties agreed to establish a five-year work plan as part of negotiations on response measures to "analyse, assess and report on the impacts of measures taken to combat climate change, including cross-border impacts".

As the concerns of the Global South grow, however, developed countries may find it increasingly difficult to defer discussions. At the Third South Summit in January 2024, the G77+China criticised "unilateral and discriminatory border adjustment mechanisms and taxes". After the G20 summit in Brazil, held at the same time as COP29, the Leaders' Declaration noted similar concerns. The clamour to address the issue is only likely to increase.

"The G77 has converged on the issue of unilateral trade measures," says Avantika Goswami, Programme Manager for Climate Change at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). "Developed countries most likely cannot make it go away, much as they will attempt to. The concerns of the developing world are real."

Many in the Global South feel it is a great injustice that their countries are suffering from both the Global North's historic actions in driving the climate crisis and from their purported solutions to it today. Many developing countries have high unemployment rates and are worried about ripple effects on their industry from measures like carbon border taxes. Regulations like CBAM were imposed without consultation with countries that may be significantly affected.

"Climate change began with developed countries industrialising and causing damage," says Shunmoogam . "Now they are taking unilateral action like CBAM that perpetuates inequalities...The reforms now must happen within the multilateral system."

Government considers South Africa's Group of Twenty (G20) Presidency as an opportunity for the continent to address longstanding inequities, and to champion transformative policies that would benefit its people and those of the Global South in general.

Addressing the 2nd Annual Cape Town Conversation, Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni said South Africa seeks to ensure that the voices of marginalised and developing nations are not only heard but have a meaningful impact on the global stage.

TD 
	

"Countries in the Global South advocate for greater representation in international institutions such as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank. Forums such as the Conference of the Parties (COP) have witnessed the Global South shaping discussions on adaptation, mitigation, and the Loss and Damage Fund.

"It is in this context of it being part of the Global South that has shaped South Africa's vision for an inclusive global governance system that reflects South Africa's commitment to creating a world that prioritises fairness, sustainability, and cooperation," the Minister said.

Ntshavheni said championing reforms in international institutions, fostering African unity, and engaging in South-South cooperation is drawn from South Africa's foreign policy principles that are rooted in human rights, solidarity, and African unity.

"While the high-level deliverables and priorities of our G20 presidency resonate with the agenda of the Global South and Africa in particular; we have painstakingly ensured that our G20 presidency also mirrors and contributes to the realisation of our own national priorities and initiatives.

"It was indeed befitting that the African Union attained permanent membership of the G20 before our presidency and hosting of the summit on African soil - as this offers us an opportunity to collectively leverage the presence of our union in the G20 to champion a pan-African agenda.

"So, we advocate for an inclusive global governance system that prioritises equitable development, multilateral cooperation, and justice. South Africa has worked to reform international institutions and promote a more balanced world order," the Minister said.

South Africa has chosen the theme "Solidarity, Equality and Sustainability" for its G20 Presidency.

During its G20 Presidency, South Africa's priorities will include Inclusive economic growth, industrialisation, employment and inequality; food security and artificial intelligence and innovation for sustainable development.

South Africa seeks to elevate and accelerate the discussion around industrialisation, especially in Africa and other developing regions, focusing on special economic zones, green industries and technology, energy, food security, manufacturing, trade, logistics, and regional and global integration.

"This priority is strategically aligned with our own programme of action as articulated in the Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP) 2024-2029 on Inclusive Economic Growth and Job Creation.

"The realisation of this priority requires an alignment of all spheres of economic policy behind the goals of achieving high employment, decent work and inclusive economic growth through industrialisation and re-industrialisation, in a manner that focuses on youth employment, closes the gender-gap, reduces inequality and protects the environment," the Minister said.

During its Presidency, South Africa will propose the creation of a Task Force on Inclusive Economic Growth, Industrialisation, Employment and Inequality.

The Task Force will provide a platform to share ideas on economic policy frameworks best suited for the individual needs of countries, while at the same time ensuring international policy coordination.

The Minister said reports from prominent institutions such the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the World Food Programme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organisation paint a disturbing picture of the state of global hunger.

Reports released by these organisations in July 2024 place the number of people who faced hunger globally at 733 million.

"Africa continues to register negative food security trends, with 2024 being the fifth consecutive year of rising food insecurity on the continent. The number of Africans classified as 'food stressed' increased by 11 million to a record high of 225 million in 2024.

"Sub-Saharan Africa's continued reliance on subsistence farming and food imports makes the continent susceptible to a combination of global and local factors, such as extreme weather, economic shocks and conflict," Ntshavheni said.

During the G20 presidency, government will propose the establishment of a Task Force on Food Security.

"The task Force will look at food security and systems under regional and global pillars. Under the regional pillar, it is envisaged that the G20 could task the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to monitor, provide technical advice and encourage regional approaches to resilience in food systems, such as water, energy, infrastructure, trade, and climate change.

"Under the global pillar, the Task Force would embark on initiatives to address the drivers of food insecurity due to speculative activities, market concentration, and barriers related to food trading systems. Government of South Africa is currently considering a strategy to prevent Food Waste or Loss," the Minister said.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) features strongly in the 19th G20 Summit Leaders' Declaration (Brazil 2024).

"The Declaration emphasised that AI progress brings great opportunities for development within the framework of the digital economy and highlights the importance of establishing safeguards to uphold human rights, governance, the need for human supervision and appropriate regulation.

"This would ensure the alignment of technological development with human values. South Africa has noted that all these issues impact some of her priorities, especially those pertaining to Inclusive Economic Growth and Job Creation as AI will impact the world of work and the emergence of the digital economy," the Minister said.

Consequently, South Africa proposes that during its presidency of the G20, a Task Force on Artificial Intelligence be established to play a crucial role in aligning Africa's strategic priorities with the broader global agenda; ensuring that regional perspectives and needs are integrated into the international discourse on AI governance.

"We are strongly considering legacy projects of South Africa's G20 Presidency in the field of AI. During its presidency of the G20, South Africa also proposes a comprehensive review of the work of G20.

"The review will identify proposals to strengthen consensus building. At the G20 Brazil Leaders Summit, our President introduced the concept of "sufficient consensus" which was used during South Africa's CODESA negotiations," the Minister.

Furthermore, South Africa plans to continue the practice started by Brazil to include civil society that are not yet involved in the work of the G20 engagement groups.

A panel of African experts, negotiators, and activists give their verdict on the just-concluded climate talks in Baku.

Negotiators from Africa arrived in Baku for the COP29 climate talks two weeks ago with many hopes and a few clear demands. Foremost among them were that the new climate finance goal, known as the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), reflect the quantity and quality needed to address the Global South's deepening climate needs. Concretely, that meant developed countries providing at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035, of which $400-900 billion should take the form of public finance.

Two days late, exhausted and disappointed, the Global South left with a deal for just $300 billion to be raised through a "wide variety of sources", including development bank loans and private finance.

We asked a range of experts, negotiators, researchers, and activists for their verdict on what unfolded at COP29 and where it leaves Africa.

Iskander Erzini Vernoit: It didn't have to be this way

Baku was a betrayal of the world's vulnerable, of the Paris Agreement, and of common sense. The COP29 decision on the new finance goal represents a staggering lack of imagination and solidarity from the Global North.

$300 billion per year as a mobilisation goal for 2035 would be a laughable joke, except it is deadly serious. People will lose their lives as a result of the unwillingness to take tough political decisions at COP29. According to some analyses, developing countries easily require over $1 trillion per year in grant-equivalent terms to equitably address adaptation and loss and damage alone, not counting mitigation and energy transition. This $300 billion, like the $100 billion goal it replaces, will likely be largely non-concessional loans. Meanwhile, the North's subsidies for wars and fossil fuels amount to trillions per year.

This decision jeopardises the delivery of the aims of the Paris Agreement and UN Framework Convention, throwing national climate target-setting and delivery into deep uncertainty.

Amid rushed non-transparent processes, developed countries weaponised the fears of developing countries, who felt held hostage to the need to agree something before the Trump administration takes office. However, it didn't have to be this way. The short-sighted inability to challenge the Global North's un-ambition will likely be regretted, as will the COP Presidencies Troika's insistence on closing any deal regardless of its contents.

Nevertheless, the fight against catastrophic climate change must move forward, in greater solidarity with those threatened, to become more clear-eyed about the problems and solutions, more unified and more politically assertive than before.

*liiitag Iskander Erzini Vernoit is executive director of the Imal Initiative for Climate and Development, a think tank based in Rabat, Morocco.

Evans Njewa: Years of our good faith efforts were met with indifference

We leave this COP with both pride and pain. Pride in the resilience of our bloc, which we fought valiantly for the survival of the most vulnerable, but we are pained that our hopes for true climate justice have not been met

The LDC [Least Developed Countries] Group is outraged and deeply hurt by the outcome of COP29. Once again, the countries most responsible for the climate crisis have failed us. We leave Baku without an ambitious climate finance goal, without concrete plans to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, and without the comprehensive support desperately needed for adaptation and loss and damage.

This is not just a failure; it is a betrayal. Three years of relentless effort by the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) engaging in good faith, building solutions, and striving for justice have been casually dismissed. Powerful nations have shown no leadership, no ambition, and no regard for the lives of billions of people on the frontlines of the climate crisis. The just ended UN Climate Change Conference has proven what we feared: the voices of our 1.1 billion people have been ignored.

Despite exhaustive efforts to collaborate with key players, our pleas were met with indifference. This outright dismissal erodes the fragile trust that underpins these negotiations and mocks the spirit of global solidarity. This outcome is a travesty. It sacrifices the needs of the world's poorest and most vulnerable to protect the narrow interests of those who created this crisis. It prioritises profits and convenience over survival and justice.

*liiitag Evans Njewa is the Chair of the Least Developed Countries Group at UN Climate Change negotiations.

Fadhel Kaboub: The Global South will keep losing until it uses its geopolitical leverage

In the end, COP29 was not about climate. It was about an economic and geopolitical hierarchy that is not supposed to be disturbed. Why? Because real climate action would imply that climate finance is development finance. Real climate action means high quality transformative finance in the form of grants (not loans), cancellation of all climate-related debts (not rescheduling), and the sharing/transfer of life saving technologies to allow the Global South the manufacture and deploy the building blocks of climate resilience and adaptation - and that would unleash the full potential of the Global South as an economic powerhouse that is no longer locked at the bottom of the economic and geopolitical hierarchy. And that potential is perceived by the Global North as a threat to be managed and eliminated, not as an opportunity for development and climate action.

Unless the Global South recognises that we need to create a geopolitical leverage to pressure the historic polluters to act differently, we will continue to lose in every single multilateral space. We are the global majority. We can leverage the complementarity of our resources and capabilities to impose a new international economic order of justice, peace, and prosperity. If the historic polluters of the global minority do not get serious about its responsibilities, then we may have to start restricting access to our strategic minerals and our markets and start leveraging our collective economic weight to save the planet for all of humanity. No progress will be made in COP30 next year unless the Global South creates the geopolitical leverage it needs to level the playing field.

Wafa Misrar: Africa will not back down, and the world cannot afford to lose us

The NCQG negotiations were an opportunity to rebuild trust and demonstrate real commitment to tackling the climate crisis. Instead, developed countries have chosen to sideline their historical responsibility and prioritise inaction over justice again. By proposing $300 billion, they have sent a chilling message: the lives, homes, and futures of those most affected by climate change do not matter.

As Ambassador Ali Mohamed, Chair of the African Group of Negotiators, powerfully reminded us: When Africa loses, the world loses its minerals, biodiversity, and stability. The fate of this continent is tied to the stability of the entire planet, and ignoring Africa's call for fair and adequate climate finance risks global repercussions.

We, as African civil society organisations, stand united in calling on the Global North to recognise this undeniable truth. Take this inadequate proposal back, revisit your priorities, and return with a real commitment. No deal is better than a bad deal. The $100 billion promise of the Paris Agreement was a broken lifeline. Now, in 2024, offering $300 billion is a disrespect and an insult - not just to Africa, but to humanity.

This process cannot become a playground for profit-driven schemes like carbon markets or geoengineering. Climate finance must be public, equitable, and designed to address real loss and damage - not serve as a token gesture of charity. Africa will not back down. We will continue to hold the line until we see meaningful commitments that respect our rights, futures and dignity. The world cannot afford to lose Africa. And we cannot afford to lose ourselves again.

*liiitag Wafa Misrar is Campaign and Policy lead at Climate Action Network (CAN) Africa.

Ali Mohamed: We demanded clear targets and received none

Baku's decisions failed to rebalance adaptation and mitigation financing. While the New Collective Quantified Goal appears in writing, its delivery is left to the uncertain goodwill of public and private actors. No guarantees exist that climate finance will come as grants, not debt-loading loans for vulnerable nations. Africa demanded clear targets for mitigation, adaptation and loss & damage management. We received none. Our task now is to translate words into action. Substantial finance flows must reach those on the frontlines - families forced to flee rising seas, farmers facing failed crops, and communities recovering from cyclones.

On the Global Goal on Adaptation, the necessary guidance to experts on their work gives us a platform upon which we can develop global indicators with local relevance, including indicators for support towards different elements of the targets.

*liiitag Ali Mohamed is the Chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) at UN Climate Change negotiations.

Thato Gabaitse: A reminder that the system is designed to protect wealth, not justice

COP29 was billed as the "finance and gender COP", a turning point. Instead, it became yet another testament to the neo-colonial, oppressive nature of the global climate system. While year after year, we engage with evidence expert findings, demanding transformative outcomes, instead we get hollow commitments that fail to reflect the urgency or equity required to tackle the climate crisis.

Take the 10-year Lima Work Programme on Gender, which should represent inclusivity and protection of gender-diverse lives impacted by the climate crisis and yet remains toothless. The failure to include and amplify gender-diverse voices in meaningful ways perpetuates exclusion and fails to address the systemic inequalities that worsen climate impacts for the most vulnerable. It sidelines the lived realities, needs, and leadership of the frontline communities.

Equally disheartening is the lack of commitment to financing a just energy transition. Wealthy nations have once again dodged their obligations under the Paris Agreement, offering peanuts for a fair energy transition.

The system is failing us, a reminder that it is designed to protect power and wealth rather than ensure justice and equity. Developed nations continue to exploit the resources, labour, and goodwill of the Global South while avoiding their historical responsibility for the climate crisis. The promise of a "just transition" becomes an empty phrase as fossil fuel dependency deepens to meet debt-servicing obligations.

While COP29 was another disappointment, we must fuel the collective momentum we built, to explore tools that will deliver a fast, fair and equitable just energy transition.

*liiitag Thato Gabaitse is the Development & Administrative Director at WE, The World.

Faten Aggad: A doubtful deal but now we look to COP30

Despite tensions and a significant level of mistrust generated by how the negotiating process was managed, a deal was delivered for the parties to take home. This demonstrated a clear commitment of the parties, especially developing countries, to remain constructive. The expectation from this goal was to signal ambition that would eventually underpin the design of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) expected to be delivered at COP30 in Belém and address the shortfalls of the implementation of the $100 billion goal. We got a deal but whether it delivered on expectations is doubtful.

The commitment to deliver $300 billion is a symbolic but minimal increase from the $100 billion floor taking into account inflation. It remains below the $1.3 trillion figure asked for by developing countries let alone their real needs. The text also does not secure high quality financing in the form of grants and concessional finance although admittedly provides guidance on how it can be addressed by acknowledging the role of debt, for example. It is now incumbent on institutions with decision making power over these issues to act upon the decision of COP29.

That being said, the silver lining is that the final text does not speak of a final goal. The launch of the Baku to Belém Roadmap towards the $1.3 trillion figure means that the pledged $300 billion is a floor and acknowledges therefore that more efforts are required to meet the needs of developing countries. This is a welcomed development that will ensure that the negotiations continue. Ensuring that the process is more consultative and inclusive than it has been over the last two weeks of negotiations will hopefully help land a more acceptable financial commitment by COP30. This will be crucial if developing countries are to deliver ambitious NDCs. For now it is just a rain check!

*liiitag Faten Aggad is Executive Director of the African Future Policies Hub (AFPH).

Mohamed Adow: Rich countries staged a great escape, and a betrayal of people and planet

This COP has been a disaster for the developing world. Sadly, it has been a betrayal of both people and planet by wealthy countries who claim to take climate change seriously.

Rich countries have promised to "mobilise" some funds in the future, rather than provide them now. It's like they are saying "the cheque is in the mail". But lives and livelihoods across Africa are being lost now. The rich world staged a great escape in Baku. With no real money on the table, and vague and unaccountable promises of funds to be mobilised, they are trying to shirk their climate finance obligations.

Part of the problem was how shamefully the hosts Azerbaijan led the summit. It has been a global embarrassment for the wealthy countries, and the COP president that allowed them to dodge their obligations. Next year's meeting in Brazil should be much better coordinated.

African leaders must now look to pool their complementary resources, work together, and seek opportunities to harness its great clean energy potential. We now need to seek ways of attracting the right investments into the continent to make us a renewable energy superpower.

*liiitag Mohamed Adow is the director of Power Shift Africa.

HD 	Can Pay, Won't Pay - COP29 Outcome Far From Promised Historic Deal of a Lifetime

They say it is taboo to talk about money. But this is exactly what developing countries came for: to haggle and push for the climate finance deal of a lifetime, as the climate crisis is, for them, a matter of life and death. Wealthy nations also came for their own deal of a lifetime--to hoist the climate finance burden on the private sector as they take the bare minimum financial responsibility.

A finance COP was always going to be difficult as, although they can pay, they simply will not pay. Mere hours before the expected final text of the "Host Country" Agreement to be signed between the Government of Azerbaijan and the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the COP29 presidency released a draft text proposing that the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance would be USD 250 billion.

TD 
	

Developing world wanted USD 1.3 trillion. The offer sparked outrage from the Global South, silent Baku protests, and threats of boycott as "no deal was better than a bad deal."

In the pandemonium, Brazil too warned there would be no deal unless COP29 raised the climate finance target. What followed were accusations and counter-accusations as negotiations overran into the wee hours of Sunday morning when the COP29 Presidency finally announced a deal of USD 300 billion.

"This new finance goal is an insurance policy for humanity, amid worsening climate impacts hitting every country," said Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change. "But like any insurance policy, it only works if premiums are paid in full and on time. Promises must be kept to protect billions of lives."

The new deal triples public finance to developing countries, from the previous goal of USD 100 billion annually to USD 300 billion annually by 2035, and secures efforts of all actors to work together to scale up finance to developing countries, from public and private sources, to the amount of USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2035.

Responding to the outcome of the COP29 climate summit, Mohamed Adow, director of climate and energy think tank Power Shift Africa, said COP29 has been "a disaster for the developing world. It is a betrayal of both people and planet by wealthy countries that claim to take climate change seriously. Rich countries have promised to "mobilise" some funds in the future, rather than provide them now."

"The cheque is in the mail. But lives and livelihoods in vulnerable countries are being lost now. At this 'Finance COP' not a single dollar of real climate finance has been provided right now. Not only did the global north impose a low-ball finance figure, it comes into force 11 years from now. This deal is too little, too late."

Adow said the rich world staged "a great escape in Baku. With no real money on the table and vague and unaccountable promises of funds to be mobilised, they are trying to shirk their climate finance obligations. Leaving the world without the resources needed to avert climate catastrophe. Poor countries needed to see clear, grant-based climate finance that would boost their ability to deal with the impacts of the climate crisis and accelerate their decarbonisation efforts. But that was sorely lacking."

Fadhel Kaboub, a member of the Independent Expert Group on Just Transition and Development, says the USD 1.3 trillion per year that the Global South asked for is meant to be a modest and reasonable good faith downpayment towards real climate action by the Global North. He said, "In the Global South, climate finance needs to come in the form of grants, not loans and further economic entrapment, cancellation of all climate-related debts, and transfer and sharing of life-saving technologies to manufacture and deploy renewables, clean cooking, clean transportation, and the climate resilience and adaptation infrastructure that we need."

Energies were low on the final official day of negotiations; the vibrant conversations that filled the air and purposeful walks from plenary to pavilions and back were long gone. The wait did not pay off. Fred Njehu, Pan-African Political Strategist, Greenpeace Africa, said that while developed nations continue to "dodge their responsibilities, our communities are drowning, starving, and losing their homes to a crisis they didn't create."

COP29 brought together nearly 200 countries. The most debated issues in Baku were around the NCQG, the Global Goal on Adaptation, and the Just Transition Work Programme. In the end, other highlights included the agreement on how carbon markets will operate under the Paris Agreement, making country-to-country trading and a carbon crediting mechanism fully operational.

On transparent climate reporting, Parties agreed to build a stronger evidence base to strengthen climate policies over time, helping to identify financing needs and opportunities. The COP decision on matters relating to the least developed countries (LDCs) contains a provision for the establishment of a support program for the implementation of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) for the LDCs.

COP29 took a decisive step forward to elevate the voices of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in climate action, adopting the Baku Workplan and renewing the mandate of the Facilitative Working Group (FWG) of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP).

Countries agreed a decision on gender and climate change, extending the enhanced Lima Work Programme on Gender and Climate Change for another 10 years, reaffirming the importance of gender equality and advancing gender mainstreaming throughout the convention. They also agreed to develop a new gender action plan for adoption at COP30, which will set the direction for concrete implementation.

"No country got everything they wanted, and we leave Baku with a mountain of work to do," said Stiell. "The many other issues we need to progress may not be headlines, but they are lifelines for billions of people. So, this is no time for victory laps; we need to set our sights and redouble our efforts on the road to Belem.

HD 	COP29 - Outraged Climate Experts Call New $250bn Text a 'Slap in the Face'

With the climate talks on the brink, campaigners and experts call the latest draft a "disgrace" and say "no deal is better than a bad deal".

On the final official day of the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, climate experts and civil society figures have responded with dismay at the latest text on climate finance. They have called on negotiators to reject what they refer to as "a slap in the face" and "an insult".

TD 
	

The new text on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) sets a climate finance goal of $250 billion per year by 2035. This would more than double the previous target of $100 billion per year and is consistent with earlier reports that European Union negotiators had been discussing a figure of $200-300 billion.

It is, however, a small fraction of the $1.3 trillion per year figure around which developing countries had united during COP29. When asked about the "$200 billion" figure rumoured to be being discussed by developed countries on Wednesday, negotiators from Bolivia, Uganda, and Kenya asked "is it a joke?" The $1.3 trillion sum takes into account the fact that developing countries are estimated to need $215-$387 billion per year for climate adaption, $447-$894 billion per year to compensate for loss and damage, and billions more to facilitate an energy transition.

The new NCQG text also clarifies that the proposed $250 billion per year will come "from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources". This also goes against developing countries' demands that a significant portion of the goal come from governments, not including private finance mobilised by public money. Earlier in negotiations, the Arab Group had set a figure of $440 billion, India $600 billion and the small islands bloc $900 billion for specifically public finance.

The responses so far to the latest text among climate experts, activists, and civil society figures have been clear and firm.

"Our expectations were low, but this is a slap in the face," says Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa. "What trick is the presidency trying to pull? They've already disappointed everyone, but they have now angered and offended the developing world...We need developed countries to grab the bull by the horns and put forward a number that reflects the actual needs of developing countries. Rich countries need to bypass this president and negotiate eye to eye with developing countries."

"$250 billion is far, far too low and it literally makes me tremble with anger," says Namrata Chowdhary, Chief of Public Engagement at 350.org. "We need $1.3 trillion...and every subtraction of the money is a betrayal of the Global South...Any ambition we talked in the morning is missing."

"We join civil society, communities, and movements to condemn the text, to condemn the developed nations," adds Gerry Arances, Executive Director of the Centre for Energy, Ecology, and Development (CEED). "Who comes with that kind of face and shows up here, [claiming] to head climate leadership. Is that climate leadership? We will not allow communities in the Global South to be be dictated to by these rich nations."

"What the Global North is offering is not just a joke; it is an insult to all the delegations present at COP29," says Fadhel Kaboub, a member of the Independent Expert Group on Just Transition and Development. "I call on all Global South delegations to stand strong, stand united, be firm, and be ready to walk out if necessary...No Deal is Better than a Bad Deal. We are the global majority...If the historic polluters of the global minority do not get serious about its responsibilities, then we may have to start restricting access to our strategic minerals and our markets, and start leveraging our collective economic weight to save the planet for all of humanity."

"This $250 billion from developed countries is a disgrace," says Harjeet Singh, Global Engagement Director at the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. "The developed countries are fully aware of the importance of climate action, yet they have the audacity to offer this paltry amount. They are saying that MDDs (Multilateral Development Banks) are going to be providing the fund, which means more loans. There is no reference to grants, which means there is no commitment that climate funds will be provided in form of grants. There is no reference to fossil fuels, but just a remark on just transition. If this is how money is going to be provided, we urge developing countries to stand firm and reject this with dignity. No deal is better than a bad deal."

"This is worse than what we imagined. The $100 billion that was tabled in 2009 was even better than we got today," says Lidy Nacpil of the Asian Peoples' Movement on Debt and Development referring to the calculation that, given inflation, $250 billion in today's money is 30% less than $100 billion was in 2009. "There are many clever words used in the text to allow the developed world get away with a lot of things...We can't accept this text. We rather fight for something much bigger than accept something that doesn't have a shred of decency. We call upon developing countries to demand what is right fully theirs or, if not, walk away."

The text will be continue to be negotiated today in what has become a race against time. Many diplomats will leave Baku on Saturday, potentially leaving talks logjammed without quorum to make a decision.

HD 	COP29 - New Funding Proposal for Developing Countries Sparks Debate Amidst Huge Disparity

With less than 48 hours to the end of the COP negotiations in Baku, Parties and delegations from Global South are gunning for a $1.3 trillion new annual climate finance target, designed to provide support for vulnerable climate frontline communities.

Experts in climate change and delegations attending the ongoing 29th Edition of the United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, have raised significant concerns regarding the new funding proposals aimed at assisting developing countries address crises induced by climate change.

TD 
	

The fresh text proposal

published Thursday by the United Nations Climate body (UNFCCC), came after over nine days of ongoing climate talks in Baku.

The fresh text embodies funding options and how much money wealthy countries should provide poorer nations to help them address climate change impacts as enshrined in Parties Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs) documents submitted to the (UNFCCC) as mandated by the 2015 Paris Agreement.

The ten-page document released and reviewed by this newspaper clearly indicated funding options proposed for developing countries to adapt to lingering scourge of climate change, however, there are huge disparities with regard to the funding demands of the developing countries (Global South).

While the summit is set to wrap up on Friday, the new document has attracted wide reaction from climate activists, observers and delegations across the negotiating blocs amidst perceived gaps in the proposed text.

A review of the new text shows that no definite/specific amount has been agreed on how much rich countries are to pay poorer nations annually to combat climate change effects believed to be caused by the wealthy nations. There are still lingering concerns on key questions tilting towards: what is the annual figure? Who pays and how much?

'The new text rightly diagnoses the climate problem, including the required finance for adaptation and energy transition, but glaringly omits what the rich countries will actually provide to developing countries," said Mohamed Adow, Founder and Director of Power Shift Africa, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES.

At the ongoing COP29 summit, dubbed the "finance COP", developing countries, particularly Africa, are demanding at least $1.3 trillion annually by the end of the decade to cope with climate change effects.

Parties and delegations are enthusiastic about world leaders fulfilling the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) target, designed to provide support for vulnerable communities in global climate solutions.

Key recognitions

The newly published text, among several recognitions, noted the need for the implementation of the NCQG to reflect the evolving needs and capabilities of countries.

Similarly, it acknowledges that developing countries suffer the disproportionate impacts of climate change, whilst facing various barriers and challenges, including high costs of capital, limited fiscal space, high levels of indebtedness, and high transaction costs, which also further exacerbate existing developmental challenges.

Decisions

Additionally, among several decisions proposed in the newly published text, the Parties decided to establish a New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance of "at least USD [X] trillion of dollars annually, from 2025-2035, provided and mobilised from developed to all developing countries and to address their evolving needs."

According to the new text, this would be in "grants or grant-equivalent terms of new, additional, affordable, predictable, non-debt inducing and adequate climate finance, for adaptation, mitigation and loss and damage, to support developing country Parties, in a country-driven manner, in the implementation of their National Determined Contributions, Long-term strategies, National Adaptation Plans, Climate Finance Strategies, Technology Action Plans, among other nationally identified plans and strategies or other instruments"

"Lack of specific numbers"

Based on the aforementioned paragraph of the text, Mr Adow said the elephant in the room is the "lack of specific numbers in the text".

"This is the 'finance COP'. We came here to talk about money. The way you measure money is with numbers. We need a cheque, but all we have right now is a blank piece of paper," he noted.

He acknowledged that the newly proposed text includes some important signals on grant based financing, and the need to avoid debt-inducing instruments.

However, the climate Justice activist said developed countries now urgently need to fill in the blanks and put their finance card on the table to move the negotiations forward.

On his part, David Tong, Global Industry Campaign Manager, Oil Change International (OCI), said the key energy transition package agreed last year in Dubai is absolutely still alive, but ambition has gone missing in the mitigation work programme.

"And the reality is that this is because without finance there is no phase out and we are seeing wealthy nations refusing to step forward with the quantum needed for climate finance. Without finance, there is no phase-out," he said during a press briefing at the COP29 media centre on Thursday morning.

The climate expert said "the energy transition must be financed, adaptation must be financed. Loss and damage must be financed. That is crucial to achieving a breakthrough across these texts."

"We are seeing very divergent options. Options that are strong and options that are weak with the exception of the mitigation work programme where the ambitious option is simply not there," he noted.

COP29

This year, the world's famous climate summit -COP29, dubbed the "finance COP" is expected to deliver a more ambitious climate finance target to help vulnerable countries address climate change impacts.

With less than 48 hours to the end of the COP negotiations in Baku, Parties and delegations are enthusiastic about world leaders fulfilling the NCQG target, designed to provide support for vulnerable communities in global climate solutions.

However, many delegates and negotiators, particularly those from the Global South have expressed displeasure over perceived weak commitments and sabotage from wealthy nations.

HD 	'The Worst First Week of a COP' - Frustrations Rise As Week Two Begins

Negotiators and activists from Africa say there has been very little positive progress at COP29 as well as a worrying focus on false solutions.

As the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan enter their second week, the theme of the first has been one of slow progress and frustration, according to many participants from Africa.

TD 
	

Dubbed the "finance COP", the main focus of this year's negotiations has been the new climate finance goal, known as the New Collective Quantified Goals (NCGQ). Developing countries want the Global North to commit to mobilising $1.3 trillion per year by 2030, and for this sum to be reviewed based on evolving needs. This sum would replace the existing $100 billion per year commitment. However, the first half of the COP29 has yielded barely any progress on this front. Climate experts and negotiators from the Global South are getting increasingly impatient and agitated.

"This has been the worst first week of a COP in my 15 years attending these summits," says Mohamed Adow, the director and founder of energy think tank, Power Shift Africa. "There is no clarity on the finance goal, the quality of the finance, or how it's going to be made accessible to vulnerable countries."

In an open letter, an influential group of leaders including former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon together, former COP heads, and prominent climate experts decried the process. "It is now clear that the Cop is no longer fit for purpose. We need a shift from negotiation to implementation," they wrote.

For now, though, negotiators from developing countries are cooped up meeting rooms determined to push for their needs.

"The Global North should pay for their climate damages," says Professor Isaac Kalonda, a negotiator from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. "We are tired of them playing all games. They need to pay for their climate catastrophes, and it should be based on our needs."

The biggest obstacle, African negotiators say, is countries from the Global North trying to "redefine the commitments and the obligations" of the Paris Agreement.

So far, three draft texts at COP29 have been rejected by the negotiators from Africa. The first two, they said, were "imbalanced" and unfair in a way that "does not align with the needs of vulnerable countries". They also objected to their heavy emphasis on private-sector financing without "clear assurances for direct public finance contributions".

"Private finance often comes with terms that are less favourable for low-income countries, including conditions that can lead to debt accumulation", read a joint statement by the African Group of Negotiators (AGN). "Our stance is that developed countries should first fulfil their obligations for public climate finance."

Fadhel Kaboub, President of the Global Institute for Sustainable Prosperity, warns that relying on the private sector will pressure African governments into negotiating unfavourable deals with multinational corporations for investment.

"Climate debt is a responsibility of the Global North who have to tax and regulate the private sector in their own jurisdiction to raise the financial and technological resources that would then be transferred to the Global South," he says. "Funds should be predictable, concessional, and accessible."

The latest draft text has elicited mixed reactions. Ali Mohamed, Chair of the AGN, says that while some progress has been made, the first week of COP29 "raises significant risks" as they move into week two. He stresses that the final agreement on the NCQG should prioritise adaptation with meaningful outcomes that address the unique challenges facing Africa. This is "no longer an option" but a "necessity", he adds.

"We are not here to secure just any deal, but one that ensures the most vulnerable nations receive the support they need to cope with and mitigate climate impacts," he says. "We need a deal that addresses finance, technology transfer, loss, and damage and ensures robust accountability for the promises made".

Civil society organisations have made their own demands too. They fear that COP29 has been hijacked by fossil fuel lobbyists, 1,700 of whom are attending the talks. They also note that the hosts of the past two COPs -- Azerbaijan and the UAE -- are petrostates with poor human rights records. In a petition to African negotiators, thousands of activists have demanded investments in renewable energies, the end of fossil fuel use, and that fossil fuel producers pay for climate damages.

"This petition represents the voices of thousands of Africans who are already experiencing the devastating impacts of climate change," says Murtala Touray, Programme Director at Greenpeace Africa. "We are calling on our negotiators to stand firm in demanding that fossil fuel companies to pay their fair share for the damage they've caused to our communities and environment."

Makoma Lekalakala, Executive Director of Earth Life Africa in South Africa, accuses oil and gas firms of "stripping Africans of their dignity" by uprooting communities from their ancestral homes and destroying their livelihoods.

Despite these pushbacks, fossil fuel lobbyists remain a loud voice at COP29. For instance, the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), a coalition of 21 gas exporting and consuming countries, continues to advocate for the fossil fuel, saying "Africa needs it more than ever".

"Why should the West dictate what Africa needs?" asked Mohammed Amid Naderian, GECF Head of Economics and Forecasting Department. Abubakar Jibrin Abbas, GECF Senior Energy Forecast Analyst, added "fossil fuels are still relevant because it is cheap and Africa is still the least emitter of carbon, which on top of that, is absorbed by the forest".

Many African climate experts have argued against these suggestions, pointing out that the continent's own climate movement vehemently opposes fossil fuels and that renewable energies can provide the energy Africa needs many times over.

"Africa's future must be renewable, not fossil-fuelled," says Fred Njehu, Pan-African Political Strategist for Greenpeace Africa. "Our climate negotiators have a historic opportunity at COP29 to champion real sustainable solutions that will protect our communities and ecosystems".

As the first week of the COP29 neared its end, a group of activists from Africa and the Global South gathered to condemn a myriad of "eye-watering false solutions", including fossil fuels, geoengineering, artificial intelligence, and carbon capture storage. They described such ideas as "colonial extractive tactics" used to hoodwink developing countries. They also cautioned against framing carbon trading as a form of climate finance, saying it only diverts attention from the direct financial needs that developed countries must pay vulnerable countries.

"Not all that glitters is green," says Dean Bhebhe, senior Just Transitions and Campaign Advisor at Power Shift Africa. "Energy transition is cheaper than climate catastrophe - and we are here to fight it".

HD 	From the Biodiversity COP16 to the Climate COP29 - Building Equitable Accountability, Alignment, and Adequacy On Finance

The United States just went through its most consequential election. While the outcome raises questions about what the re-election of Trump means for U.S. engagement in global climate talks moving forward (in view of his previous stunt), the game is still on, with or without him. Despite the challenges, local communities, cities, states, private actors, and the public more broadly have embarked on an unstoppable journey--upholding the spirit of the Paris Agreement.

The world's biodiversity agreement just faced its first big test in Cali, Colombia, at the United Nations' 16th Biodiversity Conference of the Parties (COP16). The results were decidedly mixed, with some breakthroughs but also critical missed opportunities. Ultimately, it left the international community with a suite of urgent priorities to address our rapidly closing window to halt biodiversity collapse and to align the protection of nature with action on climate change.

TD 
	

With countries rapidly pivoting to the UN climate conference (COP29) this week, they will need to build on COP16's successes and mitigate its failures, prioritizing the equitable delivery of main "AAA" objectives that are relevant to both: accountability, the alignment of biodiversity and climate plans, and the adequacy of resource mobilization and access to finance.

COP16 in Cali was the first Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) COP since the December 2022 adoption of the landmark Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF or, commonly, GBF). The GBF set forth a plan to reverse and halt biodiversity loss by 2030 through the achievement of 23 action-oriented targets and to live in harmony with nature by 2050 by meeting four overarching goals.

COP16 offered a chance to make progress on the AAA objectives, as they are essential to delivering on the GBF, while also ensuring equity is built into each of them. These objectives manifest in some of COP16's most notable outcomes, including the adoption of a work program and the creation of a permanent subsidiary body on Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs) under the CBD, with a recognition of the role of Afro-descendants. The outcomes also included decisions on a historic and long-overdue fund to foster equitable benefits sharing from their knowledge.

Overall, however, the international community left Cali with a long road ahead for meaningful, enduring, and equitable implementation.

Accountability

A long history of failed promises on biodiversity cast a broad shadow as the international community began negotiations at COP16. None of the biodiversity conservation targets set for 2010-2020 were fully met, making the challenge of halting and reversing biodiversity loss in the following decades much harder. While parties to the CBD have had two years since adopting the GBF to revise their National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), which are supposed to detail how they will fulfill their GBF obligations, only about 22 percent of countries had done so by the conclusion of the COP.

Developed countries have been particularly notorious for sidestepping accountability, especially on forest commitments. For decades, international policy has largely focused on addressing deforestation in the tropics while allowing the wealthier countries of the Global North to evade scrutiny for their own forest degradation. As countries chart their ambition under the GBF and related commitments at the intersection of nature and climate, voices from the Global South, including the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, have begun calling for frameworks to drive more equitable accountability.

The GBF's monitoring framework presented an opportunity to begin correcting this imbalance through the adoption of concrete, shared indicators to guide biodiversity protection and restoration. Instead, in the months leading up to COP16, negotiators began building a monitoring framework that risks cloaking business as usual under the guise of progress. Ultimately, without additional revisions and willingness to strengthen the indicators, the monitoring framework will be subject to the same inequities and weaknesses that have plagued policies for decades.

As countries look to build accountability, the enhanced transparency framework and global stocktake under the UN climate convention can provide models for how to bring more teeth into the CBD process and foster responsibility for all parties. In addition, wealthy countries need to ensure their NBSAPs are action-oriented and to hold themselves to the same standards on deforestation and forest degradation that they expect in the tropics.

There may also be opportunities to channel success elsewhere into greater accountability on biodiversity conservation. One example is the progressing ratification of the new high seas treaty, which is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for biodiversity conservation at a global scale. The treaty must be ratified by 60 nations to come into force and then be effectively implemented, both of which saw progress at COP16 with the announcement of Panama's ratification during the COP and several countries confirming the signing of the treaty and announcing intentions to start working on the first round of high seas marine protected areas.

Alignment of biodiversity and climate efforts

Biodiversity loss and climate change are inextricably linked, requiring aligned, synergistic action. The UN biodiversity and climate conventions have historically been siloed, resulting in disconnected, sometimes conflicting decision-making and ambition. Last December, at the UN climate conference in Dubai (COP28), countries agreed to the first global stocktake, which emphasized the need to halt and reverse deforestation and forest degradation by 2030 and to align with the GBF.

COP16 created an opening for fostering that alignment and ensuring coordination and complementarity. Parties agreed to establish a process, with submissions of views from all stakeholders by May 2025, for coordinating between the three Rio Conventions (addressing climate, biodiversity, and desertification). This creates a pathway for ensuring that climate mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity protection and restoration mutually reinforce each other's priorities.

At COP29, negotiators should build off of this leadership, elevating the need to integrate climate and biodiversity commitments and reinforcing the importance of an efficient, robust collaboration process. Particularly given next year's ocean and climate summits in France and Brazil, respectively, which will thrust oceans and forests to the forefront of the climate agenda, it is imperative that countries set the stage for the alignment between biodiversity and climate commitments, create opportunities for the exchange of lessons and best practices between the conventions, and deliver more robust and ambitious climate and biodiversity plans as soon as possible, and no later than in a year's time in 2025.

Adequacy of finance

As at COP15, the issue causing the greatest rift at COP16 was the question of how to fund the biodiversity conservation called for in the GBF. Since the signing of the GBF, positions--particularly divisions between developed and developing countries--have only hardened. The European Union announced in September that it was opposed to a key demand of developing countries: the creation of a new finance mechanism to distribute biodiversity finance. At the same time, the Ministerial Alliance for Ambition on Nature Finance released a statement from 20 Global South countries calling on the Global North to meet the commitments it made in the GBF to ensure that at least $20 billion per year is delivered from developed to developing countries by 2025 and that at least $30 billion per year is delivered by 2030.

Unfortunately, discussions on these issues started too late in the negotiations and dragged into the last day of the COP, until the meeting ended abruptly for lack of a quorum. The aborted talks adjourned with no agreed-upon strategy for increasing funds to finance nature conservation. Countries will now continue talks next year at an interim meeting.

This result is unacceptable. The vast majority of countries in the Global South will not have the resources necessary to meet their obligations in the GBF if the Global North does not meet its funding commitments.

The problem is compounded given that some of the key sticking points of biodiversity finance echo discussions about climate finance. For example, under the UN climate convention, there have been similar disagreements around appropriate finance mechanisms, such as around the creation of the Loss and Damage Fund in 2022. During those and other discussions, diverging opinions around sources of finance, transparency, and access to funding have stymied progress. Now, with the inconclusive end of COP16 on these issues, there is even larger, more entrenched distrust between developed and developing countries.

At COP29, countries need to agree to a new, ambitious climate finance goal to build the needed confidence among governments and the private sector to pursue more ambitious climate action that also drives the protection of nature; the richest and most-polluting countries must therefore dramatically enhance their efforts.

This is not charity--it is investment for economic and social justice, a matter of national, food, and energy security, and it is essential to building a climate-safer world for all.

Ultimately, all countries will get hurt by climate impacts with billions' worth of damages. The richest countries are not immune to this (as we saw most recently in the United States and Spain), and they all need to step up. A deal on finance cannot just hinge on the United States. That was true before, and it's truer now.

Looking forward

For both climate and nature, 2030 is a deadline that will dictate our future. By then, the international community will need to have implemented transformative change across all sectors, establishing climate-safe, nature-positive economies while ensuring equity and human rights.

Government progress, including at the subnational level, on accountability, alignment, and adequacy of finance is particularly critical given the unprecedented attention from the private sector on biodiversity and climate risks and outcomes. Companies and investors had a major presence at COP16--they are paying close attention to these negotiations and to the growing risks of failing to take action. Signals from the government are critical to pushing money flows and supply chains toward sustainable, equitable outcomes and building the structures that will transform business practices.

COP16 made important strides but ultimately left far too much on the table. At COP29 and beyond, parties need to renew trust and pursue their resolve to rapidly scale up and invest in holistic, equitable, all-of-planet approaches that propel action at every level of society and government, finally turning global commitments into reality on the ground. COP29 needs to and can deliver.

Industry influx escalates calls to protect talks from Big Polluters

Friday 15 November 2024, London - At least 1,773 fossil fuel lobbyists have been granted access to the COP29 summit in Baku, underscoring an outsized polluter presence year after year at crucial climate talks, according to a new analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) coalition.

TD 
	

As with last year's COP28 climate talks in Dubai, significantly more fossil lobbyists have been granted access to COP29 than almost every country delegation - the 1,773 fossil fuel lobbyists registered in Baku are only outnumbered by delegations sent by host Azerbaijan (2,229), COP30 host Brazil (1,914), and Türkiye (1,862).

The Kick Big Polluters Out coalition analysed the provisional list of participants at COP29 line-by-line. Among the additional topline findings:

*liiitag Fossil fuel lobbyists have received more passes to COP29 than all the delegates from the 10 most climate-vulnerable nations combined (1,033), underscoring how industry presence is dwarfing that of those on the frontlines of the climate crisis.

*liiitag A vast number of fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access to the COP as part of a trade association. Eight of the top 10 trade groups with the most lobbyists came from the Global North. The largest was the International Emissions Trading Association, who brought 43 people including representatives from Big Polluters TotalEnergies and Glencore.

*liiitag Japan brought coal giant Sumitomo as part of its delegation; Canada bought oil producers Suncor and Tourmaline; the United Kingdom brought 20 lobbyists; and Italy brought employees of energy giants Eni and Enel.

*liiitag Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and Eni, which brought a combined total of 39 lobbyists, are also linked to enabling genocide in Palestine by "fuelling Israel's war machine."

Kick Big Polluters Out member Nnimmo Bassey from Health of Mother Earth Foundation said:

"The fossil fuel lobby's grip on climate negotiations is like a venomous snake coiling around the very future of our planet. We must expose their deceit and take decisive action to remove their influence and make them pay for their infractions towards our planet. It's time to prioritise the voices of those who have been fighting for justice and sustainability, not the interests of polluters."

The KBPO findings come at the end of a year in which global temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions shattered records, and amidst evidence of fossil fuel complicity in genocide in Palestine via the supply of oil and gas to Israel. They also come amidst revelations that many of the world's largest fossil fuel corporations have approved US$250 billion in oil and gas expenditure since COP28.

Industry presence in Baku stands in stark contrast to the stated aims of COP29, where ending fossil fuels, false solutions and climate finance are all hot topics. It further substantiates the growing call from Global South countries, public officials, UN constituencies and wider civil society to eject polluters from talks.

Beyrra Triasdian from Trend Asia Big Polluters' stranglehold on climate action said:

"We are continually dictated by the fossil fuel industry, which has destroyed people's homes and livelihoods. Many islands in Indonesia have sunk, droughts and floods are now common, and fields are no longer productive because of the climate crisis. COP has been held 29 times, and climate change continues to get worse, while fossil fuel lobbyists flee their responsibility and use false solutions to prolong the fossil fuel era."

Corporate access and lobbying at UN climate talks isn't limited to the fossil fuel industry. Other polluting industries deeply implicated in the climate crisis such as finance, agribusiness and transportation are also present, although they are not included in this analysis. KBPO counts only organisations or delegations as fossil fuel lobbyists if they can be reasonably assumed to have the objective of influencing the formulation or implementation of policy or legislation in the interests of a fossil fuel corporation and its shareholders.

The number of fossil fuel representatives at UN climate talks has been consistently high, with the industry present since their inception. These findings build on calls in recent years to protect the UN's climate negotiations by establishing clear conflict of interest policies and accountability measures, with countries collectively representing almost 70% of the world's population having requested these conflicts of interest be addressed.

Thanks to sustained pressure from civil society, COP28 was the first time COP attendees were required to disclose who they represent, revealing many lobbyists who would likely have attended previous COPs incognito.

Last year, KBPO's analysis showed that an historic high of more than 2,450 fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access to the COP28 climate talks in Dubai, up from 636 the year before that in Egypt.

Despite the overall number of participants this year (52,305) being significantly less than the 97,372 last year in Dubai, the fossil fuel industry still appears to have descended on Baku in extraordinary numbers.

The Kick Big Polluters Out campaign is calling on the UN climate body and governments to continue on the road towards a robust Accountability Framework to address the problem at its root, to prioritie the millions of lives on the line by the climate crisis and lack of action to address it as with the tobacco industry at the World Health Organisation tobacco treaty talks.

Rachitaa Gupta of the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice said:

"For nearly 30 years, these actors have hijacked negotiations, sabotaging meaningful progress as our communities across the Global South bear the brutal brunt of the climate crisis, yet our voices remain marginalised in these critical discussions. No more compromises. These polluters need to be kicked out and it's time for us, Global South communities - those who have contributed least to this crisis yet suffer the most - to lead and shape real, just climate solutions over profit."

Additional quotes from KBPO members:

"COP29 kicked off with the revelation that fossil fuel deals were on the agenda, laying bare the ways that industry's constant presence has delayed and weakened progress for years. The fossil fuel industry is driven by their financial bottom line, which is fundamentally opposed to what is needed to stop the climate crisis, namely, the urgent and just phase out of fossil fuels. We don't have time for vested interests and delay tactics. Every year that we do not remove this influence is another year where we endanger our collective survival. It's time for our leaders to stand up for humanity and Kick Big Polluters Out." - Sarah McArthur, UK Youth Climate Coalition

"The same companies that poured money into Donald Trump's campaign are now stalking the halls of COP29, aiming to crush climate action. At this COP and in its remaining critical weeks, the Biden administration needs to treat the fossil fuel industry like the deadly, climate-killing machine that it is. At a minimum, Biden can buy lifesaving time by denying polluting behemoths like the CP2 LNG export terminal. And as Trump prepares to 'drill, baby, drill,' we're getting ready to 'sue, baby, sue' to defend bedrock environmental laws that protect wildlife and communities." - Ben Goloff, Center for Biological Diversity

"The fossil fuel industry has long manipulated climate negotiations to protect its interests while our planet burns. It's time to sever these ties and ensure that the voices of the Global South are amplified, not silenced. We must kick Big Polluters out of our climate conversations and make them Pay!" - Dawda Cham, from HELP -Gambia, Africa Make Big Polluters Pay Coalition

HD 	Climate Change - Women's Role in the Economy Is Key to a Just Transition

The realities of climate change are hitting home for many people living in the global south. Food security, water access and health have been jeopardised by the increased temperatures, extreme weather events and sea level rise.

In many places women are the primary caregivers for children, the sick or the elderly, as well as being responsible for cooking and cleaning in the household. This kind of work can be described as care work, which is often unpaid or underpaid.

TD 
	

The impacts of climate change will add to the required care work. This will put a strain on those who are responsible for these vital tasks. While women often do this work, it is also performed by children and other family members who can all take strain in these circumstances.

We are a group of gender equality and climate change and inequality researchers and economists who, in a recent working paper, proposed a set of principles that should be used for a "gender just transition". These are based on a review of empirical literature mainly from the global south on some of the unjust transitions already underway, as well as contributions by feminist scholars.

The transition to a low-carbon economy is underway across the world. However, gender justice is often neglected - and there is a risk that the transition won't be just at all.

In our paper we argue that a just transition requires a reckoning with power dynamics in climate policymaking.

The just transition

A just transition refers to the way in which a low- or zero-carbon economy is achieved. It should take economic and social justice concerns into account.

But there has been a lack of serious engagement with the gendered dimensions of justice in policies being developed for the just transition. This raises the risk that transition policies sustain or worsen gender (and other) inequalities.

This is particularly true in the global south, which is facing the greatest threats due to climate change and transition impacts.

Gender equality

Evidence suggests that the shift to renewable energy does not necessarily improve gender equity. Improved access to electricity can reduce the time needed for much housework. However, one case study in Zambia found that men often benefited from the increase in leisure time afforded by efficiencies in housework whereas women's labour was shifted to other tasks.

In India, a large renewable energy development led to land used for agriculture being sold or rented for renewable energy plants so the agricultural workers - most of whom were women - suffered loss of income.

In Zambia, electrification did not necessarily reduce the workload for cooking. This was mainly because solar minigrids did not have enough capacity to power electric cookstoves. While the minigrid increased incomes for local businesses, these benefits were mostly enjoyed by men who were the business owners.

In the case of a large solar power project in Morocco, women did not benefit because they were not landowners who could earn rental income. They did not participate in decision-making either.

Renewable electrification cannot be assumed to improve gender relations. If the energy transition ignores these inequalities, they could grow.

A just transition and gender justice

We combined insights on the gendered impacts of transition with feminist theory. This allowed us to expand on the key principles for just transition in a way that supports gender equality. These principles include:

*liiitag Participatory justice: taking an equal part in decision-making and having accountable governance.

*liiitag Distributive justice: the equal distribution of positive and negative impacts of transition.

*liiitag Recognitional justice: recognising existing inequalities and contributions, and aiming to incorporate diverse knowledges and values.

*liiitag Restorative justice: Acknowledging existing harms of environmental degradation and climate change which must be redressed and remediated.

We incorporated feminist perspectives to provide new interpretations of these principles:

Distributive justice: Equal access to resources and employment for all genders is central to feminist thought. The transition to a low-carbon economy is expected to benefit some and disadvantage others. Those who don't have access to water, land or livelihoods are at greater risk in the transition.

Therefore, a gender just transition requires public and affordable provision of social goods. This includes education, healthcare, child and elderly care, energy and water infrastructure, and social protection - to relieve and redistribute care work.

Read more: Climate change is hitting women the hardest. What to do about it -- economists

A feminist approach to distributive justice requires thinking about how the economy is organised, what types of labour are valued, and how economic resources are distributed.

Participatory justice: Feminist theories focus attention on inequality, whether based on gender, race, class, ethnicity, or other categories. Feminists highlight the role of power in knowledge creation and who is called an "expert". Participatory justice for a gender just transition should shift the focus of participation in policymaking from elites to excluded groups, whose input should be valued as experts in their own contexts.

Recognitional justice: Feminist theory promotes a view of climate change and just transition as complex social problems. This recognises that humans are embedded in nature and acknowledges the important work that many groups are doing for sustainability and climate change. Recognitional justice should therefore acknowledge existing inequalities and contributions, and aim to incorporate diverse knowledge systems and values.

Restorative justice: Restorative justice should acknowledge, compensate and repair harms which are gendered. For example, industries such as coal mining have affected men and women in different ways. The environment also needs repair. Options for climate reparations must be explored at the local and global level.

Exploring the evidence of the gendered impacts of climate change and transition in the global south, and using feminist theory to extract key lessons which can be applied to the commonly used pillars of justice, allows for a more expansive and radical view of justice for a gender just transition.

A gender just transition requires a reckoning with power dynamics in climate policymaking.

Governments, development banks and all stakeholders working on efforts to achieve a just transition should use an expansive view of justice in order to address inequality of all kinds.

Global climate activists intensified their demands at COP29 in Baku, calling for developed countries to take accountability for climate change impacts that continue to devastate communities across the Global South.

During an eye-catching demonstration held ahead of the Finance Day, climate activists displayed a massive "invoice" listing the mounting costs of climate destruction, highlighting the urgent need for financial redress.

TD 
	

"The time for excuses is up. Developed countries simply need to own up for the harm they have caused. It is absurd that people in the Global South who have done little to cause the crisis have been forced to bear the costs of climate destruction unleashed by richer countries.

"The giant invoice that we displayed today clearly itemizes the costs of loss and damage, adaptation, and mitigation already being borne by developing countries. If developing countries want to avert runaway climate breakdown, they need to repay the debt owed to the Global South." Said Teresa Anderson, the Global Lead on Climate Justice at ActionAid International

The action brought into sharp focus the inequities faced by vulnerable communities, particularly women and girls, whose lives have been disrupted by climate change.

Sylvia Kijangwa, a youth climate activist from Tanzania, related the daily challenges women and girls face in her homeland due to prolonged droughts, water scarcity, and food insecurity.

"In my country, women and young girls are increasingly forced to walk long distances in search of water, putting them at risk of attacks by wildlife and abuse at water wells. This Finance Day, we demand justice for these women who come from countries that have contributed the least to the climate crisis. Our children are suffering from malnutrition due to the food crisis as empty promises become the norm. COP29 is the right time to provide finance for the costs of climate impacts that we are still paying." Kijangwa said

Echoing Kijangwa's call for action, Nura Mohamed, Program Manager of ActionAid Somaliland, drew attention to the urgent need for substantial financial commitments, particularly to protect vulnerable women and girls from severe economic and social impacts in Somaliland.

"Women and girls in Somaliland cannot wait any longer as major polluters continue to evade accountability for the climate debts owed to communities devastated by climate change. For women and girls, the impacts are severe--droughts endanger livelihoods, and the resulting economic hardships fuel surges in gender-based violence and FGM/C. The delay is over. With climate shocks threatening our very survival, we are now demanding climate finance in the trillions, not the billions," Mohamed said

The activists implored those future promises be backed by concrete financing mechanisms, arguing that immediate action is essential to stave off further climate-induced suffering.

HD 	'Extremely Urgent' - an Interview With the Head of the Adaptation Fund

With the Global South hoping COP29 can bring progress on the $215-387 bn per year needed for adaptation, we spoke to the head of the Adaptation Fund.

At international climate talks, discussions around adapting to the climate crisis have often taken a back seat to negotiations over how to reduce emissions. Though this imbalance arguably continues, the efforts of vulnerable countries have put adaptation more firmly on the agenda. At COP29 in Azerbaijan, negotiators from the Global South will again be pushing for progress on adaptation - especially on the question of funding, which currently falls many orders short of what is needed.

TD 
	

As COP29 gets underway, African Arguments interviewed Mikko Ollikainen, Head of the Adaptation Fund. Established in 2001 under the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Fund has committed over $1.2 billion for climate change adaptation and resilience projects since 2010. Ollikainen spoke of his expectations from COP29, the adaptation finance needs of developing countries, and maladaptation.

The Adaptation Gap report released in 2023 estimated annual adaptation costs in developing countries to be $215-387 billion this decade. In the past, developed countries have consistently fallen short of meeting such needs. With climate finance a big theme at COP29, what would you consider a successful outcome?

Indeed the gap continues to grow, particularly with rising temperatures and worsening climate impacts. The need to significantly scale-up adaptation this decade to address rising impacts is becoming extremely urgent to avoid increasing costs of inaction. We see this directly in the Adaptation Fund where our pipeline of projects in development that are not yet funded has grown to about $500 million. Our Board has set a Resource Mobilisation goal of $300 million this year as well as an increased number of contributors to move in the direction of helping to meet this need and enable the Fund to continue supporting vulnerable countries and communities in their efforts to address climate impacts.

Many developed countries, and the US in particular, often stress the importance of mobilising private finance to meet climate finance needs of developing countries. What do you make of the push for private financing? Do you think it could cover some adaptation costs?

To bridge the adaptation finance gap, we need to employ different types of mechanisms and instruments. However, it is important to highlight the critical role of public and grant-based financing for many developing countries, including for SIDS [Small Island Developing States], LDCs [Least Developed Countries] and many African countries, given the context of their fiscal environment. The Adaptation Fund's focus is on providing grant-based finance for the most vulnerable, who are often within a context that it's not attractive for private funding, and it's important that no one is left behind in an adaptation economy equation.

The Adaptation Fund grant-based funding is also important in creating the enabling environment and catalysing adaptation action to unlocking private finance resources. The Fund's Innovation windows, in particular, promote climate adaptation innovation and private sector development with focus on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. It's also worth noting that the Adaptation Fund was originally set up with an innovative financing mechanism of a share of proceeds from the carbon markets under the Kyoto Protocol, and we very much look forward to finalising the operationalisation of the Article 6.4 of the Paris agreement in COP29 to enable more flows for adaptation funding.

I have heard that there are procedural hurdles in accessing adaptation finance and also delays in the disbursal of funds. How is the Adaptation Fund working to resolve such issues?

The Adaptation Fund has proven effective in delivering and channelling adaptation finance to vulnerable countries and communities with one of the fastest project cycles, and a strong focus on country ownership, and the most vulnerable. Our time to disbursal is often much more expedient. Further, we pioneered Direct Access to climate finance which enables developing countries to nominate their own national implementing entity to identify and develop projects, eliminating a level in between that would typically be served by a multilateral implementing entity. That said, we are constantly trying to make our processes smoother and quicker to both accreditation of implementing partners and approval and disbursal of project funds, and we have done so through a number of policy improvements over the years. Mutual fast track accreditations/re-accreditations is one example, and our streamlined process for smaller entities is another.

We also recently opened new funding modalities dedicated to locally-led adaptation (LLA), which aim to make funding adaptation more easily accessible to local actors, organisations and communities and ensure that they are empowered to lead adaptation planning and implementation.

What do you see as the main challenges facing the Adaptation Fund that are yet to be overcome?

Achieving predictable, sustainable and consistent funding from a variety of sources to meet the growing global adaptation needs we are facing, particularly among the most vulnerable. Meeting the climate challenge will require greater volumes of adaptation finance and a more strategic approach to investment. We hope that this COP gives strong signals to that effect and ensures adequate resources to the Adaptation Fund in the coming years.

At IPCC-61 held between July-August, some Global South countries like Kenya, Algeria and India raised concerns about the term "maladaptation". They said it is "mitigation-centric" given that the definition in IPCC's AR6 report includes a constraint on emissions. This would be a problem because many adaptation measures like building cyclone shelters, for example, requires some room for emissions. Other experts also say that the assumption of perfect foresight in being able to assess what is and isn't maladaptation is problematic. What are your thoughts on maladaptation?

In adaptation projects it's important to screen for maladaptation but by that we primarily mean adaptation strategies or measures that can actually make people or communities even more vulnerable to climate change than they were before. Each adaptation project is different and we need to understand the local context, and this is why our thorough stakeholder engagement process and monitoring and evaluation as well as the Adaptation Fund network of civil society organisations help ensure our projects are effective and delivered to the vulnerable.

Has the Adaptation Fund classified any project or any part of any project as "maladaptation"? If yes, could you provide a number on how many there are and what the nature of such projects is?

Our thorough technical review process screens for risks of maladaptation and asks detailed questions to ensure that the project deploys the most effective measures for the context and ones that are sustainable in the long term. For example, if a project that attempts to manage droughts proposes tapping into aquifers, it is important to understand the replenishment of the aquifer to ensure that the water provision will be sustainable and that we are not increasing dependency on a source of water that may be depleted quickly.

In adaptation literature, irrigation is often classified as "maladaptation". But irrigation has played in securing farmer livelihoods, especially in poorer, agriculture-dependent countries. Your views on this?

Adaptation measures are targeted to the local adaptation needs and vary per country and situation. In drought-prone areas, water security is paramount and measures such as rooftop water harvesting, drip irrigation and downhill water filtration systems, just as a few examples, have shown to be quite effective.

HD 	COP16 - Nigeria, Global South Countries Makes Case for International Nature Finance Support

The 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD),which recently ended in Cali, Colombia was aimed at providing equity and addressing socio-economic aspects of our ecological crisis.

The UNEP Executive Director, Inger Andersen during the opening, said the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) is the boldest plan to make peace with nature.

TD 
	

"A plan that, as we implement and interweave it with the Climate Convention, the Desertification Convention, and the Pollution conventions, can truly address that which we refer to as the triple planetary crisis, the crisis of climate change, the crisis of nature, biodiversity and land loss, and the crisis of pollution and waste," she said.

Andersen explained that the GBF's sweeping vision is reflected in 23 clear targets; many of which are quantifiable and measurable, adding that 115 parties have submitted over 2,645 national targets.

"And we need to support countries to ensure that these plans are ambitious, achievable, and approved at a high political level to secure a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach," she said.

"Of course, strong funding will be essential for implementation at national and regional level. The GBF calls for a significant step up in both public and private funding alongside a dramatic dialing down of harmful incentives and subsidies. The Global Biodiversity Framework Fund is already supporting investments, but it remains under-capitalised. We need urgent contributions from public resources. And we need to see a dramatic increase in private and innovative sources," she said.

She further said: "Justice, equity and inclusion will be foundational to the GBF's success. So, it is long past time for the leadership and knowledge of Indigenous Peoples to take front and centre. In the same vein, COP16 must operationalize the mechanism and fund for fair and equitable benefit-sharing from Digital Sequencing Information of genetic resources. That is how the GBF can ensure that those who profit from biodiversity give back to nature, to countries and to communities that steward our natural heritage.

However, the global meeting has continued to leave much to be desired by developing countries who contribute so little to the climate crisis but are at the receiving end of the impact.

The COP has agreed that a certain amount should be used to finance the Global Biodiversity Framework but there seem to be severe shortfalls in the funding of environmental protection, including biodiversity and others.

The Nigeria Minister of State for Environment who chaired the Ministerial Alliance For Ambition on Nature Finance (MAANF) at the margin of COP 16, Dr. Iziaq Salako said finance is the most important issue in implementing biodiversity framework.

He said: "Target 19 (a) of the Global Biodiversity Framework provides that least $20 billion in international biodiversity finance will be directed annually to developing countries by 2025, and $30 billion by 2030. This commitment is the result of extensive negotiations and must be kept in full by the agreed deadline or we will fail in our efforts to achieve the goals we have set in the GBF."

Dr. Salako said since COP15, they have not seen a significant increase in international nature finance supporting projects in Nigeria and global South countries.

"While Nigeria government is committed to increasing biodiversity finance, to truly activate more national finance and improve our ability to help achieve our ambitious goals for restoring and conserving the natural world, this cannot replace or supersede the funds pledged through the adoption of target 19 (a), " he said.

"We are releasing a Ministerial Declaration endorsed by 20 countries from the Global South to call on developed countries to urgently increase their international finance commitments and to develop a roadmap and accountability mechanisms to ensure that the $20 billion commitment to developing countries will be delivered on time."

While noting that it is a call to action and an offer to work together to increase accountability and transparency, he said "Let us be united on the road to ambition - let us work hand in hand to ensure we reach our common goal of fully implementing the Kunming Montreal Biodiversity Framework."

Salako said during the COP15 negotiations, the $20 billion target was generally understood as a doubling of the existing level of funding, saying, "We have learned since then that the level of international nature finance at the time of the COP15 negotiations was actually $15.4 billion. This means that delivering $20 billion is not a doubling of the baseline, it is only a 30per cent increase, which is very modest. We therefore invite our partners in the Global North to go beyond the bare minimum and to endeavor to go far above the $20 billion by 2025 pledge."

HD 	Big Companies Profit From Poverty but Aren't Obliged to Uphold Human Rights. International Law Must Change - Scholar

There is some disagreement among legal practitioners and scholars about whether corporations have duties under international law.

Many argue that only states are bound by international law, and it is those states which are obliged to regulate how businesses operate within their borders. Corporations have only a voluntary responsibility to avoid committing human rights violations through their operations.

TD 
	

I have been doing research in the area of corporate accountability for human rights violations since 2006. My most recent paper looks at the role of multinational corporations (multinationals) in benefiting from and perpetuating structural poverty in the global south.

I argue that international law can no longer exempt corporations from liability for human rights violations, including those arising from poverty. Under certain circumstances, corporations should have duties under international law to ensure human rights are fulfilled. I argue that this is particularly true when it comes to socio-economic rights such as the rights to housing, education, food, water and healthcare.

International human rights law must be developed to impose duties directly on multinational corporations to alleviate poverty in the developing countries where they operate.

This is not an absolute duty - it would only arise in certain circumstances and for specific periods of time, as I show in my paper.

Poverty and corporations

Some estimate that as many as 1.3 billion people live in poverty - more than 10% of the world's population, the vast majority in the global south.

Poverty is also deadly. It is estimated that at least 21,300 people die every day as a result of poverty and inequality. Poverty is a human rights violation, affecting the rights to dignity, life, food and water.

Businesses have a long history of profiting from human rights abuses. Finance and transport companies have acknowledged ties to the slave trade. European banks reportedly assisted South Africa's apartheid government to procure arms.

Even when they are not directly responsible for human rights violations, multinational corporations may be complicit. Multinationals based in the global north tend to exploit developing countries for their cheap labour, natural resources and weak regulatory frameworks. In other words, corporations benefit from poverty.

International law

In 2005, Professor John Ruggie was appointed as the United Nations secretary-general's special representative on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. He developed the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This framework adopts the position that only states are subjects and have duties under international human rights law.

The UN guiding principles are organised around three pillars, known as Protect, Respect and Remedy. The first pillar relates to states' obligations to uphold human rights. It includes the duty to regulate businesses to ensure they do not violate rights through their operations. The second pillar refers to corporations' responsibility to respect human rights. This is voluntary and not a legal obligation. The third pillar ensures that victims of human rights violations have access to effective remedies.

This framework relies on three factors: states which have the interests of their citizens at heart, corporations complying with human rights standards, and effective remedial systems. If all three work together, then the UN guiding principles can address corporate accountability for rights violations.

In practice, however, this is not the case. Many states, particularly those in the developing world with high levels of poverty, rely on foreign investment. This creates a power imbalance when negotiating with large multinational corporations. Multinationals are able to demand favourable investment conditions, including relaxing laws that might protect human rights.

Under the UN guiding principles, if states do not impose obligations on corporations to comply with human rights, they do not have such obligations.

Next steps

Not all corporations should have the same duties as states. I propose a set of factors that would determine when a corporation might have a duty under international human rights law to fulfil socio-economic rights. These factors are:

*liiitag the extent of the violation

*liiitag the position or vulnerability of the victim

*liiitag the urgency of the situation

*liiitag whether the corporation is the only actor that can fulfil the right.

For example, let us imagine a scenario in which a company operates a mine in the Central African Republic. It has built a hospital for its workers and management. Surrounding the mining operations are indigent communities who resided in the area before the operations began.

One day, a child from one of the settlements is knocked over by a car. Her injuries are not life-threatening, but they are severe and the child is in terrible pain. The closest hospital is the mine-owned private hospital. There is a public hospital, but it is far away and travelling there would take time and be costly. The child's family rushes her to the mine's hospital for emergency treatment. Does the hospital have a legal duty to admit the child and pay for her treatment?

Applying a combination of the factors, the answer is yes. The child is vulnerable by virtue of her age and poverty, the situation is urgent, and the mine hospital is the only entity that can fulfil the right under the circumstances.

Using this framework, I argue that international human rights law should be developed to mitigate the harm of poverty in the global south, by imposing duties on corporations that benefit from poverty. Some corporations have a perverse incentive to keep communities poor. International law has a role to play in overturning this state of affairs.

Ultimately, my proposal seeks to review what we think of as a fair and just economy. Nothing will change if only states have obligations under international law. The global economic market is neither free nor fair. It has created the most severe human rights violations of our age. International human rights law must address this.

HD 	India and China Vie for Leadership of the Global South

Which of the two countries is better placed to champion Africa's developmental aspirations?

The rivalry between China and India, both BRICS members, extends to their bid to lead the global south. As Western dominance wanes, both Beijing and New Delhi are advancing distinct yet globally influential agendas, each leveraging unique strengths that shape global alliances and institutions.

TD 
	

For African nations, where development and decision-making sovereignty are key, the choice between China and India as global south leaders is significant. Each offers advantages and challenges with implications for Africa's future. Although neither has officially declared a bid for this leadership, their actions and statements signal intent.

India's role in pushing for south-south cooperation at forums like the G20, and advocating for more equitable representation in global governance, align with its leadership vision. China's assertive diplomacy, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and its increasing investments in African and Latin American infrastructure projects, highlights a claim to leadership rooted in economic influence.

The rivalry is stoked by narratives in each country's foreign policy community and think tanks, which see India's democratic alignment and China's developmental success as competing models for the global south. Officially, both countries underscore their solidarity with developing nations but avoid overt declarations of competition, instead positioning their respective approaches as solutions to developing countries' needs.

India, as the world's largest democracy, resonates strongly in Africa, where democratic governance is often seen as a path to stability and growth. India's commitment to democratic values and its policy of non-interference align well with Africa's emphasis on political sovereignty and diversity.

Many African nations also share historical ties with India, rooted in the Non-Aligned Movement and anti-colonial solidarity, which reinforce India's appeal as a trusted partner. This is further strengthened by the influential role of the Indian diaspora in Africa.

India's development approach centres on human capital and technology transfer, often through private sector initiatives. This model, focused on skills building, matches Africa's need for sustainable, locally adaptable solutions.

India's experiences with its own diverse population enable it to respond effectively to Africa's varied needs. Through public-private partnerships, India has achieved progress in healthcare, education and digital access, which could provide scalable models for African countries facing similar challenges.

On the global stage, India has played a leading role in minilateral and multilateral groupings like the Quad and G20, and by fostering ties with the United States, Europe and BRICS countries. India's role as a bridge between the global north and south has proven advantageous, as seen in its push to include the African Union in the G20.

India's assertive stance on issues like the Ukraine conflict has also resonated with African nations seeking an independent global voice.

This context has bolstered India's standing in the global south, with African countries increasingly viewing India as representing their collective interests. India's ability to balance relations with both Western and non-Western powers appeals to African nations navigating similarly complex geopolitics.

However, India's limited financial resources compared to China, pose challenges in scaling its influence across Africa. Domestic issues like poverty alleviation and infrastructure development may further limit India's capacity to prioritise Africa consistently. The lack of an India-Africa Forum Summit since 2015 also raises questions about India's long-term commitment.

China's economic might makes it a compelling global south leader, especially through its infrastructure projects that meet urgent needs. Africa's vast infrastructure deficit - in transport, energy and telecommunications - finds an eager partner in China's BRI, which has made a visible impact across the continent. BRI projects help African economies integrate with global trade routes, enhancing export potential and fostering regional connections.

China's achievements in poverty reduction - viewed by many African countries as a model for economic transformation - add to its appeal. China's stance on non-interference aligns with African leaders' preference for sovereignty, and African countries wary of Western conditionalities often find China's approach refreshing.

Further, China's creation of alternative global institutions - such as the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative - presents African nations with options beyond Western-led frameworks, appealing to those who seek diverse partnerships.

China's technological prowess, particularly in 5G, digital payments and artificial intelligence, offers transformative potential for African economies. The country's involvement in telecommunications provides affordable digital infrastructure necessary for economic development.

However, China's authoritarian government raises concerns among Africa's democratic nations, and financial dependency on China has cast a shadow on its image. Transparency issues, contentious labour practices, and the environmental impacts of large-scale projects have also sparked criticism. These factors lead some African leaders to question whether China's transactional approach aligns with their long-term goals.

China's reputation is also affected by controversies around COVID-19, espionage allegations and assertive foreign policies, potentially diminishing its appeal as a global south leader.

Some argue that China's inclusion in the global south is convenient but contrived, compromising its leadership credibility. Critics point to China's high GDP, robust trade, investments and military power, which align more with great power status than the global south. Beijing, however, maintains that solidarity with developing countries is the foundation of its foreign relations.

For Africa, the choice between China and India as global south leaders depends on the continent's priorities and values. India's democratic credentials, development model and trust-based partnerships are appealing, as is its growing role as a bridge-builder between north and south, especially among African countries seeking sovereignty in their partnerships.

Conversely, China's financial strength, rapid infrastructure development, and non-interference approach make it a vital partner, particularly for nations facing immediate development needs. Yet concerns about debt sustainability and China's authoritative approach limit its appeal as a long-term leader.

Ultimately, the choice need not be one or the other - both offer complementary roles that African countries can strategically leverage.

China's strength in large-scale infrastructure and financial investment provides immediate, transformative support. Meanwhile, India's focus on capacity building, technology transfer, and democratic governance offers a pathway to sustainable, locally adaptable long-term growth.

The recent rapprochement between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit could be a positive sign - though analysts remain sceptical given the substantive tensions. A more cooperative relationship could allow BRICS to consistently support Africa, addressing infrastructure and human capital development while promoting a more cohesive global south.

By engaging with both China and India, Africa can build a balanced, diversified approach to development that minimises dependency on a single partner. This dual engagement allows African nations to draw on China's resources to meet urgent infrastructure needs while benefitting from India's people-centred initiatives that foster skills and independence.

In doing so, Africa can assert its agency on the global stage, using the strengths of both to advance its interests.

As stakeholders reconvene in Geneva for the 12th session of the Pandemic Agreement, AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) has advised on the Global South to carefully analyse the discussions if they are to benefit from the meetings.

The meeting will be held from November 4 to November 15 to fine tune the Pandemic Agreement.

TD 
	

The Pandemic Agreement is a potential international agreement currently being negotiated by the 194 member states of the World Health Organisation.

Many governments and WHO leadership felt it was necessary to develop a new agreement to address some of the weaknesses in capacities and lack of international cooperation that occurred during the global response to Covid-19.

In a telephone interview, the AHF country programme manager, Dr Enerst Chikwati called on the Global South to carefully examine the Pandemic Agreement negotiations which have stretched to three years.

"After the ravaging effects of Covid-19, the agreed time frame was one year.

"Considering the subtle implications and potential consequences of specific provisions, such as technology transfer, financing, and accountability, there is need to identify subtle or hidden messages, intentions, or consequences that may not be immediately apparent.

"The Global South ought to analyse beyond the surface-level or literal meaning and consider the context, tone, and attention to detail to uncover the underlying truth, nuances, or further implications.

"We must ensure enforceable provisions for the transfer of technology and know-how, without restrictive terms like 'voluntary' or 'mutually agreed terms," he said.

These qualifiers can disadvantage low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by limiting their ability to access essential technologies needed to produce vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

Dr Chikwati said binding commitments for tech transfer were crucial components to establishing regional production capacity in the Global South.

The Global South should strongly oppose any language that restricts a country's ability to implement non voluntary measures -- such as compulsory licensing -- to address public health emergencies.

High income countries frequently use these measures and including limitations would create a double standard.

The use of "mutually agreed terms" and qualifiers that define Technology Transfer solely as "voluntary" measures could disadvantage low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that may need to implement non-voluntary measures to address public health crises.

Non-voluntary measures, which can include compulsory licenses and other regulatory actions, are legally permitted and frequently used in high-income countries - including the United States.

These are also the subject of new legislation at the level of the European Union.

These terms can create double standards where high-income countries can employ non-voluntary measures while restricting low and medium income countries to voluntary means or mutually agreed terms for technology transfer.

Insight into PABS

What is PABS?

The WHO Pathogen Access and Benefits Sharing (PABS) system, currently being negotiated under Article 12 of the agreement, is designed to ensure that manufacturers of pandemic-related health products receive timely access to pathogen samples and genomic sequences from Member States.

In return, these manufacturers are required to share certain benefits derived from the use of this information to develop their products.

This is important because a percentage of benefits must be negotiated so that low and medium income countries- particularly those that lack production capacity - can have immediate access to vaccines, diagnostics, and other lifesaving counter measures.

Stakeholders must oppose delaying substantive discussions on PABS by leaving it for a separate protocol that may not be finalised for years. Fundamental aspects of the PABS system must be agreed upon now to ensure timely and equitable access to life-saving countermeasures for low- and middle-income countries without delay.

Fundamental aspects of PABS need to be agreed on now. Delaying the conclusion of negotiations around PABS not only leaves low to middle income countries at risk but also runs the risk of indefinitely dragging out discussion at a loss of LMIC bargaining power.

Insist on Equitable Benefit-Sharing Percentages: Reject the inadequate 5-20 percent range and advocate for a fairer distribution, such as 50/50, to ensure LMICs have sufficient access to essential health products.

Dr Chikwati urged countries to incorporate community-led-monitoring.

"With pandemics mostly tackled from a clinical point of view, Community-Led Monitoring (CLM) proved crucial in Zimbabwe from previous pandemics, the HIV pandemic to Covid-19. Civil society organisations led to ownership and accountability with specific solutions for enhanced responsiveness to local needs. Empowerment of local leaders and stakeholders led to better coordination and collaboration among stakeholders, resulting in more effective use of resources," said Dr Chikwati.

With commitment from the highest office, President Mnangagwa appointed Dr Agnes Mahomva as Public Health Advisor to the President and Cabinet.

The office is meant to strengthen public health promotion and enhancing the country's response to emergencies.

"Dr Mahomva will advise on evidence-based decision-making and coordination between ministries, departments, agencies, communities, and the private sector," said Dr Chikwati.

Health systems are always in need of strengthening at country to global level.

As the pandemic preparedness negotiations currently stand, they are not giving even half the loaf.

The high income countries seek to repeat the Covid-19 era, which was an error, where they stocked vaccines while the low and middle income countries waited for crumbs.

Taking the same route would now be an error of choice by those who have. It is unacceptable.

A repeat of 2020 would reveal that the world learnt nothing from the effects of a recent devastating Covid-19 pandemic.

Ushering in a multipolar order requires a streamlined and coherent political agenda - not unfocused expansion.

The 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, concluded last week with the usual grand declaration of the group's commitments, concerns and aspirations.

TD 
	

Many media headlines, particularly in Western countries, focused on how the summit and BRICS generally, symbolised Moscow's ability to circumvent the fallout of sanctions by turning to the global south. In this way, BRICS is indirectly viewed as a threat to Western efforts to isolate Russia, weaken its power projection capabilities, and end its invasion of Ukraine.

Western governments and analysts often struggle to frame BRICS's evolution beyond a binary, zero-sum narrative in which the group is a key geopolitical challenge to the Western-dominated international order. This interpretation places the forces of democracy and liberal political values in one camp and authoritarian governments in another, with certain developing countries caught in the middle, trying to play one side off the other for their own benefit.

There is some merit to these kinds of headlines. Russia and China are primarily major status-quo powers. Both have been permanent United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members since its establishment. Moscow was the 'other pole' in the international order for most of the 20th century, a position Beijing is working towards. And the foreign policy goals of both place them in confrontation with the United States and its Western allies.

So, are these two countries in a position to champion the global south's cause, and why haven't more representative bodies like the Non-Aligned Movement played a more prominent role?

The preoccupation with Russia and China detracts from BRICS's broader, underlying geopolitical project - the need for global south countries to reform and shape the international order's future direction on their own terms.

These include greater representation and agency in global policy- and decision-making bodies and facilitating greater freedom to trade, invest and borrow money outside the Western-dominated financial system. They also include a more just and equitable global power balance that reflects modern realities.

In pursuing these aims, BRICS countries have made steady progress on developing a shared strategic agenda for increased cooperation across various policy domains.

The Kazan summit's 32-page outcomes declaration covers almost everything from reforming the UNSC and Bretton Woods institutions to climate change, biodiversity and conservation. It also covers challenges from global crises, conflicts and terrorism and a suite of economic development, health, education, science and cultural exchange-related issues.

The group's ballooning cooperation agenda may indicate progress. But it could also signify the limits of its diverse members' ability to agree on 'hard' political and security matters central to the core business of reforming the international order.

The expansion of BRICS' substantive agenda and its membership dilutes its primary purpose and reinforces the binary, zero-sum Western narrative its members constantly try to shed.

Tangible, albeit gradual, progress on establishing intra-BRICS institutions and processes such as the Interbank Cooperation Mechanism, the cross-border payment system and its independent reinsurance capacity suggest that BRICS' clout and credibility are growing.

These initiatives could enable members to pursue their international economic objectives without the constraints and transactional costs associated with traditional financial bodies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Ideally, this would improve their relative positions of global power and influence, and help deliver a more multipolar international order.

In contrast, deepening cooperation on big cat conservation, while important, doesn't serve that purpose. Nor does facilitating youth exchanges on sports and healthy lifestyles or championing a BRICS alliance for folk dance. Including these kinds of initiatives in BRICS' growing agenda detracts from its core objectives.

More worryingly, this suggests that BRICS' diverse constellation of member states is pursuing the path of least resistance - expanding their cooperation in every direction, hoping something eventually sticks.

Instead of doubling down on hard strategic questions about a shared conception of multipolarity, and the steps necessary to reform global governance and security institutions, BRICS seems to be heading for greater expansion and formalisation. And with that come the risks, challenges and institutional dependencies that have led to the stagnation and ineffectiveness plaguing more established international organisations in recent years.

Perhaps the group's core members recognise that they have very different ideas of what constitutes multipolarity. Russia (and China to an extent) envisage much more than global institutional reforms, focusing instead on reimagining international norms and core principles.

These differences are also reflected in BRICS' expanding membership. It seems Russian and Chinese enthusiasm has been curbed by other founding members, who prefer a 'partner country' model for future growth. This contrasts with the full membership offers to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and UAE in 2023. (Argentina's new political administration declined, and the Saudis have remained non-committal.

Most worrying, however, is BRICS' preoccupation with promoting democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms. There is no doubt that these terms are increasingly politicised and rife with double standards - among developing nations with mixed political systems and traditionally liberal, Western democracies. However, for BRICS to meaningfully champion normative values, its members must at least attempt to commit to common political governance systems in their own countries.

Having a group of partner nations composed of progressive constitutional democracies and closed repressive autocracies and theocracies attempting to speak with one voice on promoting human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms is absurd. It reeks of empty political rhetoric at best, and Orwellian double-speak at worst.

This again dilutes BRICS' key messages, undermines its important core business, and detracts from the significant progress being made towards a common strategic agenda.

BRICS primary goal moving forward should be to trim the fat.

A streamlined annual working agenda would divert attention away from its individual member states' contradictions and geopolitical manoeuvring. With a focus on addressing the international system's failures, institutional reform and greater representation for global south countries in policy- and decision-making bodies could be prioritised.

This seems unlikely though, if this year's summit is anything to go by. By following the path of least resistance, BRICS may be setting itself on a course towards increasing and unnecessary substantive bloat, and away from its core business.

Only time will tell if certain members are willing to be more assertive and correct course before they are too far down a path impossible to pivot away from.

HD 	BRICS+ Could Shape a New World Order, but It Lacks Shared Values and a Unified Identity

The last two summits of Brics countries have raised questions about the coalition's identity and purpose. This began to come into focus at the summit hosted by South Africa in 2023, and more acutely at the recent 2024 summit in Kazan, Russia.

TD 
	

At both events the alliance undertook to expand its membership. In 2023, the first five Brics members - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - invited Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join. All bar Saudi Arabia have now done so. The 2024 summit pledged to admit 13 more, perhaps as associates or "partner countries".

On paper, the nine-member Brics+ strikes a powerful pose. It has a combined population of about 3.5 billion, or 45% of the world's people. Combined, its economies are worth more than US$28.5 trillion - about 28% of the global economy. With Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE as members, Brics+ produces about 44% of the world's crude oil.

Based on my research and policy advice to African foreign policy decision-makers, I would argue that there are three possible interpretations of the purpose of Brics+.

*liiitag A club of self-interested members - a kind of global south cooperative. What I'd label as a self-help organisation.

*liiitag A reforming bloc with a more ambitious goal of improving the workings of the current global order.

*liiitag A disrupter, preparing to replace the western-dominated liberal world order.

Analysing the commitments that were made at the meeting in Russia, I would argue that Brics+ sees itself more as a self-interested reformer. It represents the thinking among global south leaders about the nature of global order, and the possibilities of shaping a new order. This, as the world moves away from the financially dominant, yet declining western order (in terms of moral influence) led by the US. The move is to a multipolar order in which the east plays a leading role.

However, the ability of Brics+ to exploit such possibilities is constrained by its make-up and internal inconsistencies. These include a contested identity, incongruous values and lack of resources to convert political commitments into actionable plans.

Summit outcomes

The trend towards closer trade and financial cooperation and coordination stands out as a major achievement of the Kazan summit. Other achievements pertain to global governance and counter-terrorism.

When it comes to trade and finance, the final communiqué said the following had been agreed:

*liiitag adoption of local currencies in trade and financial transactions. The Kazan Declaration notes the benefits of faster, low cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments. The guiding principle would be minimal trade barriers and non-discriminatory access.

*liiitag establishment of a cross-border payment system. The declaration encourages correspondent banking networks within Brics, and enabling settlements in local currencies in line with the Brics Cross-Border Payments Initiative. This is voluntary and nonbinding and is to be discussed further.

*liiitag creation of an enhanced roles for the New Development Bank, such as promoting infrastructure and sustainable development.

*liiitag a proposed Brics Grain Exchange, to improve food security through enhanced trade in agricultural commodities.

All nine Brics+ countries committed themselves to the principles of the UN Charter - peace and security, human rights, the rule of law, and development - primarily as a response to the western unilateral sanctions.

The summit emphasised that dialogue and diplomacy should prevail over conflict in, among other places, the Middle East, Sudan, Haiti and Afghanistan.

Faultlines and tensions

Despite the positive tone of the Kazan declaration, there are serious structural fault lines and tensions inherent in the architecture and behaviour of Brics+. These might limit its ambitions to be a meaningful change agent.

The members don't even agree on the definition of Brics+. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa calls it a platform. Others talk of a group (Russia's President Vladimir Putin, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi) or a family (Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jianan).

So what could it be?

Brics+ is state-driven - with civil society on the margins. It reminds one of the African Union, which pays lip service to citizens' engagement in decision-making.

One possibility is that it will evolve into an intergovernmental organisation with a constitution that sets up its agencies, functions and purposes. Examples include the World Health Organization, the African Development Bank and the UN general assembly.

But it would need to cohere around shared values. What would they be?

Critics point out that Brics+ consists of democracies (South Africa, Brazil, India), a theocracy (Iran), monarchies (UAE, Saudi Arabia) and authoritarian dictatorships (China, Russia). For South Africa this creates a domestic headache. At the Kazan summit, its president declared Russia a friend and ally. At home, its coalition partner in the government of national unity, the Democratic Alliance, declared Ukraine as a friend and ally.

There are also marked differences over issues such as the reform of the United Nations. For example, at the recent UN Summit of the Future the consensus was for reform of the UN security council. But will China and Russia, as permanent security council members, agree to more seats, with veto rights, on the council?

As for violent conflict, humanitarian crises, corruption and crime, there is little from the Kazan summit that suggests agreement around action.

Unity of purpose

What about shared interests? A number of Brics+ members and the partner countries maintain close trade ties with the west, which regards Russia and Iran as enemies and China as a global threat.

Some, such as India and South Africa, use the foreign policy notions of strategic ambiguity or active non-alignment to mask the reality of trading with east, west, north and south.

The harsh truth of international relations is there are no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests. The Brics+ alliance will most likely cohere as a global south co-operative, with an innovative self-help agenda, but be reluctant to overturn the current global order from which it desires to benefit more equitably.

Trade-offs and compromises might be necessary to ensure "unity of purpose". It's not clear that this loose alliance is close to being able to achieve that.

HD 	Scientific Research Can Play a Key Role in Unlocking Climate Finance

Climate finance will come under intense scrutiny during COP29, and its distribution aligned with scientific analysis of the impacts of climate change, but the methodology ignores the inequality in research networks of the Global South.

CARACAS, Oct 29 2024 (IPS) - Climate finance will be at the epicenter of the discussion at the UN Climate Change Conference 2024 (COP29). The focus will be on strengthening the fund and defining the conditions under which the countries of the Global South will be able to access this money. However, little is said about the scientific research that is required to gather the evidence and data to prove the loss and damage caused by the impact of climate change in developing countries.

TD 
	

One of the points under discussion is the need for countries of the Global South to provide comprehensive, scientifically backed reports on how they are being directly affected by the impacts of climate change. This requirement guarantees that money will flow to the most affected countries, but it ignores the inequality present in scientific research networks in the Global South.

Floods and the effects of storms or hurricanes are not the only topics we are discussing. For example, will Latin American countries, such as Brazil or Argentina, be ready to provide data and evidence of how global warming precipitated an increase in dengue cases among their citizens in 2024?

Dengue cases in Latin America tripled compared to the same period in 2023. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) compiled reports of more than 12 million cases of dengue fever in the region up to middle October and, undoubtedly, this additional health burden is part of the less talked about impacts of climate change.

Research centers in Brazil or Argentina, two of the countries with the best scientific networks in the region, can surely deliver the studies to support a financial request to cover these health-related damages. But the scenario is very different if we look at the scientific networks of other Latin American countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, or my native Venezuela.

More than 3,000 Venezuelan scientists have left the country for lack of support and financial problems in its laboratories since 2009, according to the follow-up done by researcher Jaime Requena, a member of the Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences (Acfiman, its acronym in Spanish). This is equivalent to half of the Venezuelan scientific force, considering that Venezuela had 6,831 active researchers in the Researcher Promotion Program (PPI) in 2009.

Only 11 Venezuelan scientists participated as authors in all the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In AR6, the most recent IPCC report, only three authors were Venezuelan.

Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay were also represented by three researchers in AR6, while other countries such as Paraguay and Bolivia did not even manage to add a scientist to the group of more than 700 authors.

Climatologist Paola Andrea Arias was part of the Colombian representation. She is one of those promoting that the IPCC broaden the diversity of authors in the next report on the effects of climate change in the world.

"We all do science with different perspectives; we will follow the same methods and the same standards, but we have different perspectives. We ask different questions and have different priorities. We see in science the possibility of answering or solving different problems and, obviously, that will be very focused on your reality, the world in which you live, the country or city where you are," said Arias when I asked her about her participation in AR6.

The low participation of Latin American scientists in global research on climate change, such as that of the IPCC, also means less space and dissemination for those studies that try to track the impacts of climate change in the region. This pattern is also repeated in Africa and Asia.

Promoting more research on the damages and impacts of climate change in the Global South, in the end, is not something that can be separated from climate finance. A clear example is that the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) has just created a scientific committee for its biodiversity conservation fund, as announced during COP16 on biodiversity in Cali, Colombia.

CAF explained that this new biodiversity committee will have "a key role" with recommendations based on scientific evidence to invest in environmental projects. The first tasks of this scientific committee will be focused on providing recommendations for conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of ecosystems in the Amazon, Cerrado, and Chocó, a program that will have access to 300 million dollars.

The creation of a scientific committee to deliver climate finance can be a first step, as shown by CAF's experience in biodiversity. To move forward on this path, however, it is necessary to promote more funding for Latin American, African, and Asian scientists to do more local research on the impacts of climate change. It's the only way to gather the scientific evidence to support the contention that the climate crisis represents an obstacle to development in those countries with the largest populations and the greatest number of disadvantages.

HD 	The IMF Just Made the Case for Its Own Irrelevance

On Friday the 11th, the IMF announced policy changes that will save developing countries $1.2 billion per year. Despite the self-congratulations and fanfare, these reforms are only a tiny fraction of what campaigners had been asking for -- and an even smaller share of what the Global South needs.

This month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had an opportunity to end one of its most reviled policies and lift billions of dollars of debt off the backs of crisis-stricken developing countries. It chose not to.

TD 
	

The IMF's ostensible mission is to promote financial stability by providing loans to countries facing economic challenges or crises. These loans must be repaid, with interest, and typically come with harmful conditions of austerity, privatization, and deregulation.

Since 1997, the IMF has also levied fees called surcharges, on top of the regular costs of a loan, on countries whose debt to the Fund exceeds a certain threshold. By the IMF's logic, these highly indebted countries -- like Pakistan, which is still recovering from unprecedented natural disasters, and Ukraine, which is in the midst of a war -- surcharges provide an incentive to deter prolonged reliance on the Fund.

In reality, surcharges exacerbate already onerous debt burdens, siphoning scarce resources from countries in need of relief rather than punishment. As a result of the pandemic, the global economic shocks sparked by the war in Ukraine, climate change, and rising interest rates -- circumstances well beyond any individual country's control -- the number of countries forced to pay surcharges to the IMF has nearly tripled in the past five years. Clearly, surcharges do not work as claimed.

As the burden of surcharges has grown, so has their opposition. In recent years, researchers have uncovered the profound harms caused by the policy, members of Congress have passed legislation demanding their reassessment, and civil society groups have organized discussions and letters pushing for their elimination.

Ultimately, a clear global majority -- including every developing country, leading economists, UN human rights experts, and hundreds of organizations like Oxfam and the International Trade Union Confederation -- stood on the side of discontinuing the policy.

Given this near-consensus, the policy's clear harms, the fact that the IMF has no need for surcharge income, and the historical precedence for their elimination, many assumed that ending surcharges was a low-hanging fruit. Following years of pressure, the IMF initiated a formal review of surcharges this summer.

The outcome of that review, announced last week, provided a welcome measure of relief, but ultimately fell short. Rather than ending the counterproductive policy, the Fund raised the threshold at which surcharges must be paid, and slightly reduced their charge. The Fund also decreased its current non-surcharge lending rate from 4.51 percent to 4.11.

Because of the increased threshold, fewer countries will pay surcharges, though the number could still grow significantly in the coming years, as climate disasters and other external shocks force more countries to take on higher levels of IMF debt.

By the Fund's measurements, these changes will reduce the costs paid by all borrowers, combined, by $1.2 billion annually. While this is better than what would have occurred without concerted external efforts, the Fund has ultimately doubled down on its procyclical logic while conceding only enough to alleviate pressure.

Inside reports indicate that the United States, which has the largest vote under the Fund's undemocratic governance structure, was the primary blocker of more substantive reform, proposing instead to use the income from surcharges to cover for wealthy countries' own funding shortfalls.

For many highly indebted countries, including Ecuador, Argentina, Ukraine, Egypt, and Pakistan, the failure to discontinue surcharges means a multi-billion dollar bill will soon come due, making it harder to reduce debts to sustainable levels or to finance development, climate action, and other critical needs.

This, in turn, adds fuel to the fire of an already vicious cycle of debt, underdevelopment, and climate change; nearly 80 developing countries are already in or at risk of debt distress, three quarters of which are highly climate vulnerable.

This is hardly the first time the IMF has imperiled the Global South. The IMF is perhaps best known for its role during the debt crises of the 1980s and 1990s, in which emergency loans were used to force developing countries to adopt neoliberalizing reforms that resulted in lost decades of economic growth.

In response to these evident harms, mounting global protests, and decreasing reliance on Fund lending, the IMF in the 2000s began to adopt better rhetoric, established new fora for civil society participation, and eventually even owned up to many of its failures. But while these cosmetic changes defused opposition, the Fund did not fundamentally alter its approach.

Since the 2008 financial crisis, and accelerating during the pandemic, developing countries have once again been forced to accumulate a powder keg of debt. The IMF's response has not only been insufficient, but, in the case of surcharges and the continued insistence on austerity, actively harmful. Meanwhile, attempts to democratize the IMF's governance structure and give greater voice to countries of the Global South have repeatedly faltered.

But while the IMF long ago revealed its true face, developing countries have had nowhere else to turn. In today's increasingly multipolar world, that may soon change. China's emergence as the world's largest bilateral creditor, the establishment of the BRICS+'s New Development Bank and Contingent Reserve Agreement, efforts to build alternatives to the US dollar and its attendant monetary constraints -- countries across the Global South are seeking to reduce dependence on the IMF.

While these alternatives remain nascent, the fact that the Fund has proven unresponsive to even the simplest of reforms should only hasten this process.

Civil society groups, meanwhile, who hoped that directly engaging with the IMF would lead to substantive change, may yet become disillusioned. If all this time, resources, and energy could not even end surcharges, perhaps the prospects of "change from within" should be abandoned -- and the era of mass protest from outside the security perimeter, revitalized.

Discontinuing surcharges alone would not have solved the many crises facing the Global South. But the failure to do so has made clear that the solutions do not lie within the IMF. When even the low-hanging fruit is out of reach, perhaps all that is left is to strike at the root.

The financial institutions' current approaches to funding renewable energy projects are far too limited, rigid, and opaque.

As ministers around the world gear up for annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group (WBG), on 21-26 October in Washington DC, climate will be high on the agenda again. Many discussions will centre on climate finance, while the World Bank is set to replace its Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) and implement a new Corporate Scorecard.

TD 
	

But are the IMF and World Bank fit for purpose to drive climate action and a renewable energy transition? The numbers suggest not yet at least. Despite the goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030, the World Bank's investments in clean energy have increased by a meagre 26% since the 2015 Paris Agreement. These shortfalls leave developing countries more likely to end up locked in long-term fossil fuel dependence, delaying the transition to renewables and exacerbating environmental degradation.

What is going wrong? And what can be done?

Gaps in renewable energy financing

Despites making some strides in supporting renewable energy, there are several gaps that continue to hinder the IMF and World Bank's effectiveness in driving a just energy transition.

1) A lack of dedicated funding for renewable energy projects

Though both institutions have programmes supporting clean energy, their overall financing is still heavily skewed toward fossil fuels. The World Bank's commitments to renewable energy remain small compared to the size of investment needed. The Group claims it increased its climate finance by 22% in its 2023 fiscal year, delivering a record of $38.6 billion, but it has not provided any clarity on how it defines climate finance, which specific projects were financed, and who benefited. In many Global South countries, lack of funding and fiscal space is an urgent obstacle to fulfilling the goal of tripling of renewable energy capacity, transitioning away from fossil fuels, and doubling energy efficiency by 2030.

2) Inflexibility in financing mechanisms

The IMF and World Bank often attach strict conditions to their loans. This not only pushes countries towards austerity and privatisation but also limits their ability to pursue projects that best suit their renewable energy potential. Traditional financing models tend to focus on larger-scale, centralised infrastructure, but these projects are often not feasible or sustainable, particularly in Africa. Meanwhile, the need for the rapid deployment of decentralised renewable energy systems, an approach that would be far more appropriate in many contexts, is overlooked.

3) Limited focus on innovation and technology transfer

To transition to renewable energy, developing countries need access to cutting-edge technologies and innovations as well as the knowledge of how to build and run them. However, the World Bank and IMF financing strategies do not prioritise technology transfer or capacity building. This leaves developing nations struggling to integrate renewable energy solutions and reliant on external firms, making long-term energy independence and sustainability harder and more costly to achieve.

4) Failure to address local contexts

The World Bank and IMF often fund large-scale, one-size-fits-all projects that do not account for local contexts. This top-down approach disregards grassroots solutions and community-led initiatives that have the potential to yield more sustainable and inclusive energy transitions. Renewable energy projects have the best chance of success when tailored to the specific needs, resources, and capacities of different regions.

Reforming the World Bank and IMF

To close these gaps and make meaningful progress toward a just energy transition, the World Bank and IMF must implement key reforms.

1) Establish a dedicated renewable energy fund

Both institutions should create new public finance institutions and transform existing ones to be more democratic, equitable, and ambitious. They should establish dedicated funds specifically for renewable energy projects that are accessible to countries and local communities without the stringent conditions that often come with conventional loans. By increasing grant-based financing, the World Bank and IMF can provide more flexible support, enabling countries to invest in a wider range of renewable projects suited to their needs.

2) Prioritise innovation and technology transfer

A key pillar of renewable energy financing should be ensuring that developing nations have access to the latest technologies and innovations. The World Bank and IMF should implement initiatives that focus on building local capacity, transferring technologies, and supporting innovation in the renewable energy space. Programmes to train local engineers and technicians, alongside partnerships with global renewable technology firms, could ensure the sustainable development of energy infrastructure in the Global South.

3) Shift focus from centralised to decentralised solutions

Developing nations, particularly in Africa, often require decentralised, off-grid, small-scale renewable energy systems like solar mini-grids and standalone wind farms. The World Bank and IMF should shift away from their traditional preference for large-scale, centralised infrastructure projects and instead invest in solutions that prioritise energy access for the most underserved populations. This could also involve microfinancing and direct support for community-owned projects that put power directly into local hands.

4) Integrate climate justice

Beyond the technical changes, the World Bank and IMF must embrace a climate justice perspective that ensures fair and equitable energy access. This means developing strategies that explicitly address the needs of marginalised communities and that ensure accountability for social and environmental impacts, with compensation and remedy where damage is done. This approach can ensure that renewable energy not only reduce reliance on fossil fuels but create jobs, reduce poverty, and empower local populations.

5) Streamline processes and foster collaboration

The World Bank and IMF should streamline their project approval processes, without compromising social and environmental assessments and accountability, to allow for quicker disbursement of funds. This would help nations deploy renewable energy faster. Additionally, fostering collaboration with regional development banks, private investors, and multilateral climate funds would help scale up financing. Collaboration can unlock additional funding streams, making renewable energy projects more feasible and attractive for developing countries.

6) Minimising damage in large-scale renewable energy investments

Renewable energy investments should prioritize energy access, community interests, and environmental preservation by focusing on concessional and grant-based financing, rather than blended finance, to support projects that might otherwise lack funding.

7) Accountability, transparency and public participation

The World Bank should disclose details of its renewable energy investments, including those made via financial intermediaries, and allow full participation of Civil Society Organisations at annual meetings. Civil society's role is to represent the voices of vulnerable people and communities, especially those that need access to affordable energy. The Group must ensure its investments are accountable to affected communities by strengthening and preserving the independence of its accountability mechanisms.

As ministers meet at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington, they must confront the shortcomings of current financing systems for renewable energy. Reforming these financial mechanisms is a matter of urgency. By shifting strategies and creating new pathways for investment, the World Bank and IMF have the potential to lead a new era of renewable energy financing - one that supports sustainable, just, and resilient energy systems in the world and especially the Global South.

HD 	Climate Change - Care for Humans, Other Species and the Natural Environment Is the Key to a Just Transition

Communities across the world are facing two worsening crises: a climate crisis and a care crisis.

The evidence and urgency on the climate crisis has been expertly illustrated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The root cause of this crisis is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is due to excessive exploitation of fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial processes. In short, it is a result of development processes that have not been based on caring for the environment.

TD 
	

Less discussed is the care crisis. This refers to a society's capacity to maintain livelihoods in households, raise children and sustain communities. In short, the care crisis is a result of not investing enough in caring for each other.

Addressing these crises requires acknowledgement of the interdependency of people, other species and the physical environment. Our failure to invest sufficiently in caring for each other, other species and our environment is a root cause of climate change. We refer to this as the "care-climate nexus". As the effects of climate change intensify, we will need to care for each other more than ever before, and we need systems to enable better care of our environment.

There is a growing discussion linking gender and climate change. However, the links between climate change and care have been largely under-researched.

The climate crisis stems, similarly to the care crisis, from an economic paradigm that undervalues care - both for each other and for our physical environment. The concept of care therefore can serve as a powerful focal point for understanding the climate challenge and for policies towards a sustainable and equitable future.

This is the gap that the "care-climate nexus" project led by the Southern Centre for Inequality studies, in collaboration with the International Development Research Centre and a group of feminist economists and climate scientists from across the world, plans to fill.

The research project has two main objectives. First, to map the conceptual links between climate change and care.

Second, to inform and support policymakers to include care in climate policy. For example, significant investments in quality care that supports climate adaptation are as important as building resilient infrastructure and can reduce the burden on those who carry out care work. Climate policy that does not centre care risks replicating or even exacerbating structural inequalities.

Undervaluing care and nature

The climate and care crises have resulted from the undervaluing of two things - nature and care work.

Indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) place value on - and reward - unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. Too little - or no - value is placed on the natural environment. The consequences are proving dire. Continued exploitation of raw materials and natural resources has come at the expense of the environment. The undervaluing of nature has caused pollution, loss of habitats, extinction of species and declining biodiversity.

Similarly, no value is placed on unpaid care work. What is measured and "valuable" in the calculations of GDP in an economy excludes unpaid care work, even though it is essential for sustaining livelihoods and therefore economic activity.

Care work has been cast as "women's work", although men do it too. On average, women and girls in the global south undertake over three times more unpaid care work than men.

The disproportionate responsibility for this work restricts women and girls' opportunities to pursue education or employment. The undervaluation of care work reflects gender norms that regard women's work as inherently less valuable and as something that is endless and free.

Climate change poses threats to food security, water accessibility, health and livelihoods, among many other impacts. Unpaid or under-paid tasks like providing food, collecting water and caring for the young, ill and elderly will be made more difficult by the impacts of climate change.

As we have shown above, these tasks are often, but not exclusively, carried out by women. There is also a growing trend in the global North for this work to be outsourced to women immigrants and the working class.

Anchoring care in climate policy

It is possible for humans to contribute to the regeneration of the environment instead of its depletion. But this calls for a rethink: what we value and whether this is represented in our current economic systems and policies.

The care-climate nexus conceptual framework makes two key arguments:

*liiitag One is for an expansive view of care that goes beyond person-to-person care to include caring for the environment. Centering care in responding to the climate crisis requires understanding diverse meanings and articulations of care, that include understandings of care in different contexts from the global South.

*liiitag Second, care is not only a practical concern but also an ethical and political one. It involves recognising that everything we do to maintain, continue, and repair our world is significant and crucial for life on Earth.

A focus on care and climate change means understanding and addressing interconnected socio-economic challenges. These include:

*liiitag the impact of climate change on the provision of care. Climate change adds to the unequal burden of unpaid caregiving and care work, which carries substantial economic and social repercussions.

*liiitag the conditions of care work. The labour that goes into maintaining households, raising and birthing children and sustaining communities more broadly is being undermined by an economic and social system that systematically undervalues care.

*liiitag the protection of farm workers' rights. Many in rural communities in the global South work on farms, where their agricultural labour is seen as an extension of their domestic care duties and is often precarious. Yet rural communities often do more than their share of environmental care. These forms of work should be protected and valued.

*liiitag the impact of the privatisation of public and social services on the provision of care. The growing privatisation of care services globally, like healthcare, and cuts in public expenditure on these vital services, has made it difficult for the majority to obtain proper care. Quality healthcare, for example, is out of reach for many.

*liiitag addressing the fact that care work extends beyond domestic work and includes caring for nature, land and animals.

The central theme of the upcoming annual Conference of the Parties (COP) in November is climate finance. COP is a multilateral forum that deliberates on global climate policy: this is a crucial space to emphasise and put forward proposals for better resourced caring economies as a way to build climate resilience.

This article is part of a series of articles initiated through a project led by the Southern Centre for Inequality studies, in collaboration with the International Development Research Centre and a group of feminist economists and climate scientists across the world.

HD 	Britain Has Neglected Africa and the Commonwealth for Over a Decade - 4 Ways It Can Reset Relations

The United Kingdom is resetting its relations with Africa and other countries in the global south after more than a decade of neglect. At the United Nations in September, British prime minister Keir Starmer promised his government was

returning the UK to responsible global leadership.

TD 
	

This should include reconnecting with the countries of the global south which feel they have been neglected and among whom Britain's voice is now at a discount.

The new Labour government's recently launched reviews of Britain's global impact and its international economic and development policies provide an opportunity to reevaluate and relaunch these relations. The opportunity must be seized for the sake of global stability.

The post-cold war order is fraying. America is increasingly reluctant to act as a global guarantor for a multilateral system governed by international rules and respecting human rights and freedoms. China, Russia and emerging middle powers such as Iran, Turkey and the Gulf States seem happier with a multipolar system based on the exercise of military and economic power. Meanwhile, the accelerating impact of climate change adds to the challenges to regional stability in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

I have followed these questions for nearly 50 years, as an academic and diplomat. Much has changed in those years, but recent British governments have been slow to adapt to these changes. To reconnect with countries in Africa and the global south, Britain needs a new attitude as well as new policies; and, paradoxically perhaps, the Commonwealth can play a constructive role in achieving this.

Britain's problem

Distracted by its domestic political and economic difficulties since Brexit, recent British governments have neglected both Africa and the Commonwealth.

*liiitag Aid has been cut, and policy incoherence exacerbated by the merger between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development.

*liiitag An investment conference with Africa due earlier in 2024 was scrapped at short notice.

*liiitag Successive prime ministers gave little time to meeting African and other leaders from the global south. They had no answer to the questions being asked about Britain's relationship with the south.

Yet Britain's links to these countries remain strong. Not least through the growing diaspora communities in the UK that are now an integral part of Britain's social and political fabric. With 5.5 million people of Asian heritage and 2.5 million of African or mixed heritage in the UK in 2021, these bonds need to be politically recognised.

Read more: How Commonwealth countries have forged a new way to appoint judges

Most of those Britons come from Commonwealth countries. The Commonwealth as an organisation is no substitute for closer engagement with individual countries. But it provides a forum where connections can be made and a new, more equal relationship built.

Though British governments have neglected it, King Charles, the ceremonial head of the Commonwealth, has not, as his visit to Kenya in 2023 showed. And other countries are still seeking to join, as Gabon and Togo did last year.

Commonwealth heads of government meeting

From 21-26 October Samoa will host the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (Chogm), which will choose a new secretary-general - this time from Africa. The summit brings together representatives from every continent: from G7 members to least developed countries, from the most populous country (India at 1.45 billion people) to the smallest (Tuvalu with under 10,000), from major greenhouse gas emitters to small islands at risk of disappearing beneath the sea.

Despite its imperial origins, the Commonwealth is an international network that cuts across the multi-polarity that risks dividing the world. It includes countries from the global south, the global north and the global east. The diversity makes it an ideal forum for honest conversations on difficult issues like climate change and multilateral institutional reform.

Unlike the recent Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (Focac) in Beijing, the Commonwealth is an organisation run by its members. They share common values and interests as well as a common language. They come together to exchange ideas, not pledges of investment or aid. Its traditions of democracy and equality between members make it unique and valuable. It provides, for example, a ready-made network of global influence for any member state. For small island states, particularly in the Caribbean and Pacific, it is one forum where their voices can be amplified.

This is important. With the community of nations struggling to address global challenges of the scale of climate change and pandemics, or to resolve regional conflicts, opportunities to build consensus are needed more than ever. The wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, the Sahel and the Horn of Africa are a portent of things to come if we fail to sustain a global structure that can resolve rather than exacerbate such conflicts. UN peacemaking efforts might then be crowned with success rather than with futility and frustration.

What Britain needs to do

Britain is only one among many voices, so it needs a persuasive narrative that will help preserve a world order that can tackle humanity's challenges, rather than one that simply fights over what is left. The Commonwealth, like the UN, is a place where the UK can start building support for a more equal and more effective global system.

A new narrative, and a new relationship with Africa and the global south, should be based on four elements.

Firstly, repentance for sins past. Britain's empire played a central role in making the modern world, for better and worse. While the better is often taken for granted, the sins of empire still rankle, and - like a stone in the shoe - will distract relations. Best therefore to acknowledge them, and move forward.

Secondly, the new relationship must be based on mutual respect and partnership. In particular, the age of traditional development programmes with their paternalistic tendencies is past. What countries in the global south are seeking, as many feel they do get from China, is a genuine partnership of equals that recognises the relationship as a whole and focuses on the political as well as economic sources of growth.

Thirdly, Britain needs to work with African and other southern governments to amplify their voice in multilateral institutions such as the UN and international financial institutions, so that those institutions genuinely protect their interests and those countries defend the institutions.

Finally, Britain needs to engage with the public as much as with governments in these countries. The BBC World Service, the British Council and Britain's education sector are becoming more important in challenging disinformation as the battle of narratives hots up. Now is the time to reinforce them, not let them fade away.

A new narrative along these lines at Chogm, and incorporated into the government's reviews, could be the start of a genuine reset in Britain's relationship with the global south, to the benefit of all.

The crisis of liberal democratic politics is on full display in Namibia.

Political parties participating in the November elections all appear to be centre-right organisations with insignificant differences among them.

TD 
	

By and large, the elections will be about the superficiality of personality politics.

Consequently, soft authoritarianism is everywhere.

Swapo has a dismal record of high unemployment and a lack of housing.

The party built less than 22 000 houses in three decades and it is therefore difficult to believe the talk of natural resource beneficiation and youth empowerment.

Maybe it is unsurprising as the party has never had a culture of intellectualism. Not to mention the rampant corruption and widespread nepotism.

SYMBOLISM OR SUBSTANCE?

The Independent Patriots for Change (IPC) persists with centre-right policies.

It favours austerity measures (such as fiscal discipline), which result in social disintegration.

In this context, youth entrepreneurship and home ownership are impossible.

The IPC also erroneously suggests that short-term job opportunities are a youth employment guarantee scheme.

The Landless People's Movement (LPM) refers vaguely to the state of the economy and food insecurity (no mention of food sovereignty or the agrarian question).

The Popular Democratic Movement's catchy slogan of 'one constituency, one factory' explains nothing and is hardly a serious solution for unemployment. Swanu has openly shifted to the right with support for the death penalty and homophobia.

The desperation of parliamentary politics leads to opportunism.

Affirmative Repositioning (AR) and the Namibian Economic Freedom Fighters (NEFF) don't seem to have clear political identities.

Symbolism without substance is meaningless.

'ZONE OF STORMS'

What is glaringly absent from public discourse is a left-wing conversation about a wealth tax, a proper job guarantee programme, food sovereignty, social housing and the neoliberal pension disaster.

Big business continues to make the important decisions while those political actors clamouring for places in parliament are lost in tangential discussions.

This version of democracy has nothing to do with power to the people.

If anything, the dominance of the capitalist market in Namibia leads to permanent social breakdown.

And Western imperialism ensures that our surplus value is transferred to the Global North or invested in financial speculation.

That is why the goal of debt reduction is a deliberate fabrication as it enables the absorption of the surplus.

Egyptian economist Samir Amin writes in 'The Long Revolution of the Global South' that imperialism holds the monopolies in natural resources, financial flows, new technologies, communication and weapons of mass destruction.

The only option for the Global South is to delink from the global system of monopoly capitalism.

The latter led to lumpen-development on the periphery and the dramatic rise in survivalist activities (the so-called informal economy).

The peripheries have turned into a 'zone of storms' with instability and permanent rebellion.

LOW-INTENSITY DEMOCRACY

Electoral democracy has become a farce and there must be an upswing in the struggle for the real democratisation of society.

Low-intensity democracy means people can vote but it is relatively unimportant.

This represents the failure of capitalism in the Global South which cannot offer anything other than abandoned rural areas and overcrowded urban slums.

In a recent blog, 'Delinking and Degrowth', Australian economist William Mitchell maintains that so-called free trade or global competitiveness is simply a way to channel surplus to the Global North.

Nations should rather use employment guarantees to achieve full employment and take work to their rural areas.

The comprador administration serves the interests of foreign capital and perpetuates the dependence on the Global North.

What is required is delinking for the Global South and degrowth for the Global North.

The ultimate challenge is to overcome the logic of capitalism while keeping the mode of production going.

DO WE EVEN HAVE CHOICES?

Despite the strategic importance of critical minerals on our continent, we are locked into the bottom of the global value chain.

That the Global South is caught in a deliberate structural trap is emphasised by Tunisian intellectual Fadhel Kaboub in an interview 'Africa is Designed to Stay Underdeveloped by Neo-Colonialism'.

The global system of extraction ensures we cannot invest in health, education, food, energy, manufacturing, etc.

We are to apparently remain a place for cheap raw materials.

Needless to say, these types of discussions are completely absent in the run-up to our national elections.

This speaks volumes about the limitations of Namibia's political parties.

So, in the final analysis, Namibians should go and vote against the unbridled corruption.

However, they must also organise a general strike for a wealth tax. Only mass action will bring about fundamental change.

HD 	Deputy President Calls On the UK to Raise Tariff-Free Quota On Wine, Sugar From SA

Deputy President Paul Mashatile has called on the United Kingdom government to raise the tariff-free quota (TFQ) on wine and sugar coming from South Africa.

The Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and the Mozambique Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) include provisions for a 70/30 split between bottled and bulk wine throughout the trade relationship.

TD 
	

"As the South African government, we urge flexibility for a 50/50 split. In our view, this does not necessitate an amendment of the EPA but can be a decision of the SACUM-UK Joint Council.

"South Africa has requested that the United Kingdom raise the TRQ amounts allowed under the Environmental Protection Agency Framework for South African sugar to 171 thousand tonnes and for wine to 150 million litres," he said on Monday.

The TFQ for imports of South African wine into the United Kingdom is currently sitting at 71.5 million litres per annum, which applies to 30% bulk and 70% packaged wine.

"We call for the UK to agree to this change which is mutually beneficial and will benefit the UK bottling industry."

Deputy President Mashatile was speaking during the South African Heritage Month dinner hosted by Brand South Africa in London.

The country's second-in-command is in London for the second leg of his working visit to improve trade and investment relations between the two nations.

He said he believed that if South Africa could introduce local umqombothi, also known as African beer, or more wine to the global market, the country could double exports from South Africa to the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, Netherlands and Canada.

The Deputy President said another element that has worked to construct a robust economy and enhance economic relations with the United Kingdom is the conventional interchange of commodities and services, such as food and clothes.

"As you run your company and live in this area of the globe, you must show that South Africa is a nation moulded by a diverse range of cultures, languages, and traditions, all of which contribute to the vivid mosaic that defines South Africa."

Government of National Unity

Shifting his focus to the Government of National Unity (GNU), he said the coalition government has demonstrated that South Africa embraces its diversity.

"We have shown to the world that, despite our differences, we can work together for a single goal - to create a stronger South Africa. We have also shown the world that our rainbow country has a thriving democracy."

He told the attendees that he was convinced that the GNU would endure and achieve its goals of driving inclusive growth and job creation, reducing poverty, addressing the high cost of living, and establishing a competent, ethical, and progressive State.

"However, as we mark 30 years of freedom this year, we must remember those who were at the forefront of the liberation of our nation and spent years in exile advocating for a peaceful and democratic South Africa."

The Deputy President paid tribute to those who continue to raise the South African flag high internationally by contributing to the welfare of their fellow citizens and the economy.

"We refer to these people as Global South Africans. Now to all South Africans living, working, studying or travelling abroad, it is an exciting time for you to be a Global South African - to be part of the South African story, to be a son or daughter of Africa, to be directly connected to what we confidently predict will be the African century."

He applauded Brand South Africa for launching the Global South African programme, as the country works to position itself as a global player in an increasingly competitive world.

"We believe that as Global South Africans you are an untapped voice and advocates who can elevate our nation's brand position to greater heights in international markets, whilst also shaping perceptions and the narrative about our beautiful and beloved country."

Nowadays, there are a lot of inter-state and intra-state violent conflicts and wars that can jeopardize the peace and security of the world. The world has passed through two deadly World Wars that affected almost all nations in the world in one way or another. The United Nations Organization was established in 1945 to avoid a third world war and maintain peace and security.

The United Nations has crafted various dispute settlement mechanisms to avert another world war. According to Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations, "The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement...".

TD 
	

To implement these dispute settlement methods, various international organizations are established. The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Similarly, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) is an intergovernmental organization to solve disputes through arbitration. The PCA provides services for resolving disputes involving states, intergovernmental organizations, and private parties.

However, so far there is no established intergovernmental organization for mediation method of dispute settlement. This gap is identified by China which takes the initiative in 2022 to establish the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed). Mediation, which combines both legal and diplomatic methods, helps to resolve disputes between states through equal-footed constructive dialogue, trust and consultation.

Mediation is not new to many cultures in the world. Especially the role of elders in mediation activities is significant. But this experience is not yet elevated to the international level of mediation to solve violent conflicts of states through established international organization. Mediation helps to resolve a wide range of disputes such as border conflicts, trans-boundary resource conflicts, diplomatic conflicts, commercial disputes, and the like.

The initiative of China aligns with the Charter and basic principles of the United Nations Organizations. For the last two years, China has organized four major sessions to discuss with various governments so as to establish an intergovernmental organization that works on mediation. About nineteen developing governments have supported this innovative idea of establishing mediation organization. Ten of them are from African countries. At the end of the sessions, these countries developed a Joint Statement. Based on the statement, the Preparatory Office was established in 2023 in Hong Kong. The main objective of the office was to coordinate, promote, and prepare draft convention and related instruments of IOMed. Hence, the office has prepared a draft convention of IOMed.

The last session was held in Ethiopia on 24 September 2024 in which Ambassadors of African countries, representatives from the African Union, and other international organizations presented. Ethiopia, which is actively working on the establishment of the organization, is the co-organizer of the session. These sessions helped other countries to discuss the establishment of the organization. In the last session, a lot of ideas have also been ventilated. The fifth session will be held in Hong Kong, China.

The draft convention has incorporated a preamble, establishment clause, government council, secretariat, panel of mediation, scope of cases, procedures, settlement agreements, capacity building, financing, privileges and immunity, and final clause. The convention of IOMed is translated into English, French, Arabic, Spanish, Chinese, and Russian languages. All versions are equal to be used by members. According to the draft convention, the Headquarters of the organization will be in Hong Kong, China. There will be a signing ceremony for the convention in Hong Kong and IOMed will start executing its mandate by 2025.

The mediation method is quite different from litigation. In mediation, parties are encouraged to negotiate based on interests than potions. In the case of court (ICJ) and Arbitration (PCA) parties to the dispute will present their files and conduct arguments, but they do not know what will be the outcome or decisions to be given by judges or arbitrators. Moreover, in the case of ICJ and PCA, there will be a winner and loser of the decision i.e. zero-sum game. Because of such negative impacts of litigation, there is a growing demand for mediation in the international communities. Mediation transcends the drawbacks of arbitration and court methods of dispute settlement.

In the case of mediation (IOMed), however, both sides of the disputed parties will sign on what is agreeable to them i.e. the outcome will be a "Win-Win". In the first two decisions (ICJ and PCA), parties can be relapsed into violent conflicts and wars. But in the case of IOMed, there is little possibility of a return to disputes. According to various sources, the possibility of getting a satisfactory solution from mediation is more than 80%. The outcome of mediation will bring satisfaction to parties in conflict. This is to mean that parties can choose their destiny in the mediation. Mediation doesn't simply solve the immediate problem. Since it is not an adversarial method, it reduces the stresses of parties in conflict. It also helps the preservation of good relationships of parties.

International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) can also fill the gap of global governance injustice which is dominated by the Western countries. Even if there are many international criminal activities in the world to be investigated, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is being criticized for putting pressure on Africa and other least-developed countries. IOMed can mitigate such unnecessary pressure from global governance injustices.

IOMed has a lot of significant importance to maintain peace and security in the world. To begin with, it is one of the instruments of peace-making in the world. It also upholds international order and works based on the basic principles of the United Nations. It can also amplify the voices of countries in the Global South. Moreover, it can serve as a valuable complement to existing international dispute resolution mechanisms.

IOMed doesn't aim to replace the current conflict resolution mechanisms; instead, it will enrich it. IOMed gives priority to harmony, equality, justice, and respect. It is flexible, cost-effective, voluntary, and confidential, far from prejudice, preserves relationships of parties, and is convenient.

Even if China took the initiative, the organization belongs to the Global South and nations of the world at large. Membership will be open to all countries of the world. To make this initiative realistic, China will shoulder much of the financial burden at the time of establishment until it gets ample finances from member states and other organizations. Member states will also contribute relatively little money to the organization.

There are various reasons to join IOMed. These include the organization paving the way towards a more peaceful, harmonious and prosperous future, solving disputes through a fair and a "Win-Win" approach rather than a "Win-Lose Or Lose-Lose" approach and establishing sustainable peace and security; the financial burden for members being very minimal; eligibility to be officials of the IOMed secretariat; it will be a good opportunity of participation in the international law-making process; the presence of various capacity building programmes for the staff of the organization; it will also be a platform for sharing experiences and best practices of various countries; it also helps to advance justice and rule of law; it complements international dispute settlement mechanisms; it will give quicker solution than courts; it respects the principle of sovereignty and equality of states and the like.

IOMed is a good opportunity for Africa and the Global South at large. Currently, there are many violent conflicts in Africa. Most of them can be solved through IOMed. Parties to conflicts can get faster solutions to their problems. Through the mediation process, both sides can get common ground that may lead them to reach voluntary and mutually acceptable agreements. The process of mediation is not as complex as that of international court and arbitration. This makes IOMed convenient for African countries.

In my opinion, some of the mediation can also be conducted through online systems. As long as there are preferences by the parties mediation can be done using state-of-the-art technology. This is because of the flexibility of mediation mechanisms. Such an approach will save time and cost for parties in conflicts.

Litigation is no longer the first option to solve disputes. Resolving problems through court should be the last resort. Before using the option of court, mediation can solve many problems in the world. Hence, mediation can ease the file burdens in international arbitration and the International Court of Justice. This will complement the peace and security activities of the United Nations Organization. If mediation fails to solve the problem of the parties, there will be the option of arbitration and court which are costly, and time-consuming, and the outcome can disappoint one or both parties.

For the mediation process, there should be a third party who is neutral and facilitates negotiations between and among various contending parties. IOMed will have such neutral mediators who can provide proposals by using creative approaches to solve problems. These mediators do not take sides; rather they facilitate the negotiations between parties and also help to get clarification of issues at hand. Impartiality is the heart and soul of IOMed. Its members can designate mediators of their own.

Not all dispute resolution mechanisms are perfect by themselves. Similarly, not all problems can be solved by the mediation method. However, it is possible to say that mediation is one of the best methods to solve violent conflicts of states, and between other entities.

To sum up, IOMed is another prominent action in the world of diplomacy. This convention is open to be signed by governments of the world. It is inclusive to all nations who believe in the establishment of such an important intergovernmental legal organization. Africa and other countries in the Global South should grab this great opportunity to solve their problems. The first signatories of the convention will be the founding members of the IOMed. They will be at the forefront of making global history. Those who join later will get the right of accession to the organization.

TD 
	

The 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) was successfully held in Beijing from September 4 to 6. It is an important milestone in the history of China-Africa relations. Under the theme of "Joining Hands to Advance Modernization and Build a High-Level China-Africa Community with a Shared Future," Chinese President Xi Jinping, together with leaders from 53 African countries which have diplomatic relations with China and Chairperson of the African Union Commission (AUC), took stock of the journey of China-Africa friendship, commended the progress made in implementing the outcomes of FOCAC, and reached a clear consensus on strengthening cooperation across the board. Nearly 6,000 Chinese and foreign guests, including the Secretary-General of the United Nations as a special guest and representatives from more than 30 international and African regional organizations, attended the great event.

As both developing countries and the Global South, China and African countries have been fighting shoulder to shoulder against imperialism, colonialism, and hegemonism, and advancing hand in hand along the path of development, revitalization, and modernization. Our deep brotherly friendship has been forged during this process. After Xi Jinping became the President of China, he set foot in Africa on his first foreign visit and put forward the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith for China's Africa policy, which pressed the "acceleration button" for the development of China-Africa relations.

For the past 24 years, since the establishment of FOCAC, high-level interactions between China and Africa have become increasingly close, political mutual trust has continued to deepen, and practical cooperation has yielded fruitful results.

China-Africa exchanges in various fields have been unprecedentedly active; exchanges and mutual learning in tourism, culture, youth and media have flourished.

The 2024 Summit of FOCAC has achieved full success. Two important documents, Beijing Declaration on Jointly Building an All-Weather China-Africa Community with a Shared Future for the New Era and Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2025-2027) were adopted unanimously. I would like to introduce the main outcomes of the summit with three "new" phrases.

First, China-Africa relations are elevated to a new level. China has always regarded developing relations with African countries as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. At the summit, President Xi Jinping proposed that bilateral relations between China and all African countries having diplomatic ties with China be elevated to the level of strategic relations. Chinese and African leaders unanimously agreed that the overall characterization of China-Africa relations be elevated to an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era. China and Africa will stand shoulder to shoulder to play a greater role in promoting the well-being of the Chinese and African people and maintaining world peace and stability.

Second, new propositions on China- Africa joint efforts to advance modernization was articulated; As we are about to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are going all out to build a great modern country in all respects and pursue national rejuvenation through a Chinese path to modernization. Africa is also marching in solid strides toward the modernization goals set forth in the AU's Agenda 2063.

China will remain a reliable partner with Africa on the journey towards modernization. President Xi Jinping pointed out that China and Africa should advance modernization that is just and equitable, that is open and win-win, that puts the people first, that features diversity and inclusiveness, that is eco-friendly, and that is underpinned by peace and security. These propositions resonated with African leaders, thus becoming a political consensus between China and Africa. They will surely have a significant and far-reaching impact on spearheading faster modernization of the Global South and advancing global modernization.

Third, a new blueprint was drawn up for China-Africa cooperation going forward. President Xi Jinping announced ten partnership actions that China would take with Africa to advance modernization in the next three years. The actions include giving all least developed countries having diplomatic relations with China, including 33 countries in Africa, zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines, providing Africa with RMB one billion Yuan in emergency food assistance, creating at least one million jobs for Africa, etc. The Chinese government will provide RMB 360 billion Yuan of financial support through the next three years to promote the implementation of the ten partnership actions.

During the Summit, China and Africa also had strategic communication on the international situation and global governance. We agreed to firmly support each other on issues involving our respective core interests, defend the common interests of developing countries, and promote international fairness and justice. We agreed to follow true multilateralism, implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and champion an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We agreed to reject "small yard, high fence," oppose discrimination and prejudice, redress historical injustices, and ensure that all people will benefit from the modernization process. The FOCAC "summit week" is a "Global South moment," a highlight of the joint pursuit of a community with a shared future for mankind.

President Xi Jinping met with Chairperson of AUC Moussa Faki Mahamat during the Summit, pointing out that AU is a banner for Africa to seek strength through unity and an important platform for conducting international cooperation. China supports AU in playing a greater role in the cause of China-Africa friendship, and is ready to take this FOCAC Summit as an opportunity to push for more outcomes of China- AU cooperation in various fields and promote the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future to a new level.

As the emblem of FOCAC, "Embracing Hands" is a vivid portrayal of China and Africa working together to promote modernization and build a community with a shared future. Faced with a world full of changes and turbulence, China and Africa need to strengthen unity and cooperation more than ever before. China is willing to work with AU and African countries to actively implement the outcomes of the summit, work together to promote modernization, build an all-weather China- Africa community with a shared future in the new era, so as to make greater contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind.

HD 	UN Security Council - African Countries Face Hurdles and Dangers in Getting Permanent Seats

There is growing global consensus among the members of the United Nations that the UN security council, responsible for maintaining international peace and security, requires reform or restructuring to reflect the current balance of forces, and to improve its working methods and ability to do its work.

There is also growing consensus among members of the African Union that Africa deserves a permanent presence at the council.

TD 
	

The debate took a new turn on 13 September, when the US announced it would support the creation of two new permanent seats for African countries, and a non-permanent seat for small island developing nations. This came after a pledge in 2022 by the Biden administration to support the expansion of the security council.

The new permanent seats would come without the power of a veto vote.

Read more: Africa on the UN security council: why the continent should have two permanent seats

There are several reasons why, in my view, this quest to expand the council is likely to fail. I have followed and published on the South African experience of the UN security council and believe there is need for a sober assessment of what is achievable.

First, those with permanent seats and veto power (Russia and China, the US, the UK and France) are reluctant to share it, for fear of diluting their own interests and influence.

Second, if there was agreement on expansion, who would be worthy to fill the extra seats, and how would they be chosen? There are many deserving candidates, from Latin America to Europe and Asia.

Third, how would Africa go about selecting two of its own to represent the continent on the council?

Fourth, what would prevent such newcomers from being co-opted by the powerful (in this case, the US) to support or help implement western peace and security agendas at the expense of African and global south agendas?

To offset the attractiveness and prestige of joining the premier international security club, Africa should be mindful of the entry requirements (namely, diplomatic nous, experience with peacekeeping and the ability to finance such), lest it find itself relegated to serving the security council's longstanding members.

Africa would be wise to select and support candidates that have experience, resources and a credible peacebuilding track record on the continent.

Hurdles and dangers

It is far from obvious that the continent's two economic giants, Nigeria and South Africa, should represent Africa. Size counts but doesn't always translate into attractiveness or credibility at home - a key requirement for a successful role in regional and international affairs.

The unfortunate reality is that Africa remains divided on the basis of region, language and culture. The continent struggles to speak with one voice on critical matters such as peace and security - the priority of the UN security agenda.

Under these conditions, a drawn-out and perhaps even unsuccessful process of selecting two out of the 54 members of the African Union is likely.

In addition, the offer by the west for Africa to take up seats should not be viewed as an act of benevolence. Bringing Africa into the western sphere of influence is a strategic calculation to counter the growing impact of Russia and China on global affairs.

The emergence of a new world order produces stresses and strains. The west, led by the US, continues to exercise hard power but declining influence, while an assertive alliance of global south states, led by China, is bent on eventually determining international affairs.

Prominent members of the global south are enticed or pressured to partner with one or the other power bloc.

Africa in particular is being courted precisely because of its large voting number (54 countries can swing decisions at multilateral meetings) but more strategically, because it constitutes the reservoir of the world's future economy. Apart from being blessed with a youthful demographic, Africa can come into central focus due to its unique endowment of green transition minerals like cobalt, lithium and nickel.

Where to from here?

If all obstacles are overcome, the chosen countries would have their work cut out for them. Serving - never mind shaping - the UN security council agenda is a demanding, full-time task. The chosen African countries would have to commit significant human and financial resources, peacebuilding capacity and diplomatic leadership skills.

South Africa is arguably the best placed to meet these criteria and can play a constructive role pushing the African agenda. But it needs to be wary.

The country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, was quick to respond to the US statement. On the eve of departing for the annual UN general assembly talk show he told the media

We have been campaigning and the concept has been accepted and of course Africa continues to play through various countries on the continent, important roles, peacekeeping missions not only on our continent but around the world. So, we [have] got the capability, we know how and Africa needs to be given its rightful place in the UN system and its various structures.

Some critical questions need to be answered by all African leaders first:

*liiitag What are the benefits for an African country taking up a permanent seat on the UN security council?

*liiitag How would it contribute, and what would it receive in return?

*liiitag Would it be able to set agendas and norms, or would it be forced to carry out the tasks of those who allowed it a seat at the table?

Africa is not unfamiliar with the workings of the United Nations system. It has benefited immensely from UN involvement as it strove for decolonialisation and overcoming the apartheid system. It works closely with the UN as it faces the challenges of underdevelopment, unequal trade, extreme weather and the ongoing exploitation of its human and natural resources.

It is fitting and ethical for Africa to take up permanent seats at the apex institution and put the security council to work to address Africa's peace and security challenges.

To do so, its chosen members must chart an African course of action, supported by the other members of the council.

HD 	Why Chinese Embassy Is Behind Focac Resolutions Implementation

THE Chinese Embassy to Tanzania has expressed readiness and commitment to work with the Tanzanian government to implement the outcomes of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) meeting in Beijing.

Here, the September 4th to 6th 2024 will go to the annals of history as the period when China and Africa reinforced their friendship in what was baptised as the FOCAC.

TD 
	

During the occasion in Beijing, significant attention was drawn on various areas ranging from Investment in Infrastructure, Trade Expansion, Technology Transfer, Capacity Building and Support for Industrialisation among others as the pillars to develop Africa.

Investment in Infrastructure: Analysts note that China has committed substantial resources to developing Africa's infrastructure--roads, railways, ports and energy projects. This investment is crucial for enhancing connectivity and trade within the continent.

Trade Expansion: FOCAC discussions frequently focus on increasing trade volumes between China and African countries. The goal is to create more favourable trade terms and reduce tariffs, which could boost African exports and diversify economies.

Technology Transfer: Many analysts highlight the potential for technology transfer, particularly in sectors like agriculture, renewable energy and telecommunications. Collaborative projects can help African nations adopt innovative technologies that drive sustainable development.

Capacity Building: Education and training programs are often a focal point. Analysts see these initiatives as vital for building local skills and capacity, enabling African nations to better manage their resources and improve governance.

Support for Industrialisation: FOCAC emphasises promoting industrialisation in Africa. Analysts argue that this can help African countries move up the value chain in global markets, leading to job creation and economic resilience.

Climate Change and Sustainability: With increasing focus on environmental issues, analysts suggest that FOCAC provides an opportunity for Africa to engage with China on sustainable practices, particularly in sectors like renewable energy and conservation.

As these featured in the meeting, Tanzania's attention was also drawn to the revitalisation of the TAZARA (Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority) project through the China-Tanzania friendship.

With discussions, it was noted that it culminated in the increased investment approach. Here, enhanced bilateral relations could lead to renewed Chinese investment in TAZARA. This funding could help upgrade infrastructure, improve rail services and expand capacity, making the railway more efficient.

On technical support: China's expertise in railway construction and management can facilitate knowledge transfer. This includes modern technologies for maintenance and operations, which can significantly improve TAZARA's performance.

Looked at with the lens of trade and economic growth- A revitalised TAZARA can boost trade between Tanzania and Zambia, as well as with neighbouring countries. Improved transport links will lower shipping costs, enhance supply chains and attract more businesses to the region.

Job Creation: Upgrading the railway will create jobs both during the construction phase and in ongoing operations. This can have a significant positive impact on local communities.

Regional Connectivity: By revitalising TAZARA, China and Tanzania can improve regional connectivity, making it easier for landlocked countries like Zambia to access ports in Tanzania. This can enhance economic integration within the Southern African region.

Sustainable Development: Collaborating on TAZARA can align with broader initiatives for sustainable transport, reducing reliance on road transport and its associated environmental impacts.

Strengthened Diplomatic Ties: Successful revitalisation of TAZARA can serve as a symbol of the deepening China-Tanzania partnership, enhancing diplomatic relations and paving the way for future collaborations in other sectors.

Overall, the renewed focus on TAZARA underlines the potential of the China-Tanzania friendship to facilitate economic development and strengthen regional ties in East and Southern Africa.

Commenting on the above, Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania Chen Mingjian noted that China-Africa community relation is a all-weather season, where all benefit for a shared future.

She further said that the friendship between China and Africa transcends time and space, surmounts mountains and oceans and passes down through generations.

She added: We share weal and woe in fighting natural disasters and epidemics together. We always empathize with and support each other, setting a stellar example of building a community with a shared future for mankind.

From a new type of partnership to relations

This progress demonstrates the firm resolve of the over 2.8 billion Chinese and African people to share weal and woe and march forward hand in hand amid once-in-a-century transformation of the world, and opens a new chapter in the cause of building a community with a shared future for mankind.

In this regard, President Xi Jinping articulated a six-point proposition on China-Africa joint efforts to advance modernisation. First, we should jointly advance modernisation, increase exchanges of governance experience and support all countries in exploring modernisation paths be fitting their national conditions.

We should jointly advance the modernisation that is open and win-win, deepen cooperation with Africa in areas such as industry and agriculture, and build together a model for the delivery of the Global Development Initiative.

We should jointly advance modernisation the third put is put as the people first, make vigorous efforts to promote personnel training, poverty reduction and employment, and ensure that all will benefit from the modernisation process.

This proposition is widely accepted by African leaders and has become a political consensus between China and Africa. It marks the two sides deepening understanding of the rules governing modernisation, and will have a significant and far-reaching impact on spearheading faster modernisation of the Global South and advancing global modernisation.

Partnership Actions

In our approach, Tanzania will have zero-tariff treatment for 100 per cent Tarif lines. Here, 'we will help turn China's big market into Africa's big opportunity. Again, China is prepared to put in place a China-Africa network featuring land-sea links and coordinated development for the benefit of trans-regional development in Africa.

In addition, China will encourage and support Africa in issuing panda bonds in China to enhance our results-oriented cooperation in all areas.

As an important FOCAC member, Tanzania has always actively participated in the forum's activities and supported its development. Mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides have been deepened.

Since the establishment of the forum, China-Tanzania trade volume has increased from less than US $100 million in 2000 to US $8.78 billion in 2023, an increase that is nearly 88 times.

In quick analysis, President Samia Suluhu Hassan's visit to China was a great success and that further made China and Tanzania strengthened their mutual political trust.

When meeting with President Samia, President Xi Jinping pointed out that the Chinese side stands ready to make Tanzania a demonstration zone for deepening China-Africa high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and work with Tanzania to make China-Tanzania relations a model for China-Africa relations and Global South cooperation, and make greater contributions in the implementation of the consensus reached by two heads of state.

The TAZARA Railway conforms to the visions of Tanzania/ government and is conducive to the practical cooperation between China and Tanzania, to further take advantage of our complementary resource endowment.

It is projected that annual tonnage will rise from the current combined average of 500,000 metric tonnes for all operators to approximately 2 million metric tonnes.

It is also anticipated that the rehabilitation of both infrastructure and rolling stock will take approximately two years. Once the TAZARA railway is revitalised, the development of product processing, retail, horticulture, real estate and service industries in the region and along the railway lines will be boosted, promoting transnational and trans-regional cooperation to benefit local people.

As President Xi put it, "We are not alone on the Great Way and the whole world is one family." "Chinese modernisation" emphasises national uniqueness and autonomy while advocating for shared human values. And in order to join hands to advance modernisation and build a high-level China-Africa Community with a shared future, China has announced during the FOCAC Summit that RMB360 billion yuan of financial support will be provided through the next three years, turning concepts into concrete actions.

The whole budget breaks down into RMB210 billion yuan of credit line, RMB80 billion yuan of assistance in various forms, and at least RMB70 billion yuan of investment in Africa by Chinese companies. In addition, China will encourage and support Africa in issuing panda bonds in China to enhance our results-oriented cooperation in all areas.

These have sent a powerful message of China and Tanzania, along with other African brothers, continuing to work together as partners on the path of modernisation and contributing more to building a community with a shared future for humankind. The FOCAC "summit week" is a "Global South moment," a highlight of the joint pursuit of a community with a shared future for mankind.

HD 	Governments Using Billions of Public Funds to Subsidize Climate-Destructive Industries--Report

A report examining corporate capture of public finance is accusing industries fueling the climate crisis, including fossil fuel ones, of draining public funds in the Global South, singling them out for squeezing out of governments USD 700 billion in public subsidies each year.

The report, How theFinance Flows: Corporate capture of public finance fuelling the climate crisis in the Global South, released on 17 September says that the climate-destructive sectors are benefiting from money that could go to paying for schooling for all Sub-Saharan African children 3.5 times over, even as Global South renewable energy projects remain starved of cash, receiving 40 times less public finance than the fossil fuels sector.

TD 
	

While urging governments in the developing world to allocate more of their limited resources in ways that "truly serve their people's needs" through climate solutions for food and energy, the analysis of financial flows by ActionAid reveals that the fossil fuel sector in the region received a staggering annual average of USD 438.6 billion a year in subsidies, between 2016 (when the Paris Agreement was signed) and 2023.

The industrial agriculture sector alone benefited from the government subsidies equivalent to a whopping USD 238 billion a year on average between 2016 and 2021, even as it continued to contribute to the worsening of nature, it reveals.

It further reveals that the industries causing the climate crisis are also draining the lion's share of public funds, including in "climate-hit countries," in places like Sub-Saharan Africa, even as initiatives providing climate solutions remain severely underfunded.

The report points to corporate capture of public finance, combined with a lack of international climate finance, as some of the factors holding back climate action in some of the "countries and communities that need it most".

While also finding that climate finance grants from the Global North for climate-hit countries are still grossly insufficient to support climate action and the necessary transitions in the southern hemisphere, it gives examples of several countries in Africa where policies in place were in conflict with actual reality actions.

These include the fossil fuel-rich African countries of South Africa and Nigeria, which have been found to be heavily subsidizing the discredited sector.

The countries, including Bangladesh in South Asia, Action Aid says were providing fuel subsidies up to between 22 and 33 times the "per capita level of annual public investment in renewable energy" flow, for example.

As a result, in the hemisphere, renewable energy initiatives are receiving 40 times less public finance than the fossils sector, while climate finance grants amount to just a 20th of the Global South's public finance going to fossils and industrial agriculture.

"While trillions of dollars in climate finance from the Global North to the Global South are necessary to adequately address the climate and development crises, Global South governments must allocate their limited resources in ways that truly serve their people's needs through climate solutions for food and energy," it says.

"Meanwhile, the failure of Global North countries to provide adequate climate finance for climate transitions means that Global South countries are locked into harmful development pathways that destroy ecosystems, grab lands and compound the injustice of climate change," it adds.

Citing the example of Southern Africa's Zambia, it says that the industrial agriculture sector in the country gobbled up 80 percent of the national agriculture budget in 2023, through subsidies for "climate-harming synthetic fertilizer's and commercial seeds."

"Meanwhile, only 6 percent of the Agriculture Ministry's Agricultural Development and Productivity Programme was spent on supporting farmers to adopt agroecological, nature-friendly farming approaches, that naturally strengthen soil fertility and reduce dependency on agrochemical inputs," it explains the contradiction.

Zambia's neighbor Zimbabwe has made public policy statements in support of a shift towards agroecology, a shift evidenced by 34 percent of the country's agriculture budget this year supporting farmers to adopt practices to move from climate-destructive agrochemicals.

Despite that, Zimbabwe is still using approximately 50 percent of its entire national agriculture budget towards subsidizing industrial agribusiness inputs such as fertilizers and hybrid seeds," signaling the industry's continued control over the sector and budget, as well as the potential to free up more public finances for public good'.

Two west African countries, the Gambia and Senegal, and South America's Brazil were equally found to be engaging in contradictory practices, making public investments in renewable energy, on a scale that is almost comparable to the per capita public subsidy provision for fossil fuels.

In the Gambia, the scale of public investment in renewable energy is more than four-fifths that of public finance provided to fossil fuels; while in Brazil and Senegal, the scale of renewables investment was found to be two-thirds that of fossil fuel subsidies.

"Kenya's ambition to be a global leader in renewable energy is borne out by the finding that per capita investment in renewables in the country is outspending public subsidy provision to fossil fuels. However, recent protests in Kenya against the government's reduction of fossil fuel subsidies underline the importance of feminist Just Transition principles," the investigation found.

"Shifts in public financing must be carefully sequenced to protect the rights of people--especially women--living in poverty. Any reductions in fossil fuel subsidies should target the wealthy corporations first. Only once accessible and democratic alternatives and comprehensive social protections are available to people on low incomes, should progressive policies be shifted," the analysis concluded.

The report further found that governments in the North continue to disproportionately fuel the climate crisis, and even though the developed world has just a quarter of the world's population, their annual average fossil fuel subsidies amounted to USD 239.7 billion.

Action Aid laments that renewable energy public investment in the Global South comes to an annual average of USD 10.3 billion each year, noting that even worse, renewable energy investment in the South has been on a downward trend, more than halving from USD 15 billion in 2016 to USD 7 billion in 2021.

It calls on governments to speed up the transition to green, resilient, democratic and people-led climate solutions for food and energy, such as renewable energy and agroecology. "For Global South countries already experiencing the devastating consequences of climate change, the need for global transition is all the more urgent".

According to Arthur Larok, Secretary General of ActionAid International, the report further helps expose wealthy corporations' 'parasitic' behavior.

"They are draining the life out of the Global South by siphoning public funds and fueling the climate crisis. Sadly, the promises of climate finance by the Global North are as hollow as the empty rhetoric they have been uttering for decades. It is time for this circus to end; we need genuine commitments to ending the climate crisis," he said.

The report also debunks the "false narrative" that fossil fuel and industrial agriculture expansion in the Global South is necessary to address food insecurity and energy poverty and to provide livelihoods and public revenue, said Teresa Anderson, Global Lead on Climate Justice at ActionAid International and one of the report's authors.

"It seems that money is the root of all climate upheaval. Climate-destructive industries are bleeding the Global South of the public funds they should be using to deal with the climate crisis. "The lack of public and climate finance for solutions means that in climate-vulnerable countries, renewable energy is receiving 40 times less public finance than the fossil fuel sector," she added.

The time had come for the poor to stand up to industries that are draining their finances and wrecking the climate.

Public resources, the report recommends, should be directed toward supporting just transition away from climate-destructive fossil fuels and industrial agriculture and in favor of "people-led climate solutions that safeguard people's rights to food, energy and livelihoods."

It should also go to scaling up decentralized renewable energy systems to provide energy access, and gender-responsive agricultural extension services that offer training in agro-ecology and adaptation.

It appeals to wealthy countries to provide "trillions of dollars in grant-based climate finance each year to Global South countries on the front lines of the climate crisis," including by agreeing to an ambitious new climate finance goal at COP29.

Further, it calls for regulation of the banking and finance sectors to end destructive financing, including setting minimum standards for human rights, social and environmental frameworks, and transformation of the international financial institutions that are pushing climate-vulnerable countries into "spiraling debt."

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Africa has urged leaders from the Global South to demand equitable health measures in ongoing World Health Organization (WHO) Pandemic Agreement talks.

AHF Africa made the call on Wednesday while hosting a virtual press conference as part of its global Save Our Society (SOS) campaign.

TD 
	

The organization emphasized the urgent need for binding commitments focused on technology transfer to boost regional production of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics which it says is crucial to ensuring lower-income countries are not left behind in future health crises.

"Establishing a regional production mechanism is vital--it will ensure that developing countries can independently produce and distribute essential health products during any health crisis," stated Guillermina Alaniz, AHF's Director of Global Advocacy and Policy.

"This will reduce reliance on wealthier nations and promote equitable access for all."

Alaniz stressed the need for countries in the Global South taking part in the ongoing Pandemic Agreement talks in Geneva to link the Agreement's Article 11, which addresses technology transfer, with Article 12, which focuses on the World Health Organization's Pathogen Access and Benefits Sharing System (PABS).

AHF noted that such discussions should be done in addition to the annual financial contributions and the percentages to be set aside through benefit-sharing provisions.

'Profits above lives'

Speakers at the conference also underscored how the Global North continues to put pharmaceutical profits above lives, particularly in the Global South.

They called for the WHO Pandemic Agreement to include binding provisions that ensure technology transfer necessary to build health resilience in developing countries.

"It's not enough to claim equity without taking real steps to achieve it," Alaniz added, emphasizing that the current commitment of setting aside only 20% of pandemic-related products for 80 per cent of the world's population is inadequate.

"We need the inclusion of technology transfer provisions in the PABS to empower the Global South to produce these products during global health crises, ensuring a more equitable and effective response."

AHF Kenya's Country Program Director Dr. Samuel Kinyanjui highlighted the challenges African nations face in international negotiations.

Lack of preparedness

Kinyanjui said that one of the key factors that weaken African countries in negotiations is a lack of preparedness.

"African representation often arrives late and under-resourced, with teams lacking the legal and economic expertise needed to navigate complex treaties," he said.

Kinyanjui stressed the importance of including civil society in negotiations and presenting a unified front, rather than fragmented national positions that undermine collective bargaining power.

The Africa Director of the Pandemic Action Network, Aggrey Aluso, lauded the recent efforts by the Africa CDC to enhance African leadership in the negotiation process.

However, he cautioned that significant hurdles remain, particularly in securing clear support from African capitals and resolving legal ambiguities that could weaken the agreement.

"The negotiations are caught between conflicting interests--public health versus industry profits," Aluso explained.

Non-binding deals

He criticized high-income countries for pushing non-binding agreements and discretionary financing models that have repeatedly failed during past health emergencies.

Aluso also called out what he described as the double standards in global health financing, where he argues philanthropy-based contributions lack accountability and fail to meet urgent needs.

"Everyone talks about equity, but the real challenge lies in creating an equitable system. A philanthropy-based, discretionary system will never ensure true equity," he stated, urging both high-income countries and African states to invest in robust, accountable financing mechanisms for the Pandemic Agreement.

AHF Africa Bureau Chief Dr. Penninah Lutung challenged leaders from around the world to "turn words into action and ensure that everyone is safe"

She pointed out that African countries and other nations struggling to prepare for the next global public health disaster cannot afford a repeat of what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In December 2021, the Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated a global process to draft and negotiate a convention, agreement, or other international instrument ('Pandemic Agreement') aimed at strengthening pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response.

After more than two years of negotiations, countries failed to reach an agreement by this year's World Health Assembly (WHA), leading the assembly to extend the mandate of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) to continue negotiations until 2025.

The 11th meeting of the INB taking place from September 9-20, 2024, will make decisions that could reshape global pandemic preparedness and response.

HD 	The Global South in the New Cold War

Marginalised and dominated economically by the Global North, developing countries must urgently cooperate to better strive for their shared interests in achieving world peace and sustainable development.

Cold War rivalry

TD 
	

During the first Cold War between the US, NATO, and other allies, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union and its allies, the former prided itself on sustaining economic growth, especially during the post-war Golden Age.

Since the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), successive governments - led by Obama, Trump and Biden - have all strived to sustain full employment in the US. However, real wages and working conditions for most have suffered.

Exceptionally among monetary authorities, the US Fed's mandate includes ensuring full employment. However, without the US-Soviet rivalry of the first Cold War, Washington no longer seeks a buoyant, growing world economy.

This has affected US relations with its NATO and other allies, most of which have been hit by worldwide economic stagnation since the GFC. Instead of ensuring worldwide recovery, 'unconventional monetary policies' addressing the ensuing Great Recession have enabled further financialisation.

Interest rate hikes slow growth

Since early 2022, the US has raised interest rates unnecessarily. Stanley Fischer, later IMF Deputy Managing Director and US Federal Reserve Bank Vice Chair, and colleague Rudiger Dornbusch found low double-digit inflation acceptable, even desirable for growth.

Before the fetishisation of the 2% inflation target, other mainstream economists reached similar conclusions in the late 20th century. Since then, the US Fed and most other Western central banks have been fixated on inflation targeting, which has no theoretical or empirical justification.

Fiscal austerity policies have complemented such monetary priorities, compounding contractionary macroeconomic policy pressures. Many governments are being 'persuaded' that fiscal policy is too important to be left to finance ministers.

Instead, independent fiscal boards are setting acceptable public debt and deficit levels. Hence, macroeconomic policies are inducing stagnation everywhere.

While Europe has primarily embraced such policies, Japan has not subscribed to them. Nevertheless, this new Western policy dogma invokes economic theory and policy experience when, in fact, neither supports it.

The US Fed's raising interest rates since early 2022 has triggered capital flight from developing economies, leaving the poorest countries worse off. Earlier financial inflows into low-income countries have since left in great haste.

New Cold War contractionary

The new Cold War has worsened the macroeconomic situation, further depressing the world economy. Meanwhile, geopolitical considerations increasingly trump developmental and other priorities.

The growing imposition of illegal sanctions has reduced investment and technology flows to the Global South. Meanwhile, the weaponisation of economic policy is fast spreading and becoming normalised.

After the Iraq invasion fiasco, the US, NATO and others often do not seek UN Security Council to endorse sanctions. Hence, their sanctions contravene the UN Charter and international law. Nonetheless, such illegal sanctions have been imposed with impunity.

With most of Europe now in NATO, the OECD, G7 and other US-led Western institutions have increasingly undermined UN-led multilateralism, which they had set up and still dominate but no longer control.

Inconvenient international law provisions are ignored or only invoked when useful. The first Cold War ended with a unipolar moment, but this did not stop new challenges to US power, typically in response to its assertions of authority.

Such unilateral sanctions have compounded other supply-side disruptions, such as the pandemic, and exacerbated recent contractionary and inflationary pressures.

In response, Western powers raised interest rates in concert, worsening the ongoing economic stagnation by reducing demand without effectively addressing supply-side inflation.

The internationally agreed sustainable development and climate targets have thus become more unattainable. Poverty, inequality and precariousness have worsened, especially for the most needy and vulnerable.

Limited options for South

Due to its diversity, the Global South faces various constraints. The problems faced by the poorest low-income countries are quite different from those in East Asia, where foreign exchange constraints are less of a problem.

IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath has argued that developing countries should not be aligned in the new Cold War.

This suggests that even those walking the corridors of power in Washington recognise the new Cold War is exacerbating the protracted stagnation since the 2008 global financial crisis.

Josep Borrell - the second most important European Commission official, in charge of international affairs - sees Europe as a garden facing invasion by the surrounding jungle. To protect itself, he wants Europe to attack the jungle first.

Meanwhile, many - including some foreign ministers of leading non-aligned nations - argue that non-alignment is irrelevant after the end of the first Cold War.

Non-alignment of the old type - a la Bandung in 1955 and Belgrade in 1961 - may be less relevant, but a new non-alignment is needed for our times. Today's non-alignment should include firm commitments to sustainable development and peace.

BRICS's origins are quite different, excluding less economically significant developing countries. Although not representative of the Global South, it has quickly become important.

Meanwhile, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) remains marginalised. The Global South urgently needs to get its act together despite the limited options available to it.

HD 	Disease and Climate Stress Resistant Wheat Varieties for Global South

Groundbreaking research indicates that the wild relatives of wheat could be turned into an all-time food security crop capable of cushioning vulnerable populations from starvation and hunger, thanks to its ability to withstand both climatic stress and diseases. Wheat is a staple for over 1.5 billion people in the Global South.

The review looked at two different studies and found that using the ancient genetic diversity of wild relatives of wheat, which provides 20 percent of the world's calories and protein, could lead to weather- and disease-resistant varieties of the crop. This could ensure food security around the world.

TD 
	

The study led by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre reveals that "long overlooked" wild wheat relatives have the potential to revolutionise wheat breeding, with new varieties capable of withstanding climate change and associated threats, including heat waves, droughts, flooding, and emerging and current pests and diseases.

Wild wheat relatives, which have endured environmental stresses for millions of years, possess genetic traits that modern varieties lack--traits that, when integrated into conventional varieties, could make wheat farming more possible in ever more hostile climates, the study published today (August 26, 2024) explains.

By farming the more resilient wheat, productivity could increase by an estimated USD 11 billion worth of extra grain every year, says the authors in the review paper titled 'Wheat genetic resources have avoided disease pandemics, improved food security, and reduced environmental footprints: A review of historical impacts and future opportunities' published by the journal Wiley Global Change Biology.

The review suggests that the use of plant genetic resources (PGR) helps against various diseases like wheat rust and defends against diseases that jump species barriers, like wheat blast. It gives nutrient-dense varieties and polygenic traits that create climate resilience.

The study points to a vast, largely untapped reservoir of nearly 800,000 wheat seed samples stored in 155 gene banks worldwide that include wild varieties and ancient farmer-developed ones that have withstood diverse environmental stresses over millennia. This is despite the fact that only a fraction of this genetic diversity has been utilised in modern crop breeding.

The findings, according to co-author Mathew Reynolds, will have major implications for food security, particularly in the Sub-Saharan Africa region, where the world's most food-insecure populations live.

"The discoveries are very promising, as Africa has a lot of new environments in terms of potential wheat cultivation," he told IPS.

Based on the research findings, significant environmental benefits have been realised thanks to various scientific efforts that have successfully integrated wild genes into modern species.

The study acknowledges that the use of PGR in wheat breeding has improved the nutrition and livelihoods of resource-constrained farmers and consumers in the Global South, where wheat is often the cereal of choice in parts of Asia and Africa

"We're at a critical juncture," says Reynolds. "Our current breeding strategies have served us well, but they must now address more complex challenges posed by climate change."

He observes that breeding that helps in maintaining genetic resistance to a range of diseases improves "yield stability" and avoids epidemics of devastating crop diseases that ultimately threaten food security for millions.

"Furthermore, post-Green Revolution genetic yield gains are generally achieved with less (in the Global North) and often no fungicide in the Global South, and without necessarily increasing inputs of fertilizer or irrigation water, with the exception in some high-production environments," the study contends.

As a result, there has been an increase in grain yield and millions of hectares of "natural ecosystems" have been saved from cultivation for grain production. These include millions of hectares of forests and other natural ecosystems, Reynolds and colleagues found.

Equally promising is the discovery in some experimental wheat lines incorporating wild traits that show up to 20 percent more growth under heat and drought conditions when compared to current varieties, and the development of the first crop ever bred to interact with soil microbes that has shown potential in reducing production of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. This enables the plants to use nitrogen more efficiently.

"The use of PGR wild relatives, landraces, and isolated breeding gene pools has had substantial impacts on wheat breeding for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses while increasing nutritional value, end-use quality, and grain yield," the review further finds.

Without the use of PGR-derived disease resistance, fungicide use to fight fungal diseases, the main threat to the crop, would have easily doubled, massively increasing selection pressure that would come with the need to avoid fungicide resistance, the review finds.

Remarkably, it is estimated that in wheat, a billion litres of fungicide application have been avoided, saving farmers billions that would go into the purchase and application of the chemicals, it adds.

The authors note that as weather becomes more extreme, crop breeding gene pools will need to be further enriched with new adaptive traits coming from PGR to survive the vagaries of climate change.

These 'definitely' include stubborn diseases that have plagued wheat farming in the tropics, such as the Ug99, a devastating stem rust fungal disease that, at its worst, wipes out entire crops in Africa and parts of the Middle East, Reynolds said.

Modern crop breeding, it says, has largely focused on a relatively narrow pool of star athletes--elite crop varieties that are already high performers and that have known, predictable genetics.

The genetic diversity of wild wheat relatives, on the other hand, offers complex climate-resilient traits that have been harder to use because they take longer, cost more, and are riskier than the traditional breeding methods used for elite varieties.

"We have the tools to quickly explore genetic diversity that was previously inaccessible to breeders," explains Benjamin Kilian, co-author of the review and coordinator of the Crop Trust's Biodiversity for Opportunities, Livelihoods and Development (BOLD) project, that supports conservation and use of crop diversity globally.

Among the tools are next-generation gene sequencing, big-data analytics, and remote sensing technologies, including satellite imagery. The latter allows researchers to routinely monitor traits like plant growth rate or disease resistance at unlimited numbers of sites globally.

While the collection and storage of PGR since early in the 20th century have played a key role, especially in breeding of disease-resistant plant varieties, the study concludes that a massive potential remains unexploited.

With wild relative varieties having survived millions of years of climate variance compared with our relatively recent crop species, more systematic screening is recommended to identify new and better sources of needed traits not just for wheat but for other crops as well, the study advises.

It calls for more investments in studying resilient wild varieties of common crops, taking advantage of widely available, proven and non-controversial technologies that present multiple impacts and a substantial return on investment.

"With new technologies emerging all the time to facilitate their use in plant breeding, PGR should be considered the best bet for achieving climate resilience, including its biotic and abiotic components," the authors said.

HD 	SADC Summit Demands U.S.$5 Trillion Climate Reparations From Global North

The SADC People's Summit, a gathering of civil society organizations, community leaders, and citizens from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, has issued a resounding call for a robust, equitable, and just climate debt policy.

This policy would require developed countries in the Global North to pay US$5 trillion annually to the Global South for climate change mitigation.

TD 
	

The summit, held concurrently with the official SADC Heads of State Summit, focused on the theme "Reclaiming SADC for People's Development: Building People Power, Voice, and Agency towards Democracy and Inclusion."

During a dedicated climate change session on Thursday, seasoned civil society leader and human rights defender Sydney Chisi emphasized the urgent need for a climate debt policy that acknowledges the historical responsibility of developed nations for the climate crisis.

Chisi underscored the stark disparity between the Global North and South, highlighting how Western industrialization over the past 300 years has disproportionately contributed to greenhouse gas emissions while reaping immense economic benefits.

Developing countries, on the other hand, are bearing the brunt of climate change impacts despite having minimal contributions to the crisis.

"The fundamental aspect that we need to understand is that climate debt and climate justice aspects require one fundamental thing, change, not only change as an in our appreciation of climate change but also we need to offer and profer leadership as civil societies and also as governments.

"To say, how do we identify the enemy who has made is to be where we are right now," said Chisi.

"The first understanding we need to look at the present moment, is that we faced with two emerging crises within the world and those two emerging crises are one, climate change at one end and also the emerging and extension of debt in itself.

"If you look at the Global South countries, at the end of the day you will find out that history has taken us to an understanding that for 300 years of industrialisation the Global North has been emitting unabated without any mitigation strategy," added Chisi.

Chisi argued that the Global North's claim of insufficient resources for development and climate finance is fundamentally and disingenuous.

During Covid-19 pandemic, the Global North governments mobilized an astounding US$16 trillion in fiscal stimulus to support their economies.

Additionally the G7 spent over US$1 trillion annually funding wars and conflicts globally.

Chisi, said this clearly demonstrates that the resources exist and they are just being allocated based on political will and priorities.

"If trillions can be found for pandemic relief and military expenditures, the same financial commitment must be made to address the existential threat of climate change," said Chisi.

"And they (Global North) have built up their economies not only on emissions but based on cheap labour that was coming from the Global South and now we have moved so many years later we are now beginning to feel the impact.

"However, when it comes to issues of adaptation, when it comes to issues of resilience building you will find that the Global North is much ready than all of us.

Chisi cited the devastating impacts of climate-related disasters such as Cyclone Idai in 2018 and the 2022 Durban floods, which disproportionately affected SADC countries.

He contrasted these experiences with the relatively mild climate impacts felt in developed nations, emphasizing the gross inequity in vulnerability and resilience.

"Go back to 2018 cyclone Idai, it hit Malawi, it hit Zimbabwe and it hit Mozambique," said Chisi.

"The rain bomb in Durban of 2022, all those effects were never felt in London, I mean when you look at those news and people are complaining in Europe saying its hot, what are the temperatures it's 35 degrees.

"I mean go to Beitbridge, go to the limpopo region, go to Churundi, those are the daily temperatures to which people live with.

"But the moment that temperatures in Europe get to 35 degrees there is whole Global panic, it's like the whole world is burning, so that they need the money to ensure that they can cover themselves and we can't," said Chisi.

HD 	Cosatu Supports the Call On Glencore to Stop Sending Coal to Israel - Fuelling Apartheid and Genocide Is a Crime!

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) supports the global call by working class and international solidarity organisations to stop the energy lifeline for the apartheid state of Israel.

Israel relies on energy, coal in particular, from three countries, globally. These are Colombia, Russia and South Africa. Colombia, in brave act of decisiveness and solidarity, suspended all coal exports to Israel. We are inspired by our Colombian comrades for this great act of true solidarity and internationalism.

TD 
	

We note that Glencore is part of a global cartel involved in facilitating coal exports to Israel, which fuels the genocidal crimes by the Netanyahu regime against the Palestinian people.

This is part of a plan by a few multinational companies to control global energy markets and therefore, determine the development prospects of different countries and regions of the world. Africa is not part of that future development trajectory they are imposing.

We support our affiliate, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) for its principled stand in demanding the prioritisation of South Africa's growing energy needs and those of the African continent towards industrialisation, job creation and equitable development.

COSATU further calls on Glencore and other South African companies involved in the shipping of coal and other exports, to immediately work on alternative energy markets that prioritise the development needs of our global south partners.

The reproduction of the global energy economy based on the interests of imperialism and few monopolies keep Africa and the global south industrially dependent and underdeveloped.

The struggle for the democratisation of global energy ownership and control is important to workers and for the end to the raging wars of energy conquest waged by multinational elites in search for profits.

The war on Gaza, as well as various other wars, are directly related to the desperation for energy control by the monopolies. This is why the struggle for a free Palestine is at the same time a struggle for a new, just and democratic economic model of development for humanity as a whole.

COSATU's call remains, total divestment in apartheid Israel and more investment on the pressing energy and developmental needs of Africa and the global south.

The Minister of Agriculture, Climate Change and Environment of Seychelles, Flavien Joubert, will represent Seychelles in the 3rd Voice of Global South Summit (VOGSS) on August 17, 2024, to be hosted by India in the virtual format.

This unique initiative began as an extension of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's vision of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas aur Sabka Prayas', and is underpinned by India's philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. It envisages bringing together countries of the Global South to share their perspectives and priorities on a common platform across a whole range of issues.

TD 
	

India hosted the 1st Voice of Global South Summit (VOGSS) on January 12-13, 2023, and the 2nd Voice of Global South Summit on November 17, 2023, both in virtual format. Both the previous editions of the Summit saw the participation of over 100 countries from the Global South, including Seychelles. The inputs and feedback received from the leaders of the developing countries in these two Summits were appropriately reflected in the agenda and discussions of the G-20 Summit under India's Presidency last year, including in the G-20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration.

The 3rd VOGSS, with the overarching theme of "An Empowered Global South for a Sustainable Future", will act as a platform to expand discussions held in the previous Summits on a range of complex challenges that continue to affect the world, such as conflicts, food and energy security crises, climate change - all of which disproportionately affect developing countries in a severe manner. At the Summit, the countries of the Global South would continue deliberations on challenges, priorities, and solutions for the Global South, particularly in the developmental domain.

Similar to the previous two Summits, the 3rd VOGSS will be held in a virtual format and is structured into Leaders' Session and Ministerial sessions. The inaugural session will be at the Head of State/Government level and will be hosted by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The theme of the Inaugural Leaders' Session is the same as the overarching theme of the Summit "An Empowered Global South for a Sustainable Future".

In addition, there will be 10 ministerial sessions, including the Energy Ministers' Session on "Sustainable Energy Solutions for a Sustainable Future". Minister Joubert will participate in the Energy Ministers' Session. He also participated in the first and second VOGSS in January and November 2023.

HD 	China Escalates Its Political Party Training in Africa

China promotes its dominant party model in Africa through a suite of training programs for government and party officials. While popular with some ruling party officials, this model is antithetical to Africans' preference for multiparty, participatory democracy.

A ubiquitous Chinese government talking point is the principle of non-interference in other countries. This includes issues of governance where China has long claimed that it does not export its model or encourage foreign nations to emulate its practices.

TD 
	

Yet, this is rapidly changing in China's engagements in Africa. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has escalated its training of African party and government officials as part of Xi Jinping's "new model of party-to-party relations," particularly in the Global South. An indication of this renewed emphasis is the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Leadership School. Launched in 2022, the Nyerere School trains ruling party members from the Former Liberation Movements of Southern Africa (FLMSA) coalition--Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.

China has built or supported African party schools going back to the 1960s. However, the Nyerere School is the first to be modeled after the CCP Central Party School, which trains China's top cadres and leaders. It is also the first of its kind to cater to multiple African political parties. This school parallels the China-Africa Institute, a continental CCP initiative to train African party and government leaders. The Institute, which started in 2019, is based within the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing and the African Union (AU) in Addis Ababa.

CCP-supported governance and party training also occurs at the national level as illustrated by the refurbishment of the Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology, the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party school, completed in 2023.

China's party and governance training has the potential to entrench single, dominant party models in Africa.

Less noticeable are the non-brick-and-mortar schools of China's National Academy of Governance (CAG), the external name for the CCP's Central Party School. Algeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa are among the African countries whose governance academies maintain year-round training partnerships with CAG. China's party exchanges have increased alongside this expanding training. China is expected to receive over 50 African party delegations this year--double the number of party visits hosted in 2015.

While often overlooked in discussions of party training, Chinese government institutions also run programs in Africa (and the Global South more generally) on "sharing governance experience in governing state affairs" (fen xiang zhiguo li zheng jin yang; 分享治国理政经验) that mirror the CCP initiatives. Many of these trainings place emphasis on party supremacy over the state and government, a concept that is at odds with the multiparty democratic framework required by most African constitutions and AU conventions. Notably, CCP party schools are embedded in the structure of China's government institutes.

China's constitution describes the government as a "people's democratic dictatorship." This oxymoronic framing is an anchor concept that runs through the CCP's entire suite of political trainings. It is popular with African ruling parties intent on extending their longevity. According to the head of one African government training school, "They [CCP] show us what they achieved without the messiness of democracy."

Despite its economic growth, China's political model has not been something to which many African citizens aspire. Nearly 80 percent reject one-party rule. Yet, as many African scholars argue, China's party and governance training has the potential to entrench single, dominant party models in Africa. The CCP's foreign training programs are also heavily oriented towards elite capture. National elites, in turn, are keen to use their ties to China to entrench their rule. This escalation in CCP party training is happening against the backdrop of major democratic setbacks in Africa in recent years.

Advancing China's Dominant Party Model in Africa

The blurred line between the CCP and the Chinese state mirrors the situation in parts of Africa where the interests of the ruling party are self-interestedly conflated with those of the state. China has many venues to advance its governance philosophy and practice. Between 2012 and 2019, the CCP conducted 368 exchanges with African parties (257 in China and 111 in Africa), according to the CCP's International Department's metadata.

The CCP has ongoing relations with 110 African ruling and opposition parties, 35 parliaments, and 59 politically oriented organizations, including party think tanks. In 2017, Xi directed the CCP to conduct 15,000 exchanges globally over the next 5 years, driving it to tap into its vast network of over 3,000 political schools, some of which have subsequently established their own training programs in Africa. CCP training also occurs via state agencies like the Academy for International Business Officials (AIBO) in the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). AIBO is China's flagship foreign training institute, which works closely with the MOFCOM CCP Central Party School.

Participants in the AIBO training system must be citizens of developing countries. Scholarships for graduate studies in government are given to candidates under 45 years of age, highlighting China's interest in shaping younger generations of party and government leaders. Nearly all 21,123 AIBO government and ruling party trainees between 2021 and 2022 were from developing countries, with about a third from Africa.

There has been strong demand for CCP engagement from some African ruling parties. The decision to establish the Nyerere School was taken at the 2016 FLMSA Heads of State Summit. Tanzania, which was chosen as the venue, played a major role in securing the CCP's support. The Chitepo School was revived in 2016, having been disbanded at Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, with construction beginning in 2021. China's stepped-up support for the local party schools of the six FLMSA countries was also undertaken on the initiative of the parties concerned.

Xi's directive to expand party training, in short, has been advanced in four ways in Africa:

*liiitag The resumption of party school construction

*liiitag "Brainstorming summits" for party leaders, like the CCP and World Political Parties Summit and the Beijing International Forum for Democracy

*liiitag CCP briefing delegations

*liiitag Support for African governance academies

The "brainstorming summits" assemble 300-500 political party leaders globally every 1-2 years--a venue for China to win support for its governance concepts among foreign political parties. The CCP and World Political Parties Summit sponsors an Africa Thematic Event that Tanzania hosted when the gathering first met in 2018. The CCP briefing delegations consist of top CCP leaders sent to brief their foreign equivalents about the outcomes of major CCP meetings. These include the CCP's annual plenum, which maps out China's overall strategic direction.

What Exactly is China's Governance Model?

China's governance system has four dominant features: party supremacy, fragmented authoritarianism, political meritocracy, and party-led economic governance.

Party supremacy is the most attractive feature for many ruling parties in Africa. A major study of 71 African political parties found that "The [African] party in power is hardly autonomous from government influence and it is difficult to draw the line between where the influence of government begins and that of political party ends."

China's model of fragmented authoritarianism gives significant autonomy to lower state structures as long as they do not deviate from party control. Hence the regime can rally around a "strong leader," dispense patronage, and prevent alternative power centers from forming, a disposition many patronage-laden African systems share with China.

China likes to call itself a "political meritocracy," that favors effective, technocratic government and claims legitimacy by equating democracy and human rights with economic development. This explains why the Chinese concept of democracy is married to China's economic achievements. African leaders make similar arguments. As Rwanda's President Paul Kagame explains, "There is nothing like human rights minus ... development. These are human rights: development, schools, education, health, and food security." Left unstated in this argument is that autocratic governance has been a major source of instability in Africa. Many top African development thinkers, moreover, note that economic development without democracy is ultimately unsustainable as it exacerbates societal cleavages, institutionalizes corruption and party privilege, and ignores the social roots of conflict.

China's rekindled interest in African party schools is also something of a marketing endeavor. After the Nyerere and Chitepo schools opened, many approached the CCP to build their schools and enhance their party building, including Burundi, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Morocco, and Uganda.

Even Kenya's United Democratic Alliance (UDA) has requested the CCP to build its new party headquarters, leadership school, and Kenya's new foreign ministry building. China seems to be following the model it used in Ghana where, since 2018, it has provided successive Ghanaian ruling parties political leadership training. The dalliance of Kenyan and Ghanaian parties with the CCP offers glimpses into how China seeks to engage and reshape governance norms even in more pluralistic and open contexts.

The CCP prizes regular contact, replication, and critical mass. Three parties, Tanzania's Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), South Africa's African National Congress (ANC), and Zimbabwe's ZANU-PF collectively trained over 900 cadres in China between 2000 and 2022. Over the same period, China conducted exchanges, party building, and training with every African ruling party apart from Eswatini's. The China-Africa Institute has trained 348 party and state officials through the Ethiopian, Kenyan, and South African governance academies alone.

The China National Academy of Government (CCP Central Party School) has trained 400 Algerian ruling party and government officials since 2015 and run similar programs for Egypt, Tunisia, and South Africa. As leading China scholar, Yun Sun, explains, the CCP's party-to-party work is "geographically expansive, institutionally systematic, and psychologically and politically impactful over the choices and preferences of African political parties and, thus, over the African political landscape."

CCP Training Packages for African Political Parties

Implications for African Citizen Agency

Africa's pro-democracy voices and civil society leaders consider the CCP's enhanced party engagements as directly hostile to Africa's democratic project. Many of the CCP's partners share anti-democratic features like highly personalized political institutions and little to no accountability, even though China's employment-generating economic programs remain popular. China is therefore viewed as a negative actor for Africans' democratic aspirations. It should be recalled that Africa's experience with single-party rule was almost uniformly negative, explaining the popular groundswell of pro-democracy movements that spearheaded the collapse of one-party states during the 1990's transition to multiparty politics.

Africa's experience with single-party rule was almost uniformly negative.

Those who question African ruling parties' embrace of China's party training are often dismissed as "Western puppets." Africa's democracy proponents strongly push back on this characterization, however. "It is Africans themselves who long for democracy," says scholar Tafi Mhaka. This is supported by polling. Afrobarometer finds that nearly 70 percent of Africans surveyed prefer democracy to any other type of government. Roughly 80 percent reject one-party rule. China's dominant single-party system, therefore, runs diametrically counter to African citizen interests.

A growing number of voices also take issue with Africa's assumed position as a "perennial student" of foreign powers. Africa possesses a wealth of noteworthy experience that it can teach others such as negotiating political disputes, reaching out to former enemies, and upholding democratic processes even if it means losing power as many African parties have done. Rather than a weakness, such features are healthy attributes of democratic self-correction and accountability--guarding against corruption and abuses of power.

For Africa's democracy advocates, such attributes are worth defending and vital to Africa achieving both the freedoms and prosperity that its citizens desire. This, too. is supported by experience. Africa's authoritarian governments are linked to three-fourths of the continent's conflicts, 80 percent of its forcibly displaced populations, and 85 percent of the acute food insecurity in Africa. Africa's consolidating democracies, meanwhile, typically generate two-thirds more rapid economic growth, realize higher educational attainment levels, have lower infant and child mortality rates, and longer life expectancies.

Disconnect between Ruling Parties and Citizen Interests

There is a disconnect between the trajectory certain African ruling parties would like to follow and the democratic path desired by citizens and enshrined in constitutions. While some African ruling parties may try to dress this up, their enthusiasm to train with the CCP is essentially about (re)normalizing dominant single-party systems. These forces are on the ascendant as the CCP sees ramped-up party training as a key lever of influence and some ruling parties see it as a means of justifying their hold on power indefinitely.

HD 	South Africa's Foreign Policy - a Unity Government Must Be Practical in a Turbulent World

As South Africa navigates fundamental political change, it faces stark choices on foreign policy posture and priorities. The change has been brought about by the African National Congress's loss of electoral majority, forcing it into a unity government.

TD 
	

Based on my work over many years on South Africa's foreign policy as well as reflections on the country's role in Africa and the global south, I argue that the unity government must take a more nuanced approach to international relations.

This approach must be based on a shared world view. Developing that world view may prove difficult because unity government members range from social democratic to liberal and conservative positions.

The key will be strong ethical leadership to play a credible "middle power" role in global affairs. In my view, President Cyril Ramaphosa is such a leader. He helped rebuild South Africa's international standing and role after Jacob Zuma's corrosive presidency, which was marked by state capture.

The African National Congress and the Democratic Alliance - the two largest parties in the unity government - have already determined the broad outlines of what appears to be a centrist policy framework. The unity government's "basic minimum programme" of priorities says foreign policy will be:

... based on human rights, constitutionalism, the national interest, solidarity, peaceful resolution of conflicts, to achieve the African Agenda 2063, South-South, North-South and African cooperation, multilateralism and a just, peaceful and equitable world.

The document's framing language and the foreign policy section are constitutionally oriented. This is positive. However, the section is written in a bland, technical style that's deliberately vague. Perhaps that's to allow for follow-up negotiations.

Six priorities ought to be in the inbox of the newly appointed foreign minister representing the interests of the country and Africa. These call for pragmatism among the unity government partners.

1. Define the national interest

The new decision-makers must avoid serving a narrow political or economic class. South Africa's constitutional values and the National Development Plan should guide them.

Facing rapid social and economic changes as well as conflict, the unity government must immediately adopt a framework for foreign and security policy. A good start would be to review the proposed national security strategy.

2. Implement the African agenda

Three related themes define South Africa's contribution to the advancement of Africa:

*liiitag promoting democratic governance: by strengthening a culture of democratic decision-making and accountability

*liiitag enhancing inclusive growth and sustainable development: by following the African Union's Agenda 2063, which includes the continental free trade agreement

*liiitag advancing peace and security: by strengthening Africa's approach to peace-building and making sure the guns fall silent by 2030.

South Africa's decision-makers and diplomats must be attuned to political, economic, security and social developments among its neighbours, and the rest of the continent.

They must be aware of the dynamic nature of South Africa's relations with Africa. They must stand ready to explore opportunities for the continent's development and address issues that undermine its interests and harm its people.

Part of this commitment is ensuring that Africa's institutions of governance work better. These are

*liiitag the African Union

*liiitag regional economic communities

*liiitag African peace and security architecture

*liiitag African governance architecture.

3. Promote the interests of the global south

In 2010 South Africa joined the Brazil, Russia and India (Bric) alliance. In 2023 it hosted a successful Brics summit at which membership enlargement was agreed.

This emerging Brics+ configuration has the potential to shape the future of the institutions of global governance. This is necessary to limit the often harmful influence of several western-led centres of power: the so-called P3 UN Security Council (United States, United Kingdom and France), the Group of Seven, the Group of 20, the international financial institutions and the World Economic Forum.

The unity government must use robust diplomacy to advance South Africa, Africa and the global south's prospects. Instead of aligning with either west or east, it must foster a deeper understanding of the Brics+ alliance, and define South Africa's place in it.

4. Recovery of the institutions of global governance

The United Nations system has increasingly been unable to carry out its mandate. This might be due to internal inefficiencies but also superpower rivalry - the bitter contest for global dominance between the US-led west and an increasingly confident Chinese-led group of nations. Or a return of "cold war" dynamics.

South Africa, the continent and the global south depend on the efficient and effective execution of the UN's mandate. The country's diplomats must make efforts to protect and enhance the UN's role, and not obsess over the need to reform the Security Council.

5. Reform of the international financial architecture

Global south countries broadly agree on the need for reform of the international financial architecture, anchored by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

Historical and recent financial shocks have revealed vulnerabilities in the system. This validates the call for a system that is more responsive to change, and which provides greater equity in process and outcome. South African diplomats must be skilled or upskilled to participate in these reform processes.

6. Professionalise the foreign ministry

In 2019, a ministerial task team made recommendations to improve training and education. Many of them remain untouched.

Given the challenges and potential opportunities facing the country, the report's recommendations must be carried out. Foreign policy decision-makers must use the wealth of expertise in academia, NGOs, think-tanks and the private sector in undertaking this task.

The foreign policy research community must work with the unity government to build a cohort of professional, patriotic diplomats, including trade and defence attachés. They must engage South Africa's traditional and new partners without forgetting their African identity and the obligations it brings as the country seeks to realise the vision of the African Union: an integrated continent, prosperous and peaceful, and a meaningful actor on the international stage.

Need for pragmatism

Overall, one hopes that the parties forming the unity government will be pragmatic rather than stick to their ideological preferences. By drawing on the best talents the nation has to offer, a unity government will be able to restore political credibility at home, and carry out a transformative agenda with poverty alleviation at the centre.

The term "Global South" first appeared in 1969 in an article by political activist Carl Oglesby in the liberal Catholic journal "Commonweal". Oglesby argued that the Vietnam War was the culmination of a history of "Northern domination of the Global South." The term gained further prominence in 1980 with the report "North-South: A Program for Survival," issued by an independent commission headed by former German Chancellor Willy Brandt. It was also featured in the 1990 report "The Challenge to the South: The Report of the South Commission," issued by a UN commission led by Julius Nyerere, then-President of Tanzania. However, it only became widely recognized after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, marking the end of the so-called "Second World."

TD 
	

In the latter half of the 20th century, groups such as the Non-Aligned Movement, founded in 1961, and the G-77, established within the United Nations in 1964, sought to promote the collective interests of the world's poorest countries, newly freed from the heavy shackles of colonialism in a world dominated by former imperial powers.

The term "Global South" refers to various countries around the globe located primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. It denotes a mixture of political, geopolitical, and shared economic elements between these nations. These countries are often described as "developing," "less developed," "underdeveloped," or "Third World." However, these latter terms are gradually being replaced by "Global South" due to their pejorative connotations.

In general, these countries are poorer, have relatively low levels of socioeconomic and industrial development, experience higher levels of income inequality, and suffer from lower life expectancy and harsher living conditions compared to the countries of the so-called "Global North." The Global North primarily includes the richest nations located in North America and Europe, with some additions from the geographical South, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.

The countries of the Global South, many of which have been tragic victims of imperialism, colonial rule, and extensive economic, social, and political influence from powerful Western countries, represent over 85 percent of the world's population and close to 40 percent of the world's GDP.

- Advertisement -Since the beginning of the 21st century, there has been a notable shift of wealth from the North Atlantic to Asia and the Pacific, as highlighted by the World Bank. By 2030, it is predicted that three of the four largest economies will be in the Global South: China, India, and Indonesia, alongside the United States.

The GDP relative to purchasing power of nations in the BRICS group--Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran--already exceeds that of the G7 group of the Global North.

The term "Global South," which is not strictly geographical (e.g., China, India, and Mexico are in the Northern Hemisphere), has once again been brought to the fore by the reluctance of many leading countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to align with NATO in the ongoing war in Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. This war has cast a spotlight on the Global South as an important factor in geopolitics.

There is no doubt that the term "Global South" is an important unifying phrase. It embodies a strong sense of dissatisfaction with established international institutions that reflect the geopolitical and economic interests of Western countries.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sharply brought to the surface the accumulated global anger towards the West, stemming from years of colonialism and neo-colonial practices, as well as the double standards with which Western countries address human rights violations in various parts of the world.

The countries of the Global South overwhelmingly did not impose sanctions on Russia, a non-Western member of the Global North. Some nations have even increased their trade with Moscow, significantly undermining the effectiveness of Western sanctions. For instance, in 2022, Russia's trade with the United Arab Emirates increased by 68 percent, and with India by an impressive 205 percent.

At the same time, most countries of the Global South criticize Israel, viewing the conflict in Gaza as an extension of Israeli occupation, the oppression of Palestinians, and the selective application of international law. Due to their own histories, many people in Africa and Latin America interpret these events through a post-colonial lens.

South Africa, one of the most economically powerful and modernized states in Africa, and therefore a model and spokesperson for many states on the continent, has adopted an extremely critical stance towards Israel, condemning the killing of innocent civilians. Argentina, across the Atlantic, condemned the attacks by Israeli armed forces on civilian infrastructure and called for the observance of international humanitarian law.

The Global South, therefore, presents itself as the primary opportunity for resistance among its member countries, inspired by an anti-colonial and anti-imperialist worldview, against the "new order" that the US and other powerful Western economies are vigorously promoting. The Global South simultaneously displays political and economic power that the "developing countries" and the "Third World" never possessed.

Some of these states are critical sources of mineral resources, supply chains, and sometimes innovations necessary for global development, giving them more influence than they had in the twentieth century.

Consequently, we see leaders passionately embrace this term. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has previously stated that his country has become "the voice of the Global South," while South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has expressed his aim to advance "the Global South agenda."

In closing, the anti-internationalist camp of countries, known as the Global South, is growing stronger and more resilient, not yielding to the will of the rich countries of the internationalist West. This marks a transition from a unipolar world dominated by the US and its allies to a multipolar world.

BRICS is more than an acronym!

TD 
	

At a time when many Western economies in the Eurozone and the United States are countenancing economic power stagnation or decline, huge debts and stunted growth, the BRICS countries have emerged as the southern engines of global growth.

In the arsenal of these countries are the majority of the world's population and an increasingly weighty share of the world economy.

The alliance members possess nuclear capabilities and have vibrant ongoing space programmes. In the coalition is India, the world's largest democracy, Russia the world's largest country and China, the world's second biggest economy.

Above all, Brazil as a member of the alliance has 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest and is the record-holder of the men's FIFA World Cup competition. The same alliance has a claim to the world's largest diamond and longest wine route in South Africa.

Traditionally, BRICS has been a formal title of a planned and structured economic coalition of five great and high-profile leading emerging market economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

Now referred to as the BRICS+, the coalition has 10 countries, having admitted Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in January.

The alliance consists three African countries, three Middle-East and Persian countries (all key oil producers), two Asian economic power houses, one European great power and one South American economic giant.

Though consisting of different civilisations where each member state plays a critical role in the global system, it will never be right to have this important grouping only visible in media debates than in practical international politics.

The last members to be admitted brought in the alliance their own strategic value and the inclusion of major oil producers (Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the UAE) marked a pivotal shift in the global energy dynamics.

This triad of sovereign states is now potentially reshaping foreign policies, economic interests and even influencing the market dynamics of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In this strategic alliance there is a reflection of historic relationships.

Reflectively, Egypt and Ethiopia's entry into BRICS also added a new dimension to the alliance's expansion and reach in Africa. Both Egypt and Ethiopia are pivotal in regional politics and trade in the continent, and their membership enhances intra-BRICS+ collaboration in Africa.

The goal in this is to end poverty in its form, content and character, which for most nations in the global South is a man-made phenomenon resulting from colonialism that created unequal power levers.

Therefore, the poverty that BRICS+ and global South nations are fighting ought to be seen in the context or result of human rights violations by the West and as a flagrant violation of such rights for a sizable segment of the global populace, the most of whom are women and children in the South.

A growing number of global South nations and citizens are now agreeing that the current state of poverty is not the result of chance events or historical circumstances.

Nelson Mandela is frequently cited advocating for the following viewpoint: "Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justice. Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings."

Of late, Zimbabwe's pieces on the economic and geopolitical chessboard have placed strategic importance on the country's bid for admission into the BRICS' New Development Bank, and ultimately become a BRICS+ member and overcome poverty.

According to the 2023 BRICS Johannesburg Declaration II, the bloc underlined its "support for a more democratic and just multi-polar world order based on the rule of international law, equality, mutual respect, cooperation, coordinated action and collective decision-making of all states."

These principles hold particularly in dealings with African countries, many whose sovereignty has not been respected in the past, especially by colonial powers.

It therefore means that one of the criteria for a prospective BRICS member state explicitly requires that the nation must be in favour of multilateralism and comprehensive United Nations (UN) reform.

Zimbabwe does favour multilateralism and has frequently called for a comprehensive reform of the UN, hence it will not try to run before it can walk. Its first steps are to join the New Development Bank.

The nation's decision to join the BRICS' New Development Bank, which Russia has supported, is a compelling strategic manoeuvre aimed at countering Western economic sanctions and to strengthen economic ties with key emerging markets.

This move by Zimbabwe is also directed at diversifying its economic partners and reducing its reliance on Western economic and financial systems because the combined policies of the Bretton Woods institutions have had a pernicious impact on the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans.

As a potential member, Zimbabwe is coming to the table to broaden multipolarity at a time the BRICS countries now make up more of the world's gross domestic product (GDP) than the US, meaning economically they are stronger than the USA when they come together.

By joining the BRICS bank, Zimbabwe is set for a possibility to get access to financial resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects to spur national development and growth.

To match its diplomatic efforts and deeds, Zimbabwe over the past seven years of its re-engagement and engagement has been pivoting towards the Middle-East by opening embassies in Türkiye, Saudi Arabia and the UAE in 2019, 2023 and 2024, respectively. All this signals the importance of diplomatic contact.

Zimbabwe has significantly remained in the trade and investment orbit of BRICS countries. The 2023 report by the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZimStat) confirms that. Zimbabwe's 2023 top three export destinations were South Africa, the UAE and China, while major import source countries were South Africa and China.

The awakening of the BRICS+ countries and potential members comes at a time they have increasingly integrated their national economies into the global economic system. The impact is that the economic wealth of these countries has grown relatively due to a well-educated middle class that has flourished in the new information economy.

Our world is witnessing a rising alternative centre of global influence that is against "the use of unilateral coercive measures, which are incompatible with the principles of the Charter of the UN and produce negative effects notably in the developing world."

Because the BRICS+ and the New Development Bank are against conflict, it therefore translates that Western (if they mean it) and BRICS companies need each other, in good times and in bad.

There is need for all nations to co-exist, even though the vocabulary of co-existence rarely appears in Western literature in international relations because the West's obsession with exceptionalism sees the concept as the brainchild of the communist Eastern bloc, hence continue to be immersed in ideological rivalry.

Simply put, co-existence under BRICS is fundamental to neutralise the competitive dynamics that the West has unilaterally imposed over the past few years. What the world is seeing is an introduction of some measure of great power coordination in globally contested issues.

Co-existence is a key component of the BRICS vision, since each member is a proponent for the establishment of a global order that includes cooperatively managing challenges and concerns together through peaceful means.

HD 	Nasarawa Lithium Mining Is Repeating Niger Delta Oil Exploration Havoc - Environmental Activists

Environmental rights activists have, again, raised the alarm over what they described as the "lithium curse" looming in Nigeria, reminiscent of the "oil curse" that has damaged the Niger Delta region.

They stressed that as lithium is driving the renewable energy vision of the world, the transition might spell doom for communities rich in the mineral.

TD 
	

The rights advocates spoke today, Wednesday, May 29, at a webinar on Just Transition, with the topic, "Voices from Mining Communities".

They stressed that Just Transition is not the expansion of mining sites in Africa, but ensuring a fair and equitable transition for all stakeholders involved.

The event, which had activists from across Africa in attendance, was organised by Community Development Advocacy Foundation, CODAF; Renevlyn Development Initiative, RDI, and Global Alliance for Incinerators Alternative, GAIA, members in Nigeria.

In Nasarawa

Recall that in October last year, President Bola Tinubu carried out a groundbreaking ceremony to commence the construction of a $250 million lithium factory in Nasarawa State.

However, speaking at today's discourse, Philip Jakpor, Executive Director of RDI, noted that no community representative is ever invited to any meeting concerning the minerals in their soil.

He said: "The miners and the environment is a crime scene. There are also some unsavory developments in that community - a growing number of kids are recruited to mine and the girls are becoming sex slaves for the miners.

"In every community, and around every community, where lithium is mined in Nigeria, there are Chinese companies and there is insecurity. They deliberately created insecurity in the mining communities, allowing the miners to get away with their environmental and other crimes.

"The requisite monitoring and oversight are largely missing.

"And let's not forget that lithium is driving the renewable energy vision of the world. A metric ton of lithium in the international market is about $100,000 per metric ton, up from about $30,000 a year ago."

Conversely, he noted, in the state of California (USA), for every ton of lithium extracted, there is a California Lithium Extraction Tax of between $400 and $800 that goes back to the local community for sustainability and other useful purposes.

Solutions

On his part, Ubrei-Joe Maimoni, member of the Global Advisory Hub, GAIA, and Co-Founder of CODAF. outlined how the situation can be remedied.

He said: "While the demand for minerals is driven by the energy transition in developed countries, many communities in the Global South lack access to clean energy.

"The transition must address this inequity and ensure that the benefits of renewable energy are shared equitably, particularly with those bearing the brunt of mining impacts."

Indigenous rights and community consent, provision of stringent regulations and accountability, equitable access to clean energy, and robust environmental protections are some of the principles he suggested.

"By prioritizing these principles, the transition to renewable energy can be achieved without replicating the injustices and environmental destruction of the fossil fuel era," Maimoni added.

GAIA Africa

Speaking on 'Transition to Renewable Energies (EV, Solar, Wind) Without Digging More Pits,' Kenza Elazkem, North Africa Outreach Coordinator, GAIA Africa, said that beyond the issues of poor regulations in Africa, critical minerals like lithium are only critical to the Global North.

She said they would rather extract them from the Global South where regulations are weak.

Elazkem revealed that the energy transition model currently being promoted by the Global North will push about three million Electronic Vehicles batteries to Africa by 2050, including batteries that will cause public health hazards.

"So there will be waste colonialism with EV batteries," she warned.

She revealed also that batteries produced for the Global South are not of the same standards and quality as those of the Global North.

"Because of that, GAIA is promoting campaigns to refuse products designed for waste and reduce the use of critical minerals among others," Elazkem added.

Other rights activists who spoke were Benin Richard, Executive Director of CODAF; Dr. Leslie Adogame, representative of GAIA members in Nigeria; Farai Maguwu, Executive Director of Centre for Natural Resources Governance, CNRG, Zimbabwe; Tobias Lengs Dapam - Board Member, RDI and anti-mining community campaigner, and Tobias Lengs Dapam, board member, RDI, and anti-mining community campaigner.

Marina Agortimevour, Coordinator, Africa Coal Network, was the facilitator/moderator.

HD 	Mrs Tinubu and the Blood-Stained Hands of Israeli Envoys

A few days ago, a major national daily published on its front cover a photograph of two Israeli envoys - Ambassador Michael Freeman and Deputy Ambassador, Mrs Anbar Lipman Garden, with a caption "a courtesy visit of the envoys to the First Lady at the State House, Abuja".

The stories of the visit as released by the Office of the First Lady have been published earlier in some national newspapers. The Israeli ambassador was quoted to have expressed appreciation for the First Lady's initiative on programs to support women and children. In Gaza, the Israeli regime for whom the diplomat speaks for, women and children are being bombed to smithereens, with their homes, worship places, markets, hospitals turned to their burial grounds.

TD 
	

Certainly, this visit came at a point that Israel is considered an international outlaw, having severally spurned key United Nations resolutions to halt its war of genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza.

So far, Israel has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, among whom are estimated 20, 000 women and children, and the hands Mrs Tinubu has insensitively chosen to shake are dripping with the innocent blood of more than 20,000 women and children of Gaza, whose only offence is being Arab Palestinians. From the reported exchange between Mrs Tinubu and the Israeli envoys, there was no indication that Mrs Tinubu expressed the slightest concerns about the children and women in Gaza, the routine targets of Israeli relentless bombardment and genocidal attack, which has currently escalated with threats to bomb and attack their last refugee camp in Rafah.

The Presidency, for which Mrs Tinubu's Office is an integral part, has again demonstrated insensitivity or even naivety to a crucial international question for which most countries in the Global South have a near consensus. It is ironic to say the least that while Nigeria and other 142 countries at the United Nations General Assembly last week voted to expand Palestinian rights at the international body in clear chastisement of Israeli obstinacy and contempt for international law, norm and practice for which the Israeli UN representative responded by shredding the UN charter. Mrs Tinubu was shaking the blood-stained hands of Israeli diplomats here.

Beyond the moral complicity of Mrs Tinubu and by extension, her husband's presidency in the bloody genocide of the Israeli regime, the government may have damaged the potential gains of its extensive economic diplomacy that President Tinubu has recently undertaken with his high-level meetings in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia which are expected to attract significant investments to Nigeria from these key Arab economic hubs. Receiving Israeli diplomats at the height of Israeli regime's intransigence and total disregard and snub to the sensitivities of her Arab neighbours is an incredibly naïve politics that will have consequences for the government's declared aim of being open to business.

From Ankara (Turkey), Tehran (Iran) to Malaysia, Indonesia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arab, Nigerian Presidency's reckless audacity to hobnob with the Israeli regime, currently at the peak of its murderous and bloody campaign in Gaza, for which women and children are the principal victims, would create a chill and point to a disconnect between policy, decorum and comportment.

Nigeria has a longstanding policy like many African countries which explicitly underlines the two-state solution to the longstanding problem of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The refusal of the Israeli regime to accept or even consider this international consensus on the solution to the conflict which the U.N General Secretary referred to, in one of his major speeches as the trigger for the October 7th Hamas attacks, demonstrates Israel's culpability in the run up to and aftermath of the heinous attack.

It does not stretch the imagination too far that Israel's only security guarantee is a responsible Palestinian state, that will not be held accountable but will exercise authority, including the use of legitimate violence, against outlaws within its jurisdiction. However, the ideological bigotry of Zionism, with its racist exclusion of others, except the "chosen ones" blinds the Israeli regime from a political framework of inclusion and good neighbourliness.

Nigeria's presidency through the office of the First Lady has inserted itself in the vortex of the Israeli self-harmed policy of racist exclusion and arrogance.

At home, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a very divisive and polarizing issue. And with the Israeli regime's campaign of bloody violence in Gaza, broadcast on television screens daily, the First Lady has chosen to trample on the sensitivity of a considerable number of Nigerians who are offended by the extremely murderous campaign of the Israeli regime.

In economic terms, there is nothing Israel can offer to Nigeria now. Abuja's main foreign policy thrust as articulated by the Presidency is to attract investors and a good number of these investments are expected from the Global South, including key Arab economies from the Middle East, which Mrs Tinubu has chosen to thumb their noses.

At a time, Israel's key ally, the United States is threatening to withhold military and other economic assistance to dissuade the regime from further bombardment and attacks at the last major refugee abode of more than a million Palestinians in Rafah, close to the Egyptian border, Mrs Tinubu's embrace of the blood-stained hands of Israeli diplomats sends the wrong signal that we stand with an international pariah, whose diplomats we would have encouraged to purchase a one-way ticket out of our shores.

Mrs Tinubu, by the way, is entitled to her sentiment and even passion but this must not be allowed to intrude into state matters and conflating such sentiment and emotions as state policy, has consequences to cast doubt on the integrity of state policy and undermining its efficacy on other critical sector, especially the imperative for economic recovery which would tap from the goodwill of international investors.

The visit of the Israeli diplomats at this particular time to the Presidency, when other key countries in the Global South are at the forefront of restraining and constraining Israeli genocidal war in Gaza through diverse credible international platforms like the United Nations, International Court of Justice, etc does not endear Nigeria to a trust-worthy leadership role in the Global South and the talk of Nigeria's candidature for the permanent member of the UN Security Council would elicit frowns, if not outright laughter in most capitals of the Global South and even nearer home in Africa.

Mr Onunaiju, a member of a think tank, wrote from the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja

HD 	SBSTTA and SBI - Biodiversity Meetings Crucial for the Global South Begin

More than 1,400 delegates are present at two crucial meetings, where the topic of preserving the planet's ongoing biodiversity for the benefit of humanity is under discussion. Under the spotlight are the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, synthetic biology, the detection and identification of living modified organisms, and, critically, biodiversity and health.

The 26th meeting of the Subsidiary Body of Scientific, Technical, and Technological Advisors (SBSTTA) of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) started in Nairobi, Kenya, on Monday. Over 1,400 delegates, including 600 representing signatories or parties from over 150 countries, are present for the seven-day meeting at the headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). A large number of members from Indigenous Peoples and other observer organizations, including women's groups, are also attending the meetings.

TD 
	

SBSTTA will be followed by the meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI), another subsidiary body of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The SBI will take place from May 20-29 at the same venue.

Opening the meeting on Monday morning, David Cooper, the Acting Executive Secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, called on the delegates for a successful meeting.

"A key part of ensuring the implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework is to monitor the progress and that's why finalizing a monitoring framework includes authenticators for the parties to report on. I would like to give my sincere appreciation to all those working on putting together a comprehensive set of authenticators. I encourage you to make full use of what we have achieved so far and let's make this meeting a success," Cooper said.

IPS, which is exclusively covering the meetings, has insights into the meetings and presents here the brief history of both the meetings and their significance in larger global biodiversity protection, especially in the global south, including the implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), the legally binding international biodiversity treaty adopted by the nations in December 2022

SBSTTA: History, Mandate and Role in the COP

SBSTTA was established 30 years ago, in 1994, as a subsidiary body of the CBD during the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD in Nassau, Bahamas. Article 25 of the CBD, which mandated its creation, tasked it with giving the COP timely advice regarding the application of the Convention.

Since then, SBSTTA 's main role has been providing assessments of scientific, technical, and technological information relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It typically meets once or twice a year to review and assess relevant scientific information, including reports submitted by Parties, relevant organizations, and stakeholders. Its discussions cover a wide range of topics, including biodiversity loss, ecosystem services, invasive species, genetic resources, and biotechnology.

The main output of SBSTTA meetings is a set of recommendations to the COP, which are based on the scientific and technical assessments conducted during its sessions. These recommendations provide guidance to Parties and other stakeholders on key issues related to the implementation of the CBD.

For example, in 2007, SBSTTA recommended that the biodiversity COP consider the potential impacts of synthetic biology on biodiversity and ecosystems and encourage Parties to undertake further research, risk assessments, and regulatory measures to address any potential risks associated with the release of synthetic organisms into the environment.

This recommendation was later taken up by the CBD COP, leading to the adoption of decisions on synthetic biology, including Decision XIII/17, which encouraged Parties to continue their efforts to address the potential positive and negative impacts of synthetic biology on biodiversity, and take a precautionary approach.

A more recent example is the SBSTTA's recommendation from 2018 that the COP should encourage Parties to mainstream biodiversity considerations into sectoral and cross-sectoral policies, plans, and programs, including those pertaining to agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism, energy, and infrastructure.

The CBD COP later agreed with this suggestion, which led to the adoption of decisions and guidelines on mainstreaming biodiversity across sectors. One of these was Decision XIV/4, which asked Parties to do more to mainstream biodiversity into relevant sectors and to encourage synergies between the goals of sustainable development and biodiversity conservation.

SBSTTA and Genetically Modified Mosquitoes

SBSTTA-26 has a large number of issues on its agenda. Most prominent among them are: 1) creating a monitoring framework for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework; 2) synthetic biology; 3) detection and identification of living modified organisms; and 4) biodiversity and health.

It is expected that under the detection and identification of living modified organisms, genetically engineered mosquitoes for Malaria prevention will be discussed. Research on genetically engineered mosquitoes for malaria control has been an area of interest and investigation for several years, although little information is available on it in the public domain.

Scientists in many countries, including in the United States and Brazil, have been exploring various genetic modification techniques to create mosquitoes that are resistant to the malaria parasite or are unable to transmit the disease. One approach involves genetically modifying mosquitoes to produce antibodies that neutralize the malaria parasite when it enters their bodies.

The other approach is to use "Gene Drive Technology," which involves modifying mosquitoes in a way that ensures the modified genes are passed on to a high proportion of their offspring. Already, many field trials of genetically engineered mosquitoes have been conducted or are underway in different parts of the world, most notably those conducted by the company Oxitec in Brazil and the Cayman Islands.

At the SBSTTA, scientific and technical advisors will look closely at the important environmental and ethical considerations related to GE mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization's 2023 World Malaria Report, there has been an increase in malaria infections all over the world as a result of climate change. However, several countries and organizations have serious reservations against the release of GM mosquitoes, which they believe may have an irreversible and devastating impact on local biodiversity. One of the most vocal organizations against GE/GM mosquitoes has been Friends of the Earth, a US-based environmental advocacy group. Dana Perls, senior program manager at Friends of the Earth, said, "Significant scientific research on genetically engineered mosquitoes is still needed to understand the potential public health and environmental threats associated with the release of this novel genetically engineered insect."

The SBSTTA is expected to witness passionate discussions, especially from environmental NGOs and faith-based organizations, including the need to ensure that communities are properly informed and engaged in decision-making processes, especially in the global south.

SBI: Most Crucial Agenda Items

The SBI was established under the CBD during the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD in 1996. The SBI's mandate includes providing guidance and recommendations to the COP on matters related to the implementation of the CBD as well as identifying obstacles and challenges that may hinder effective implementation.

Like SBSTTA, SBI also typically meets once or twice a year to conduct its work. Its discussions cover a wide range of topics related to the implementation of the CBD, including national biodiversity strategies and action plans, financial resources and mechanisms, capacity-building, and technology transfer.

Chaired by Chirra Achalender Reddy of India, the SBI in Nairobi has placed several items on its agenda. However, the most crucial ones among them are: 1) resource mobilization and financial mechanisms; 2) a review of the progress in national target setting; and 3) the updating of national biodiversity strategies and action plans.

As IPS recently reported, only a handful of countries have so far been able to submit their updated biodiversity action plans, while the rest are said to be facing multiple challenges in doing so, including a lack of capacity. In fact, Kenya, the host country of these meetings, has not been able to submit their updated action plan yet.

On Monday, in her inaugural address during the opening ceremony of SBSTTA, Ingrid Andersen, the Executive Director of UNEP, acknowledged that a lack of capacity to revise and update their action plans has been reported by several member states. "Capacity building is a serious issue and at the SBSTTA and SBI, this will be seriously discussed," Andersen said.

David Ainsworth, the Communications Director of UNCBD, said that the capacity is lacking in several areas, including communications (where countries do not know how to communicate to different ministries the need for working together to develop their biodiversity action plans), finance (lack of funding, budgetary constraints), and knowledge.

"Perhaps the most crucial of these is finance and this will be seriously discussed at the SBI," Ainsworth said.

HD 	Science Journalism in South Africa - Social Media Is Helping Connect With New Readers

Science journalism is about taking complex academic research and turning it into easy-to-read content that is still accurate. Aside from informing readers through evidence-based journalism, it aims to make the wider public curious about scientific research.

This article is an example of science journalism. As a media professor I conducted a study on how social media sites like X (formerly known as Twitter) can help science communication reach new audiences in South Africa. This article is a version of that study written in a way that people other than just academics can understand.

TD 
	

In my study I analysed the X feeds of three South African science journalism platforms: Bhekisisa, which focuses on health news; SciBraai, which specialises in local science news; and The Conversation Africa, which carries articles written by academics from a range of disciplines that are edited by journalists.

My study's analysis found that X offers unique advantages for communicating science. It allows interaction. It makes it possible to simplify complex information into easy-to-understand formats. And it supports multiple languages and media. This creates a more dynamic and inclusive way to share scientific knowledge.

I concluded from my findings that social media can significantly enhance the reach and understanding of African science journalism.

The challenges

Media scholars have highlighted a crucial problem in the global south. The dominance of English in science communication leads to a neglect of vital issues because it excludes the majority of the population. In South Africa, for example, only 9% of people speak English as a first language. Studies illustrate how this leaves audiences feeling there's a lack of relevant science content available.

Added to this is the enduring legacy of colonialism that reinforces the idea of science as an exclusive activity for a select few. These historical undercurrents shape science communicators' challenges.

Effective science journalism is made more complex by the need to frame scientific developments in ways that are culturally relevant to African readers. Added to this is a historical reliance on foreign sources in science news content that's published in the global south. This undermines the development of work tailored to African contexts.

There's no shortage of obstacles. Limited funding for science journalism and a lack of access to digital technologies in many parts of Africa pose the final hurdles to spreading reliable scientific information.

This is where social media comes in.

The study

My study shows that in South Africa X offers a glimmer of transformation for science communication.

I chose to investigate its advantages in a real-world setting by analysing three science journalism outlets. The three platforms I chose go beyond traditional science journalism by choosing to focus on research that is relevant to African audiences. This fills a critical gap, as science news most often has a western bias.

The Conversation Africa is part of a global network of not-for-profit outlets where academics collaborate with journalists and editors to make research accessible. Content is available for any other platform to freely republish, extending its reach, as is the case with SciBraai.

Bhekisisa is an award-winning health journalism centre focused on solutions-based reporting. It combines journalistic expertise with updates on medical research and it uses multimedia formats.

SciBraai specialises in local science news and scientists. It uses a multilingual approach (the English, isiZulu and Afrikaans languages) to enhance its reach

They also focus strongly on social media. And their orientation towards using clear language and visuals, as well as incorporating a multilingual approach, is an effective way of making knowledge accessible.

For example, Bhekisisa creates graphics and multimedia formats to explain complex medical developments. These visuals act as entry points into complex topics for a diverse audience.

For its part, SciBraai is challenging the dominance of English in science communication. It incorporates isiZulu, the most widely spoken language in South Africa, into its feed on X.

The outlets align with research that defines good science journalism. This is journalism that tries to keep the public informed about science, helps explain the implications of scientific research and supports related decision-making in a society.

Some argue that science journalism in the global south suffers from a lack of resources and a neglect of local scientific inquiry. But the practices I observed in these three outlets offer a more nuanced perspective.

It's important to note that I wasn't measuring how popular or successful the X accounts of these outlets are. I was interested in analysing how their use of social media aligns with the fundamental goals of science communication. To do this I downloaded all tweets from the three feeds and obtained all tweets that mention the accounts. The posts were analysed using content analysis, a research method that identifies trends and patterns in communications.

The pitfalls

My study highlights that X is not merely a broadcast tool for science journalism but can be a platform to cultivate dialogue. The ability of science communicators to respond to questions, address misconceptions and incorporate feedback from the public strengthens the trust between the scientific community and broader society. This empowers audiences to become active participants rather than passive recipients of information.

While these findings are encouraging, challenges remain in how the potential for direct audience engagement is only sometimes fully realised.

And social media comes with its own pitfalls. The spread of misinformation threatens the effectiveness of science communication efforts on X. Social media cannot replace robust investment in science journalism training, infrastructure, and widening access to technology throughout Africa.

X presents a tool for reaching audiences, not a solution. When wielded strategically, it can empower science communicators to diversify and deepen their impact.

HD 	African Development Bank President Calls for 'Bold and Innovative Approach' From Multilateral Development Banks to Tackle Global Challenges

Dr Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank Group, emphasised the urgent need for a "bold and innovative approach" from Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to effectively address the rapidly evolving challenges facing the world.

Adesina highlighted several transformative initiatives that align with both the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union's Agenda 2063.

TD 
	

The African Development Bank president was speaking on Tuesday 30 April at the Islamic Development Bank's 50th-anniversary symposium, titled Envisioning Future Value Propositions for MDBs: New Horizons for Cooperation. He was joined on the high-level panel by Dr Muhammad Al Jasser, Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) President, Cameroon's Minister of Economy, Planning and Regional Development, Mr. Alamine Ousmane Mey, and the World Bank's 'Vice President, Middle East and North Africa Dr Ousmane Dione.

Their discussions focused on the evolving roles of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in tackling the complex challenges confronting the Global South.

"We live in a world of massive challenges, a world which is fast-changing, and that will require a new approach," Adesina said, stressing, "No one can do it alone. We have to walk together, and we have to do it in a way that is innovative, impactful, and most importantly, in a way which is bold and faster."

Dr Adesina underscored the African Development Bank's commitment to its transformative High 5 priorities--Light Up and Power Africa, Feed Africa, Industrialize Africa, Integrate Africa, Improve the Quality of Life for the People of Africa--which are closely aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union's Agenda 2063. An independent review by the United Nations Development Program, he said, found that, "If Africa achieves these High 5s, it will have achieved 90% of all the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2063."

He revealed that during the finalisation of the Bank Group's recently approved Ten-Year Strategy, member countries resoundingly endorsed the continuation of the High 5s, adding that, "In the last eight years, our work has impacted on 400 million people."

He emphasised the critical importance of increasing concessional financing for low-income countries, particularly in Africa. Africa's share of commercial debt had risen from 17% to 44% between 2000 and 2024, he said. "We cannot be developing based on commercial debt," he said, calling for a significant increase in concessional financing across all multilateral development banks. He specifically advocated for tripling the resources of the Bank Group's concessional arm, the African Development Fund, to at least $25 billion for its next three-year replenishment cycle.

He also showcased some of the financial innovations the African Development Bank has introduced to mobilize more funding for Africa. "The other thing we are doing to increase the level of financial concessional financing for these low-income countries is that we got approval from our Board of Governors to take the equity we have accumulated inside the African Development Fund to go to the capital markets and leverage more money. That alone will allow us to actually leverage $27 billion additionally for moderately concessional financing for those countries."

The Islamic Development Bank's Al Jasser unveiled plans to double project approvals and disbursements to $364 billion over the next decade to accelerate sustainable development across its member countries. The initiative aims to leverage innovative financing strategies and partnerships to catalyse economic growth and development in the Global South.

Cameroon's Ousmane Mey outlined a comprehensive vision for MDBs centred around sustainable development financing at scale, support for macro stability and structural reform, and promoting a vibrant private sector.

He urged MDBs to prioritize scalability in their interventions and adapt their strategies to better align with the national agendas of member countries, thereby ensuring that development initiatives are both effective and sustainable.

In response, Al Jasser underscored IsDB's dedication to member-driven development. "Throughout the 50 years, the institution has financed more than 12,000 projects. It was really what the countries needed, and in their own thinking, in their own way, within their own plans."

He stressed that this initiative will not only enhance IsDB's capacity to effect change but also develop genuine partnerships with member countries.

The World Bank's Dione emphasized the importance of regional collaboration and integration as essential strategies for addressing the pressing challenges in the Global South.

Dione highlighted the need for MDBs to foster a deeper understanding of the complexities within different regions, advocating for tailored solutions that respect the unique socio-economic contexts of each area.

He underscored the importance of leveraging collective knowledge and resources to create impactful, sustainable outcomes that propel regional development forward.

The symposium reaffirmed the urgency to reshape the future of development finance, ensuring that MDBs remain indispensable catalysts of sustainable progress and prosperity in the Global South.

The African Development Bank's Adesina encapsulated the consensus from the discussions, stating, "It's not about your bank, it's not about your flag. It's about how our hands connect to allow us to scale and accelerate the development of people."

HD 	Three Decades of Freedom - Too Many Flaws in SA's Education System

In June 1976, thousands of black school children took to the streets in Soweto over the use of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction at majority black schools. More than 100 pupils died and approximately 700 were injured that day, and their bravery marked a turning point in South Africa's liberation struggle. Almost 50 years since that fateful day, and 30 years since the advent of democracy, and the struggle of the class of 1976 continues, as the medium of instruction remains a fundamental flaw in the current basic education system.

TD 
	

According to Dr Xolisa Guzula, an early literacy expert in the University of Cape Town's (UCT) School of Education, this is one of four reasons why South Africa finds itself in the grips of a literacy crisis and 80% of children in Grade 4 cannot read for meaning. The other three reasons include: a narrow conceptualisation of literacy as a skill while failing to understand it as a social practice; using English logic with teaching, reading and writing in African languages; and applying literacy pedagogies that emphasise rote learning (a memorisation technique based on repetition). For Dr Guzula and her peers, who are in the field working to evaluate and test innovative ways of getting children to read with understanding, this crucial sector of society has achieved "very little" in the past three decades.

"There are very few achievements. What we've managed to do is to ensure universal access to education and all children are expected to attend school. We've also managed to introduce a single curriculum for all children, unlike the differentiated curriculums for whites, blacks, coloureds and Indians under apartheid, and increased educational spending per child," Guzula said. "But there remains so much inequality materially. Things like science labs, school libraries, sports fields, school halls, as well as other enrichment activities such as the arts and sports between schools are nowhere near being equal."

UCT News spoke to Guzula to get some insight into the current state of the education system, 30 years into the democratic dispensation. She also provided tangible suggestions on how to turn the giant tanker around and improve education outcomes for millions of children.

Change the medium of instruction and improve pedagogy, content knowledge

To start, Guzula said the Department of Basic Education (DBE) must make a concerted effort with changing the medium of instruction in schools with majority of African language-speaking learners and improve pedagogic and content knowledge.

Currently, she said, African-language-speaking learners begin learning in their mother tongue from Grades 1 to 3. But once they reach Grade 4, they are forced to switch to English as the preferred medium of instruction. This, she explained, causes havoc and means that learners need to move from learning monolingually in their home languages to learning in English, even though they can't speak, read, or write in English at the required level expected of a child in Grade 4.

"English- and Afrikaans-speaking children are at an advantage when compared to their African-language-speaking peers."

"With the result, English- and Afrikaans-speaking children are at an advantage when compared to their African-language-speaking peers. They have the opportunity to learn in their mother tongues from Grade 1 to matric and beyond, but African-language-speaking children need to contend with an automatic language switch in Grade 4. This has countless ripple effects," she said.

"And what's worse is that the parents of African first-language speakers also find it difficult to help their children understand content at home because they don't understand it themselves."

Develop bilingual and multilingual education

During the early days of the democratic dispensation, Guzula said the department was committed to addressing this need and introduced the Bilingual/Multilingual Education Policy in 1997, which encourages the use of two or more languages for teaching, learning and assessment. The policy states that learning more than one language should be general practice and principle in South Africa and "being multilingual should be a defining characteristic of being South African". But there's been little movement with implementation.

Consequently, for African-speaking first-language learners, Guzula said, school textbooks are only published in English and are produced by English first-language speakers. School tasks and assessments are set in English as well. To support African first-language speakers and improve their learning outcomes, she said the DBE must focus on implementing the language policy, and train teachers on how best to develop bilingual textbooks and learning material to support their learners.

"Producing textbooks in English privileges the language, as well as the culture and identities associated with the language, which makes it challenging for learners to understand if they can't relate. And if assessments are set in English, learners struggle to express themselves both orally and in writing. This leads to them failing subjects, which ultimately leads to high grade repetition rates and dropout levels. We need to focus on developing multilingual education in order for our learners to flourish," she said.

Decolonise education

But that's not all. Guzula said the country has also made "very little progress" with decolonising education, which, she added, includes language, knowledge, pedagogies and being. She said the Rhodes Must Fall movement of 2015 called for decolonised education at universities. But this applies to schools as well.

At the time, she said, the students reminded everyone of the colonial matrix of power, which intersects to create hierarchies of privilege and inequality in society, as well as just how common it is for western knowledge and languages to dominate high status domains in the Global South.

"The result has been the expectation that indigenous people must be proficient in colonial languages and [absorb] colonial knowledge in Global South colonies [because] colonial languages dominate the curriculum and books."

"The result has been the expectation that indigenous people must be proficient in colonial languages and [absorb] colonial knowledge in Global South colonies [because] colonial languages dominate the curriculum and books. Kolonilingo-normativity needs to change in global south contexts," she said.

Train teachers adequately

And a large part of decolonising education starts with training African language-speaking teachers in their mother tongues and in English. This will help their learners to develop a proficiency in English, while preserving the cultures, traditions and stories that have been a part of the fabric of teachers' lives and imparting it onto their learners.

"Because language carries knowledge, training teachers exclusively in a language that is different to their mother tongue erases African languages in the education system, as well as from teachers' knowledge, and means they start learning mechanically when learning in a new language," Guzula said. "Recently, there have been comments about teachers' lack of content knowledge. Yes, teachers also struggle if they are required to learn in English only and flourish when they are taught bi/multilingually. It applies to their learners too."

"What we need to do is embrace both technical skills and literacy practices and make reading and writing a daily social practice."

With this, she said, teachers also need to improve the way in which they teach literacy, which is expected to come naturally as they are given an opportunity to learn and teach in their mother tongue.

"We also need to move away from thinking of literacy as teaching and learning technical skills. Instead, what we need to do is embrace both technical skills and literacy practices and make reading and writing a daily social practice. To become better at reading and writing, you need to make it part of your daily activities," she said. "And in teaching literacy skills, educators need to work with phonological and morphological approaches to ensure learners grasp reading with meaning."

Moving forward

Despite the many flaws in the system, Guzula said the sector has made progress with moving the Grade R aspect of early childhood development (ECD) learning from the Department of Social Development to the DBE. And ECD practitioners, specialists and academics have long advocated for this move. This approach, she said, places a standardised training programme in place to ensure ECD specialists offer children early learning opportunities besides just care and protection.

Reassuringly, the department has also made some progress on the language of teaching, learning and assessment issue - a fundamental step towards developing multilingual learning spaces. On 21 February, the minister of DBE, Angie Motshekga launched the Mother-Tongue-based Bilingual Education programme, which stipulates that Grade 4 learners will be allowed to continue learning in an African language, while adding English as the second medium of instruction.

"This programme is a positive step forward and will be a game-changer in learners' learning journeys."

"Research shows us that children learn best in the languages they know best, and our systems should allow for this. By adopting multilingual education, our children will feel like they are important and that their languages are valued and appreciated. This programme is a positive step forward and will be a game-changer in learners' learning journeys," Guzula said.

HD 	Climate Finance - Did the IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings Move the Dial?

An expert panel give their verdict on whether the Spring Meetings offered Africa hope that climate finance will be expanded and reformed.

In a year in which climate finance will take centre stage in climate negotiations, all eyes were on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Spring Meetings last week to see what kind of tone they would set. Both institutions are under growing pressure to reform, including to massively expand funding available to tackle the climate crisis, but have been accused of moving far too slowly.

TD 
	

We asked a range of experts, academics, and activists what they learnt from Spring Meetings, whether the talks moved the needle on climate finance, and what the outcomes mean for Africa.

Grace Ronoh: There were two illusions of progress

At this year's Spring Meetings, there were two hot topics of conversation in relation to climate finance and Africa.

The first was the announcement by World Bank President Ajay Banga of a new plan to provide 250 million people across Africa with affordable electricity by 2030, with an additional 50 million people being reached by the African Development Bank. All the new power generation will apparently come from renewable sources and the Bank intends to support countries to "green" their electricity production.

This is a welcome move, but it will be important to make sure that the Bank puts its money where its mouth is, and carries out this new commitment with accountability and transparency to the African people who are most affected by the energy and climate crises.

The second was replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA21), the Bank's lending arm for low-income countries. At the meetings, African civil society representatives called on IDA21 to provide grants and highly concessional finance to support African countries on the frontline of climate impacts, particularly given crippling debt burdens.

Despite these illusions of progress, the IMF and World Bank's engagement in climate finance for Africa still fails to address the root causes of climate injustice and poverty. To truly support sustainable development and climate resilience in Africa, there is an urgent need for a paradigm shift towards community-led initiatives, debt relief, and genuine partnerships that prioritise social and environmental justice over profit and power.

*liiitag Grace Ronoh is the Africa Climate Finance Manager at Recourse.

Saliem Fakir: Africa remains $2.5 trillion short

2024 is a critical year for making significant headway on international development and climate finance. This year, a new collective quantified goal (NCQG) for climate finance flows will need to be negotiated and agreed. In Washington DC, discussions on climate finance took centre stage, as global efforts increasingly steer towards climate action. This is happening as the agenda on reforming global economic governance unfolds to enhance the legitimacy and efficacy of International Financial Institutions (IFIs).

Despite pledges made to boost lending for climate, the ability for donor contributions and IFIs, alike, to allocate sufficient resources towards climate finance remains in question. Africa is said to be $2.5 trillion short of climate finance by 2030.

For Africa, adaptation finance and debt burdens were strong points of discussion. Adaptation is grossly underfunded, and many African countries are in debt distress or at high risk of distress. The cost of servicing these debts have exceeded the $400 billion due to the lopsided global financial and debt architecture that perpetuates unsustainable debt cycles in low-and-middle countries. In addition, official development assistance (ODA), which remains an important source of external financing, is inadequate and trending downwards. The result is growing financing demands in the most vulnerable countries.

The call for an ambitious replenishment of IDA21 is an important step to availing more concessional resources, and potentially additional climate finance, for impoverished countries. The unveiling of new financial instruments, that could potentially generate $70 billion over years is welcome. But real impact will be felt when needs of people are met.

*liiitag Saliem Fakir is Executive Director of the African Climate Foundation.

Joab Okanda: Profit-based approaches are doomed from the start

The Spring Meetings were clear demonstration of how the WB and IMF and their architects are stubbornly not learning the lessons of the past while the climate crisis clock is ticking. They acknowledge the brutal cocktail of shocks that the Global South faces but are not keen to move away from their failed development models that built the brutal world we live in today.

At the end of the week, the V20, the group of 55 countries most threatened by climate change who represent 1.4 billion people, stressed that continued high levels of debt are "crowding out the ability of governments to achieve their climate change and development goals", for which the meetings proposed no solutions whatsoever. Instead, we witnessed an attempt to worsen the debt crisis by the desire to provide climate finance largely in the form of loans, not grants.

During the meetings, new pledges of $11 billion were made to make the World Bank bigger and boost three of its initiatives (the eight Global Challenges Programmes, hybrid capital, and the Liveable Planet Fund). Not only is this amount peanuts compared to the needs of what is required under reparative and climate justice; as long as those are debt creating instruments, where the driving question is whether private financiers can profit rather than whether it will actually help people and planet, these initiatives will remain doomed from the start.

The World Bank cannot become bigger before better. A true reform would mean stopping seeking profit-based approaches to attract private sector to the climate space, when we know that private finance is limited for mitigation, neglects adaptation, and is completely inadequate to address loss and damage. A true global reform of IFIs should prioritise grant-based finance, provide measures to increase the fiscal space in the Global South, end their large financing for fossil fuels, and change their governance structures to enable more voice and participation from the Global South.

*liiitag Joab Okanda is the Pan-Africa senior advocacy advisor at Christian Aid.

Danny Bradlow: How to balance climate with health, education, poverty and more?

The Spring meetings highlighted the complexity of the climate finance issue for the IFIs. On the one hand, they are trying to meet the demand for more climate financing. In the fiscal year ending in 2023, the World Bank Group increased the funds loaned for climate-related purposes by more than 20%, allocating 41% of all its lending to climate. The IMF's new Resilience and Sustainability Trust is operational and has provided financing to 18 countries, primarily for adaptation. It is reviewing its Debt-Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries so that it incorporates climate considerations.

On the other hand, these developments have raised concerns in their consumer member states. The World Bank's survey of its borrower countries shows that climate ranks number 11 on the list of priorities of its borrower states. Health, education, agriculture and food security, and water and sanitation rank much higher. In the case of the IMF, there is concern that while it is expanding its role in regard to the macro-critical aspects of climate - i.e. those crucial to achieving macroeconomic and financial stability - it is doing so in an opaque and unpredictable way because it has not made publicly available the principles and procedures it uses when deciding that a climate issue is macro-critical.

The challenge for the IFIs, therefore, is how to balance the demands to deal with climate, to end extreme poverty, and to operate in way that is environmentally and socially responsible. It is noteworthy in this regard that the Development Committee "reiterated the importance of accountability mechanisms in enhancing development outcomes and stimulating internal learning and feedback".

*liiitag Danny Bradlow is a Professor/Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Advancement of Scholarship at the University of Pretoria.

Susan Otieno: The WB must get better before it can get bigger

African countries are not only dealing with the unfair impacts of the climate crisis but many are also crumbling under the weight of debt accumulated through climate disasters, and through loans branded as "climate finance". These huge loans owed to the World Bank, IMF, and wealthy countries' banks have made it harder to free up the funds needed for climate action. Perversely, countries are often forced to expand fossil fuel and industrial agriculture production in order to repay those debts, worsening the climate crisis and their own suffering.

Civil society's #FixTheFinance mobilisations across twenty countries including Kenya, Liberia and Washington DC in the US during last week's Spring Meetings called on wealthy countries to provide REAL finance (grants) and to cancel the loans that have been pushing countries deeper into debt.

But we are yet to see grant-based finance on the scale needed. The World Bank is letting rich countries off the hook by counting dodgy finance channels as "climate finance" even though this does not help the most affected communities. The richest polluters are insufficiently taxed for the funds needed to finance climate action. Meanwhile, the World Bank is still financing fossil fuels and destructive industrial agriculture.

It's time to limit the harm caused by colonial institutions like the World Bank and IMF. Until the World Bank gets its house in order, it is not the right channel for climate finance. The World Bank needs to get far "Better" before it can get "Bigger". While it tries to ignore criticism, it is getting harder for it to hide its problematic approach.

On the plus side, last week's civil society mobilisations mean that we're in better shape to keep up the momentum and pressure for COP29 climate talks to agree to an ambitious, fair and grant-based new climate finance goal.

*liiitag Susan Otieno is the Executive Director of ActionAid International, Kenya.

Fadhel Kaboub: The WB and IMF have climate finance completely backwards

My main message to the World Bank and the IMF is that they are getting climate finance completely backwards. They are lending money to the wrong countries and imposing austerity on the wrong countries.

They should be lending money to the historic polluters to help them pay for their climate debt in the form of debt cancellation. And they should be providing grants rather than loans to Global South countries to invest in food sovereignty and agroecology, renewable energy sovereignty and high value-added manufacturing, along with transfer of lifesaving technologies to manufacture and deploy clean energy, clean cooking, and clean transportation infrastructure.

Instead of imposing austerity on the Global South, the World Bank and IMF should be asking the historic polluters to tighten their belts, reduce their energy use, reduce waste, eliminate planned obsolescence, and fight consumerism under a coherent and comprehensive degrowth framework.

In other words, we should be thinking of the Global North as the countries that need climate finance, and the Global South as the countries that are owed a climate debt.

With their leading roles regionally and in the G20 and COP30, a Brazil-South Africa partnership could prompt useful south-south ties.

Africa's climate dialogue has shifted. While initially dominated by extreme weather events, there is now a growing conversation on the transition to a low-carbon economy and its implications.

TD 
	

The case made at the 2023 United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference (COP28) and several other forums is that Africa's global emission status is negligible - less than 4% of emissions. The continent also has high energy needs to provide affordable and accessible energy as per UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 and Africa's Agenda 2063 development aspirations.

To date, international climate partnerships have been between African and developed countries. They have been dominated by energy transitions away from fossil fuels, particularly the Just Energy Transition Partnerships, such as those of South Africa and Senegal. This has been replicated in Asian countries. Key features of these agreements are loan packages at lower-than-market interest rates to fund renewable energy infrastructure development.

While Just Energy Transition Partnerships are catalytic, it's time to give meaning to south-south climate partnerships. Several developing countries are making rapid progress with their climate-resilient development initiatives. China already has over 80% of the manufacturing capacity for the solar panel value chain globally, and could become the leading producer of electric vehicles.

India is putting up a strong challenge in both domains. Brazil is a leading renewable energy country, with 40% of its power already coming from renewables. It is a global leader in biofuels, with ethanol available at most garages in its major urban centres. The Gulf states are also making major investments in renewable energy-driven development.

The idea of a BRICS Climate Club is becoming more attractive, with many members making substantive investments in a just transition. More importantly, this demonstrates the capacity of the global south.

The south-south climate partnership idea enjoyed favour at April's climate change and G20 workshops co-convened by the South African Institute of International Affairs and Brazil's Institute for Applied Economic Research. This was part of the Think20 series in support of Brazil's G20 presidency this year.

The time is right for the global south to unite around climate issues. In 2022, the G20 agreed on global south leadership for four successive years. Indonesia in 2022 was followed by India in 2023, with Brazil at the helm in 2024 and South Africa scheduled for next year.

Brazil's presidency has made climate change a focus of the G20 this year. The plan is for South Africa to continue this emphasis in 2025. Climate finance and resourcing a just energy transition are priorities for the G20 Summit and its finance ministerial meeting. This year's summit will be held just before Brazil hosts COP30 in 2025.

In a divided world on a rocky road to multipolarity, the traditional institutions of multilateralism have not enjoyed global support. Israel's war in Gaza and the war in Ukraine have been divisive. In the 2024 Körber Stiftung Emerging Middle Powers Report, 38% of respondents from India, Brazil and South Africa saw the G20 as being equipped to solve global challenges, while 18% said the same of the UN.

For these significant emerging economies, the G20 matters. The African Union will participate as a full G20 member for the first time this year. Africa already expressed its climate ambition at the inaugural African Climate Summit 2023 and is the first region to complete a continental climate security risk assessment report.

South Africa and Brazil are ideal partners in climate and sustainable development. They are the only two countries that have convened summits of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development - in 1992 and 2012 in Rio and 2002 in Johannesburg. They're two of only 17 mega-diverse countries with biodiversity, conservation and sustainable development as priorities. Both are climate change leaders in their regions and are deeply invested in a just energy transition to underpin their development pathways.

Closer relations will also be mutually beneficial. President Lula da Silva has expressed a desire to build a stronger Brazil-Africa partnership. This is based on Brazil's historical connection to Africa, its willingness to be an active player in the continent's growth and development, and a beneficiary of Africa's projected increase in production and consumption.

In addition to a valuable country-to-country partnership, Brazil and South Africa could be an important bridge between Africa and Latin America for mutual growth and low-carbon development.

The novelty of Just Energy Transition Partnerships is being overshadowed by developing world realities - transition speed issues, the possibility of stranding fossil fuel assets and the need for simultaneous high investment in climate adaptation. Developing countries also have to deal with climate-related disasters, both acute (like extreme weather) and longer-term (increasing temperatures and sea level rise).

In current energy partnerships, developing countries have limited ability to set a reasonable pace of transition as they grapple with the pressure of new carbon-based barriers to trade and global markets. A need to decolonise the transition is gaining momentum.

Developing countries should invest in deeper south-south alliances beyond sharing their Just Energy Transition Partnerships experiences. New agreements must extend across the climate change response value chain, with the joint objectives of reducing climate damage and accelerated development of global south countries.

A Brazil-South Africa climate partnership - powered partly by their successive G20 presidencies - would be a good point of inflection.

The questions of fairness and inclusiveness are among the priorities that Africans and the Global South have continuously been asking major organizations of the world.

Sections of the globe that have never been treated equally like their sister sects have cried for their ultimate right to be included and able to reflect their own views without depending on other powers. Africa, in this case, has suffered a lot. And, the continent has been asking for an absolute reform in major financial institutions and powerful blocs to consider the ones who have been bystanders for their own issues.

TD 
	

Many countries around the world and the continent Africa have been neglected in the major global issues and received whatever decision that a handful of nations pass. Due to the long era of colonialism and its consequences, Africa could not find any way to make itself seen and have its own decision. The continent and its people have been victims of the system and it still suffers major blows in political, economic, and social issues.

Through its continental bloc and some major African actors like Ethiopia, Africa has called upon the world to consider reform in major global organizations, and Ethiopia has been the voice of Africa like before. The country has proven itself as a true pro- Pan African nation that defends continental interest. Ethiopia has been a pioneer country to raise the question of fairness and inclusiveness and leave no one behind.

History teaches that Ethiopia is still considered as the beacon of hope and freedom for the black people and the whole Africa. Its victory over colonialism and its perception, Ethiopia shows the world what freedom and equality is. The country is still striving to meet its stand towards independence and impartiality and to be treated fairly like any other.

To this part, Ethiopia, as a voice of Africa, has been calling on responsible stakeholders to realize proper reforms in major global blocs and financial organizations to incorporate Africa and the continent to be represented by Africans. Ethiopia has been advocating on reforming the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) so that Africa, with 1.4 billion populations, deserves a permanent seat at the high table.

For Instance, during the 35th Ordinary Session of the African Union (AU), Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (PhD) underscored that Africans deserve permanent seats at the UNSC. The premier noted, "This is particularly through of the United Nations. We as Africans lack representation in the Security Council and are underrepresented in a variety of ways. It is the right time to reform and revitalize the United Nations system to reflect current global realities and ensure that a more representative body with only fair representation and transparency in those institutions can usher in a just era in multilateralism.

Similarly, during his biweekly press briefing recently, Nebiyu Tedla, Foreign Affairs Spokesperson stated that Ethiopia is one of the leading countries that are raising voices for Africa to have a permanent seat at the UN Security Council by strengthening its participation in the multilateral institutions of which it is a founder. Adding, the current UNSC does not reflect the Global South and Africa, which constitutes over 20 percent of the UN member states.

Besides, like Ethiopia, most African nations including the Continental bloc, the African Union (AU), are expressing their strong desire and pushing so hard to add Africa in the world's high table and get a permanent seat. On top of that, actions have been taken to realize the long waited call for permanent representation.

Lately, according to a report from local media, a roundtable discussion was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia with the aim to discuss on how to achieve a reform at the UNSC where diplomatic corps based in the capital city participated.

During the discussion, AU Political Affairs, Peace & Security Commissioner Bankole Adeoye said that the world remembers Africa when they need its solidarity in the UN General Assembly, and it is battling with its own challenges. The current UN Security Council (UNSC) does not in any way reflect the Global South and Africa, which constitutes over 20 percent of the UN member states.

However, Africa is a formidable force that could potentially be strongly united, resilient and influential, he stated, and stressed that "54 member states in the UN system that is already over 20 percent that can be a force to reckon with, but we are not at the table." adding Africa is not at the most important round-table that speaks about peace and security in the world.

"Multilateralism cannot be what we see in the current composition of the UNSC. It is not inclusive, equitable, representative, and democratic; and it is not in any way reflecting the Global South. It does not reflect Africa as we want. So, we want a united, resilient Africa that would promote the sustainable development goals but also lead to the next level," the Commissioner stressed.

The negotiations and process and reform package of the UNSC reform has been going on for decades, Ambassador Bakole stated.

According to him, promoting global identity and shared values are crucial to achieve the reform which currently is missing in the UNSC. Adeoye underscored that "there is no way we are going to have a council that is reformed and does not speak to the shared values of all UN member states as humanity."

Also, the veto is not democratic, he pointed out, and noted "I can imagine in our national systems, intergovernmental institutions there is nowhere that veto is exercised recklessly, consistently, and without restrain." But in this case, autocracy at national level is condemned while veto system is put in place at international level that blocks reasonable and most efficient use for international diplomacy.

"What the AU is saying is that we want to be a strong united influential player in the international system; and that means that we must use all the arrows we have to make sure we bring peace and stability to our continent and to the world and effectively."

Finally, Adeoye underlined that Africa wants the UN to reform its council "because our issues will be reflected based on what we believe are globally shared values, shared experiences and lessons, and the action that comes with whichever process."

All in all, Africa will not stop until it reaches its goal to witness real reforms in major blocs and organizations and get a permanent representation. It is absurd to leave 1.4 billion people behind and cry for democracy and a peaceful world. Ethiopia, as always, voices the interest of the continent showing its unwavering stand regarding equality and inclusiveness. Africa has to have a permanent sent in the UN Security Council and other financial organizations, and it remains committed to be a catalyst in the process.

Since its inception, the project of international criminal justice has been marked by a striking indifference to the long historical record of atrocities perpetrated by the Western world against people of the Global South, and Africa in particular. More recent attempts to construct an ostensibly universal system of criminal justice through the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) have also been marred by the persistence of Western impunity.

A draft treaty on crimes against humanity under discussion within the halls of the United Nations at present could offer an opportunity to address some of the prevailing critiques of the ICC frequently charged by Global South states. However, the voices of the Global South -- and particularly African states -- have been largely ambivalent or absent in the treaty discussions so far.

Brief history of crimes against humanity

Crimes against humanity form one of the so-called core crimes, along with genocide, war crimes and aggression, that today define international criminal law. They comprise criminal acts -- such as murder, torture, enslavement, persecution, rape and other forms of sexual violence -- when such acts are knowingly committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population.

Crimes against humanity emerged in the wake of World War II as a response to the horrors of the Holocaust.

The voices of the Global South and particularly African states have been largely ambivalent or absent in the treaty discussions so far. Melissa Hendrickse

Although Western states presided over nearly four prior centuries of atrocities committed against people of the Global South in the name of conquest, empire and colonisation, it was only when comparable violence was unleashed within the borders of Europe itself that these states would come to concern themselves with codifying and universalising the criminalisation of such acts.

To recall the words of Aime Césaire, Europeans "tolerated [...] Nazism before it was inflicted on them, [...] they absolved it, shut their eyes to it, legitimised it, because, until then, it had been applied only to non-European peoples." Neither the colonial conquest of Latin America and genocide of indigenous peoples, nor the enslavement, chattelisation and colonisation of Africans by Europeans in the centuries preceding World War II were sufficient to generate the Western moral outrage that would give rise to the official recognition of crimes against humanity -- crimes that "deeply shock the conscience of humanity" -- in the mid-20th century.

International criminal law and the Global South

Three quarters of a century after the end of World War II, international criminal law and the prohibition of crimes against humanity have acquired widespread acceptance and application. For example, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the world's "court of last resort" established in 1998, has received broad ratification by states on all continents.

Even if they are not member states to the ICC, most have accepted the general notions of international criminal law, including the principal rules on crimes against humanity. States of the Global South are now, for the most part, willing participants in the project of international criminal justice. In fact, rather than being passive recipients of the legal edifices of international criminal justice, these states have played an active role in contesting and shaping this very architecture.

It was the galvanisation of the Third World bloc, including many newly independent African states, in the UN General Assembly during the 1950s and 1960s that led to the designation of apartheid as a crime against humanity in the 1973 Apartheid Convention, introducing universal jurisdiction over the crime of apartheid and individual criminal responsibility for those who commit the crime of apartheid as well as those who directly abet, encourage or cooperate in its commission.

This was in spite of some Western states' opposition in the General Assembly and their unwavering support and supply of diplomatic cover and arms to Pretoria, the seat of South Africa's apartheid regime, well into the 1980s.

African states were also among the most fervent supporters of the establishment of an international criminal court and some of the earliest signatories to the Rome Statute.

As a representative of the Organisation of African Unity expressed during the 1998 diplomatic conference in Rome, "Africa had a particular interest in the establishment of the court, since its peoples had been the victims of large-scale violations of human rights over the centuries: slavery, wars of colonial conquest and continued acts of war and violence, even in the post-colonial era".

More recently, in the wake of Israel's unrelenting military onslaught on Gaza (endorsed and financed by its Western allies) and its prolonged system of apartheid against Palestinians, the Global South has sought to assume the mantle of ostensibly defending a truly universal application of international law and justice.

No strangers to colonial violence, occupation and racial subordination, states of the Global South have sought to operationalise the blunt instruments of international criminal law against its original authors, who more often than not enjoy impunity for the crimes they have visited upon the rest of the world.

In December last year, South Africa instituted a case against Israel before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that the Israeli state is violating its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention as a result of its ongoing military onslaught and siege on Palestinians in Gaza.

This was followed by Nicaragua's initiation of proceedings against Germany, asserting that the German state had not only failed to comply with its legal duty to prevent genocide in Gaza but had contributed to its commission through the provision of arms and assistance to Israel -- violating both the Genocide Convention and international humanitarian law.

In February this year, during hearings before the ICJ concerning the legality of Israel's prolonged occupation of Palestinian land since at least 1967, many states of the Global South took the floor to argue that Israel's occupation and the system of apartheid it imposes on Palestinians constitute grave violations of international law.

Among those states was Namibia, which had itself been the subject of a series of ICJ cases some 60 years earlier. One of these cases had also been initiated by African states -- Liberia and Ethiopia -- to contest the continued application of the League of Nations' colonial mandate system over Namibia (then South West Africa) and the system of apartheid that the mandatory power, then Union of South Africa, was imposing in Namibia.

During Namibia's oral intervention in the February hearings on the legality of Israel's occupation, Minister of Justice Yvonne Dausab recalled that Namibia "has known only too well the pain and suffering of occupation, colonialism, systematic discrimination, apartheid, and their entrenched consequences".

"It is because of this history that Namibia considers it a moral duty and sacred responsibility to appear before this court on the question of the indefensible occupation of Palestine by Israel."

Ubiquity of Western double standards

Notwithstanding these interventions by states of the Global South, international criminal law has not entirely transcended its uneven origins and continues to be haunted by the spectre of what some call selectivity or double standards and others, blatant Western exceptionalism. As legal scholar Asad Kiyani observes, "ICL [international criminal law] promises an idealisation of Western liberal criminal law fused with a utopian ethos but is often bogged down in the politics of unequal enforcement that seem to characterise international law."

Much of the blame for this is laid at the feet of the ICC, which has "focused its prosecutorial lens" almost exclusively on Africa since it began operating in 2002. Out of the 54 individuals indicted by the ICC to date, 47 are African -- giving rise to the charge by the continent's leaders that the ICC is a colonial white person's court preoccupied with "hunting Africans".

Although many of these claims have been rebutted as self-serving machinations by African elites seeking to evade accountability, the fact remains that no Western leader or military personnel has been investigated or charged by the ICC since it opened its doors 22 years ago.

This is certainly not for a lack of international crimes committed by Western leaders and military personnel but rather purportedly due to what the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC has termed "viability and budgetary constraints" affecting the court.

In 2020, these constraints led the Office of the Prosecutor to decide not to investigate war crimes by the United Kingdom's forces in Iraq (despite the prosecutor's own finding that such crimes had in fact been committed), and in 2021 to "deprioritise" an investigation into war crimes committed by US forces in Afghanistan.

But, as Amnesty International has noted, "just six months later, the prosecutor launched his officer's largest ever investigation in Ukraine", which has since produced a total of four arrest warrants in a record time of two years.

While these arrest warrants are welcome, it is notable that the prosecutor's ongoing investigation into international crimes committed in Palestine, initiated in 2021, continues to lag without any tangible progress and certainly no arrest warrants to date -- even as Israel's onslaught on Gaza continues unabated.

A new draft convention on crimes against humanity

The draft articles on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity were drafted by the International Law Commission (ILC) between 2013 and 2019 and then transmitted to the UN General Assembly's Sixth Committee, the UN's principal forum for the consideration of legal questions.

After a period of political stalemate in the Sixth Committee, discussions on the draft articles were revived in late 2022 and state delegates met in New York in April last year to "exchange substantive views" on all aspects of the draft articles. The Sixth Committee gathered in New York once more this April to continue discussing the draft articles before proceeding to decide in October on whether to move discussions into formal treaty negotiations.

The draft articles are significant in that they propose to close a gap in the architecture of international criminal law.

Unlike other crimes under international law such as genocide, apartheid, torture and enforced disappearance, there is no specialised international treaty on crimes against humanity.

Another significant feature of the draft articles is the inclusion of the obligation not only to punish, but also to prevent, crimes against humanity (akin to the duty to prevent under the Genocide Convention which has been a key component of South Africa's application to the ICJ).

Moreover, unlike the Rome Statute of the ICC, which contemplates the cooperation of states with the court for purposes of investigating and prosecuting international crimes, the draft articles concern horizontal cooperation between states for purposes of prosecutions at the national level.

This is significant because it allows states to "do it themselves", rather than rely on investigations and prosecutions by an international tribunal like the ICC, which has shown itself reluctant to turn its prosecutorial eye to crimes committed by Western powers.

The draft articles present an opportunity for states of the Global South, and Africa in particular, to continue their historical legacy of helping to shape the architecture of international criminal law and to challenge the persistence of Western impunity.

While some African states such as The Gambia, South Africa and Sierra Leone have expressed their support for the future adoption of a treaty on crimes against humanity, the majority of states on the continent have yet to adopt or articulate a clear public stance on the treaty and its draft provisions or where they have, it has been largely ambivalent.

Morocco was the only African state to have submitted formal written comments and observations on the draft articles by the December 2023 deadline set by the UN General Assembly.

While African states continue to seek justice in forums such as the ICJ and to highlight Western double standards on the world stage, they must not neglect the ongoing discussions on the draft articles on crimes against humanity. As the current moment has reminded us, it cannot be left only to the West to act on, much less prevent, crimes against humanity.

Integrity is key as world's largest carbon market auction is held in Nairobi

Carbon markets are increasingly dominating conversations about climate change interventions, especially in Africa. The world's largest carbon market auction was held last June in Nairobi, where more than 2.2 million tonnes of carbon credits sold. Raphael Obonyo spoke to Riham ElGizy, CEO of Regional Voluntary Carbon Market Company (RVCMC) who hosted the event on what it means for Africa.

TD 
	

Here are the excerpts:

Riham ElGizy What is the current situation with carbon credits and market?

The voluntary carbon trading sector has been growing exponentially, hitting $2 billion in 2022. In recent months, we have seen carbon markets mature rapidly.

Policy frameworks are being drawn up and trading infrastructure is becoming more sophisticated. These developments create a real opportunity for us, particularly in the lead up to the launch of our exchange. We recognise that for the market to reach its potential and play a meaningful role in decarbonization, we must be strict on issues of integrity.

That is why we only trade in high quality carbon credits that have undergone significant due diligence and meet the highest international standards. But to mature further, the market also needs innovation in the form of new ways of channeling climate finance to projects and regions that need it most, such as those in the Global South.

Having held two of our largest carbon credit auctions, we are committed to creating a thriving market for carbon offsets that play a role in tackling climate change while improving livelihoods across the Global South.

Can you tell us in a nutshell about the work of Regional Voluntary Carbon Market?

We are creating a credible voluntary carbon market at speed and at scale - one that has integrity at its core, channels finance towards climate action, and seeks to improve livelihoods across the Global South.

Our aim is to create a robust and successful market for both the generation and use of voluntary carbon credits in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and play a meaningful role in assisting the transition to a low carbon global economy.

All about carbon markets

*liiitag What are carbon markets?

Carbon markets are trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought. Companies or individuals can use carbon markets to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

One tradable carbon credit equals one tonne of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas reduced, sequestered or avoided.

When a credit is used to reduce, sequester, or avoid emissions, it becomes an offset and is no longer tradable.

*liiitag Why are carbon markets important?

The bad news: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are still rising across all major sectors globally, albeit at a slower pace. The good news: renewables are now cheaper often than coal, oil, and gas.

Despite some progress, the world faces a formidable challenge. Scientists warn 2°C of warming will be exceeded during the 21st century unless we achieve deep reductions in GHG emissions now.

Effective action will require concerted and sufficient investment, knowing also that the costs of inaction will be far higher.

*liiitag So how do we drive - and finance - the transformation needed to address the climate crisis?

Many countries are looking to carbon markets as part of the answer.

*liiitag How many types of carbon markets are there?

There are broadly two types of carbon markets: compliance and voluntary.

Compliance markets are created as a result of any national, regional and/or international policy or regulatory requirement.

Voluntary carbon markets - national and international - refer to the issuance, buying and selling of carbon credits, on a voluntary basis.

Why are we hearing more about carbon markets?

Carbon finance will be key for the implementation of the NDCs, and the Paris Agreement enables the use of such market mechanisms through Article 6.

*liiitag What are the challenges?

Progress has been made towards agreeing on the processes and methodologies that countries need to follow to access the carbon markets.

However, there are also serious concerns including issues related to double-counting of GHG emission reductions, human rights abuses, and greenwashing (in which companies falsely market their green credentials, for example, misrepresentations of climate-neutral products or services).

UNDP

What was the voluntary carbon credit auction in Nairobi all about and could you share some of the highlights and outcomes?

In June 2023, we hosted a carbon market auction in Nairobi, Kenya, selling over 2.2 million tonnes of carbon credits, and becoming the world's largest auction. The auction basket contained high quality CORSIA-eligible and Verra-registered carbon credits, with three quarters of the credits originating from countries across MENA, which is the region we have been targeting for growth.

The projects related to the Nairobi auction were a mix of CO2 avoidance and removal, the majority of which are originated in Africa. This includes the supply of improved clean cookstoves to communities in Kenya and Rwanda, and renewable energy projects in Egypt and South Africa.

Sixteen Saudi regional and international companies took part in the auction, with Aramco, Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) and ENOWA, purchasing the largest number of carbon credits.

The auction was a demonstration of Saudi Arabia's commitment to tackling climate change in line with the Saudi Green Initiative and Vision 2030.

What efforts are you engaged in to drive funds needed to deliver climate action and improve livelihoods across the Global South?

At RVCMC we believe that voluntary carbon markets will be key to driving both livelihoods and climate action. And these go hand in hand.

Today MENA accounts for only 2% of demand for carbon credits, mostly delivered by the RVCMC. From our base in Saudi Arabia, RVCMC is well-positioned to shape this market going forward and is committed to investing in carbon mitigation projects across the Global South including Africa.

The world's 50 poorest nations contributed only 1% of emissions but suffer 99% of climate related deaths. We want to make a difference.

There are concerns that the carbon markets risks becoming a failing model especially if there is lack of environmental transparency. What is your view?

We need to tackle climate change using every tool at our disposal. We know that carbon offsets are an important instrument to help accelerate companies' net-zero strategies. This is a new and fast-growing space, and as with any developing industry, there will be issues and challenges, in this case, questions around varying standards and protocol.

Going forward, developing robust verification methods will be crucial to supporting the efficiency of carbon trading as the industry evolves.

RVCMC is already committed to exclusively facilitating the trading of high-quality carbon credits. Our recent auction only offered CORSI-eligible and Verra-registered credits. The company also works with two separate, independent expert teams to vet projects that contribute credits for sale.

We support efforts to increase transparency and are confident that our track record shows we can continue to build a credible voluntary carbon market at speed and at scale, with integrity at its core.

How can Africa benefit from partnerships in terms of carbon credits economy?

RVCMC is committed to improving livelihoods in the Global South, and Africa is an important market for us, being the source of significant nature and technology-based carbon project opportunities.

We recently committed to developing a relationship with stakeholders in Africa by signing two MoUs: one with Eveready East Africa Plc and another with Carbon Vista Nigeria LP.

We will keep building on these relationships, focusing on securing buyer and seller relationships that will ultimately drive growth across the continent.

Projections that assume the Global North will continue to over-emit help perpetuate inequalities and violate principles of equity, warn scientists.

A growing body of scientists and other experts in the Global South are calling for what they see as "blinkered" and "neo-colonialist" assumptions in climate models to be addressed. They argue that scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which inform policy at the national and global level, project unequal futures where developing countries remain poor for decades.

TD 
	

Participants at a meeting of the African Group of Negotiators Experts Support (AGNES) held between 20-22 March raised concerns that the IPCC's latest report, i.e. the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), falls short on equity and climate justice in its pathways for mitigating climate change. AGNES is a non-profit think tank that provides scientific expertise to inform a common African position in climate change negotiations.

Last month, a paper published in the journal Climate Policy assessed 556 scenarios in AR6 that relate to mitigation action such as reducing CO2 emissions and increasing carbon sequestration. The authors found that the scenarios project current disparities between the Global North and South to continue up to 2050. The models suggest that income, emissions, and consumption of goods, services and energy will remain low for decades in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the former faring the worst.

The IPCC report notes in multiple chapters that climate action requires transformational changes in economic and technological systems. But modelling approaches do not reflect this recognition. "When it comes to quantitative models, they only consider transformational changes in technology, but assume business as usual economic trajectories," Tejal Kanitkar, the lead author of the Climate Policy paper and associate professor in the Energy, Environment, and Climate Change Programme at India's National Institute of Advanced Studies tells African Arguments. "This is a blinkered approach to modelling as well as to what is actually needed for climate action."

She adds that even in scenarios with marginally better outcomes for Africa, the projected incomes are still far below levels that would be required to meet the Sustainable Development Goals even as late as 2050.

More broadly, the scenario results indicate that developed countries will continue emitting above their fair allocation of the global carbon budget. Consequently, the burden of mitigation falls disproportionately on developing countries.

Experts, including authors of IPCC reports, warn that models premised on continuing inequalities and poverty risk producing policies that maintain those inequities.

Youba Sokona, the former vice chair of the IPCC suggests that such modelling approaches "perpetuate a cycle of poverty and under-development", hindering progress towards achieving sustainable development goals and improving the well-being of populations in countries in the Global South.

"I consider these scenarios as neo-colonialist," says Yamina Saheb, a researcher at Sciences Po and one of the lead authors of Chapter 9 on mitigation in AR6. She criticises the fact that the models do not seek a convergence between the Global North and South in terms of housing, mobility, and quality food.

The AGNES meeting in March concluded with a request to the modelling community to design models that incorporate a convergence in per capita energy consumption and living standards between the Global South and Global North. Participants called for future reports to better consider principles of common but differentiated responsibilities.

"A disproportionate burden on the Global South"

The IPCC report contains numerous modelled pathways through which the world can meet goals such as limiting temperature rise to 1.5C or 2C. These projections are drawn using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which incorporate myriad factors such as GDP growth, energy consumption, land-use change, and climate science to chart possible futures. IAMs are meant to provide a comprehensive framework to guide policymakers on climate action.

One effect of scenarios that project continued inequalities is that they assume the Global North will continue high carbon emissions despite the fact that many developed countries have already far exceeded their fair share of the global carbon budget. Policies for reducing emissions based on these models therefore put the burden on developing countries to keep their emissions low to compensate for rich countries' excess appropriation.

According to these scenarios, North America and Europe end up with near-term mitigation burdens similar to those in their national climate plans - or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - of around a 50-55% reduction in emissions by 2030. By contrast, Africa is required to reduce emissions by 80%.

These models, according to the Climate Policy study, also suggest developing countries will undertake more carbon sequestration - from carbon sinks such as forests and the deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies - than developed countries.

The authors conclude that the IPCC models "disregard the notion of historical responsibility of the Global North".

Another study last month, published in Environmental Science and Policy, resulted in similar findings. It found that land-based mitigation pathways like afforestation and reforestation modelled in AR6 place "a disproportionate burden on the Global South".

A major equity-based critique of IAMs is that they prioritise the lowest-cost solutions which end up placing the burden of mitigation on poorer countries. This is because the costs of setting up a solar plant or undertaking afforestation in India or some African countries, for instance, are typically lower than in the US or European Union. "The models prioritise short-term cost minimisation without adequately considering the long-term implications for development and equity," says Sokona.

"A paradigm shift"

The principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, which state that rich historic polluters have a greater responsibility for addressing climate change, are enshrined in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Kanitkar says that if IPCC mitigation scenarios violate these tenets, "they cannot be considered policy relevant inputs to global climate policy discussions".

Sokona suggests that to ensure scenarios adhere to these principles, "a paradigm shift in climate modelling and policy-making" is needed. He says a new framework for modelling must "explicitly" incorporate principles of climate equity, justice, and historical responsibility. He adds that new approaches should better reflect the diverse realities and priorities of countries in the Global South by including qualitative factors such as social equity, human development, and sustainable livelihoods alongside quantitative indicators.

Scientists also agree that trust in modelling approaches should be rebuilt through greater transparency. IAMs are produced based on various assumptions, which could be stated openly because, Kanitkar says, "the lack of such transparency is not only misleading; at a more fundamental level it is also bad science".

"The new framework should prioritise open access to data, methodologies, and assumptions, allowing for scrutiny and validation by the broader scientific community and stakeholders," adds Sokona.

Finally, experts in the Global South point to a need for diversity and inclusion in the modelling community. Almost all IAMs are currently developed in the Global North in institutions based in countries like Switzerland, Germany, and the US. "While this may not be the critical reason for scenarios to lack equity, the pervasiveness of the absence of equity raises serious questions about the lack of diversity in the model building community, including the absence of perspectives from the global South," says the Climate Policy paper.

Saheb also warns that there may be an element of group-think at play. She notes that the chapter of AR6 that contains the mitigation scenarios is dominated by authors working for institutions party to the Integrated Assessment Modelling Consortium. This means that the people who assess the pathways to decide if they should be included in the IPCC reports are linked to those who develop those models.

Equity-based critiques are an ongoing issue at COP negotiations and IPCC sessions. At COP28 last year, many country groupings like the African Group of Nations and Like Minded Developing Countries emphasised inequities in modelling. The next session of the IPCC is scheduled to be held this July where equity-based critiques of modelling approaches are again expected to be discussed.

Financing the SDGs in Small Island Developing States

First, the good news

TD 
	

According to the UNDP Human Development Report (HDR) 2023/2024 "Breaking the gridlock: Reimagining cooperation in a polarized world", two Small Island Developing States (SIDS) continue to excel on the human development index, with Mauritius ranking high at 72nd globally with an HDI of 0.796, and the Seychelles at 0.802, ranking very high in the 67th position out of 193 nations. These achievements are no mean feat. Both countries have invested in education, universal access to healthcare and are both leaders in climate action, aiming to build resilience to the significant environmental shocks that are inherent to life in a Small Island Developing State.

The HDR also notes that when adjusted for inequality in income and gender, both Mauritius and Seychelles show a loss in their HDI ranking. And so, there is more work to be done for these countries to continue their positive trajectory towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The last mile - financing the SDGs

The HDR proposes a reimagining of the 21st century international cooperation architecture towards global goods enabling transfer of resources from rich countries to poorer ones.

But there is a problem. For Mauritius and Seychelles, ranked as upper middle-income and high income, respectively, they are precluded from accessing concessional financing within the current official development assistance and international finance architecture. This means that notwithstanding their HDI ranking, they continue to grapple with securing the necessary finance at affordable rates to invest in reducing inequality and addressing the existential threats posed by climate change. The paradox is that the more successful they become in some areas, the less likely they are to gain support where they need it most.

The Capital As Force for Good The Solutions to the SDG Gap 2023 report suggests that achieving the SDGs now requires US$132-175 trillion. This is a significant increase from the projected US$80-112 trillion in 2015, when the goals were first adopted. The projected global funding shortfall is a staggering US$103-137 trillion, which requires 20 percent of annual global GDP. To close this gap, there is need to access about 40 percent of the US$440 trillion in global gross liquid assets, but current efforts to bridge the public-private financing gap still fall short, particularly for countries like Mauritius and Seychelles where the international finance architecture still limits access.

What can be done?

Financing the SDGs requires a reallocation of existing investments, mobilizing new capital, and reprioritizing spending for impact. And for countries like Mauritius and Seychelles, alternative sources of finance must be found. According to the 2022 Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) the impact investing market in 2022 stood at US$ 1.164 trillion in assets. Given the escalating vulnerabilities and increasing fiscal deficits, SIDS like Mauritius and Seychelles could pursue impact investment.

Where wealth owners are either inadequately informed about opportunities in the global south, where their money can be invested sustainably and profitably, or the finance architecture disadvantages some jurisdictions see as too risky an investment, there is a need to drive the impact investment narrative. There are clear opportunities to invest in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, conservation, and basic services such as housing, healthcare, and education. This approach, however, requires consensus among stakeholders who own, manage, host, and trade capital.

Finding cheap money

According to the GIIN report, over 50 percent of liquid wealth is held by individuals, driving almost 60 percent of global GDP and is disproportionately concentrated in the global north with limited mechanisms to channel it to the global south. A substantial portion of this wealth, US$315 trillion (88 percent), is also managed by the finance industry, including pension funds, while US$196 trillion in total assets is directly controlled by corporations. But for the global south, and Africa in particular, the cost of capital continues to exceed other regions. According to the OECD 2023 analysis regarding Africa's Development Dynamics, the average cost of capital for energy projects in 2021 was about seven times higher in Africa than in Europe and North America. This is despite higher returns in Africa.

According to an April 2023 UNDP study "Lowering the Cost of Borrowing in Africa - The Role of Sovereign Credit Ratings" part of the story is about unfair and adverse credit ratings based on subjective or unreliable data, which often drive a higher perception of risk. At the same time, reliability of data needs to be addressed, as it remains a significant barrier to new investments. Dialogue between governments and the private sector on legal, policy, and institutional mechanisms to lower the cost of capital, and investing in more and better data is also essential to reduce transaction costs, improve sustainability assessments, and increase investor confidence.

Impact investment through SDG investor maps

In the meantime, closing the financing gap is also possible through proven solutions that can be scaled, replicated, or leveraged. Amongst SIDS there are examples of innovative finance that could serve as beacons for the region. The UNDP has partnered with Mauritius and the Seychelles to launch an SDG Investor Maps the first such maps in SIDS. They provide insight into Investment Opportunity Areas and prospective rates of return. The maps also emphasize the role the private sector in financing sustainable development. Promoting access to private finance is an indispensable aspect of attaining the SDGs and at the heart of our call for joint action.

The UN 4th International Conference on Small Island Developing States 27 - 20 May 2924 in Antigua and Barbuda offers a clear opportunity for a collective position of access to finance for SIDS in line with the theme "Charting the Course Toward Resilient Prosperity".

HD 	Industrial Policy, East or West, for Development or War?

Developing countries wanting to pursue industrial policy were severely reprimanded by advocates of the 'neoliberal' Washington Consensus. Now, it is being deployed as a weapon in the new Cold War.

Industrial policy vs colonialism

TD 
	

Industrial policy is often seen as pioneered by Friedrich List. But List was inspired by George Washington's first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton. He advocated promoting manufacturing as the Industrial Revolution was beginning in England.

For List, post-colonial national development required tariffs. Despite a title deceptively similar to his earlier Principles of the Natural Economy, List's Principles of the National Economy was quite different, clearly inspired by Hamilton.

The Meiji Restoration started in 1868, after a quarter millennium of Tokugawa shogunate military rule. Meiji emperor rule was no mere palace coup but involved industrial policy to catch up with the already industrialising West.

Meanwhile, public intellectuals like Dadabhai Naoroji and Sayyid Jamaluddin al-Afghani rejected Western imperialism. They criticised how parts of the global South were being transformed - and ruined - by Western imperialism.

Half a century later, Harvard's Josef Schumpeter rejected the idea that capitalism had become imperialistic. The Austrian economist insisted imperialism was a pre-capitalist atavism that capitalism's ascendance would wipe out.

Weaponising industrial policy

Today's geopolitics has seen a renewed Western interest in industrial policy as a weapon in the new Cold War. US President Joe Biden's National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, is widely credited with articulating its use as an economic weapon.

This contrasts significantly with longstanding interest in industrial policy in the global South over several decades. For many, industrial policy has long been associated with post-colonial development efforts.

Meanwhile, strong stagnation tendencies in the West after the 2008 global financial crisis underscored the failure of purported neoliberalism. Advocacy of transformative, including green industrial policies by Mariana Mazzucato and others in Europe, was well received by desperate governments keen to resume growth.

Developmental, industrial policy

However, in developing countries, there has long been interest in developmental industrial policy. Neoliberal economists and the many influential financial institutions they control have long frowned upon this.

Alfred Marshall, Petrus Johannes Verdoorn, Nicholas Kaldor and others urged Europe to industrialise. Selective industrial policy has been even more controversial, with the government favouring some manufacturing activities over others, e.g., due to increasing returns to scale.

Typically facing resource, including fiscal constraints, developing countries have had little choice but to be selective. However, with such powers associated with governments, there was understandable concern about the potential for abuse, arbitrariness and error.

Instead, the market was supposed to decide in the best interests of society without recognising its own inherent biases and 'failures', especially in highly unequal post-colonial societies. Neoliberal economists were quick to caricature industrial policy with dismissive metaphors (e.g., picking winners) rather than rigorous analysis.

Asian miracles?

The East Asian Miracle was simplistically caricatured due to the abandonment of import-substituting industrialisation in favour of export-orientation. A more nuanced alternative narrative of 'effective protection conditional on export promotion' in Northeast Asia was thus ignored.

Industrial policy is much more than trade policy, involving a range of policy instruments. Recognising the variegated aspects, dimensions and tools of industrial policy is essential. Besides investment, finance, and technology, human resource development is also significant.

For instance, the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) were an important initiative to support its industry. However, with India's gradual neglect of industrial policy, IITs have probably contributed more to the development of US hi-tech.

Evaluating industrial policy

For years, economists working on India have criticised industrial policy, usually referring to the Nehruvian experience. But rushing to such a conclusion solely referencing that experience requires cherry-picking evidence.

India's pharmaceutical policy has been crucial to the health and well-being of its population. Affordable, often generic medicines in India have been central to its improved public health outcomes. However, unlike Western pharmaceutical transnational corporations, Indian companies have not been accused of price-gouging.

Bangladesh has since utilised its special dispensation as a least developed country (LDC) to export affordable generic medicines to many other poor countries. However, the West blocked the Indian-South African initiative to suspend patent royalties to address the COVID-19 pandemic for its duration.

Effectively, the West was reneging on its 2001 agreement to the Public Health Exception to Trade-Related Industrial Property Rights (TRIPS). This compromise was needed to restart WTO processes after the African walkout from the 1999 Seattle World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting.

If not for India and Bangladesh, the costs of medicines would have been much higher, and there would be more ill health in the world today. Defining industrial policy success solely in terms of the financial profitability of investments ignores such gains.

It is, therefore, crucial to build coalitions to create the conditions for sustained and appropriate but adaptive industrial policies. These are needed to accelerate growth and structural transformation to achieve sustainable development in the face of stagnation and regression in much of the world, especially the global South.

HD 	Global South Stagnating Under Heavier Debt Burden

Much higher interest rates - due to Western central banks - are suffocating developing nations, especially the poorest, causing prolonged debt distress and economic stagnation.

US Fed-induced stagnation

TD 
	

After the greatest US Fed-led surge in international interest rates in more than four decades, developing countries spent $443.5 billion to service their external government and government-guaranteed debt in 2022.

The World Bank's last International Debt Report showed most of the poorest countries in debt distress as borrowing costs began to surge. The increase has cut into scarce fiscal resources, reducing social spending on health and education.

Debt-servicing costs for all developing countries in 2022 increased by 5% over 2021. The US Fed continued to raise interest rates through 2023, compounding debt distress, while the European Central Bank warns against 'prematurely' lowering interest rates.

Poorest worst off

The 75 countries eligible to borrow from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) - which only lends to the world's poorest - paid $88.9 billion to service debt in 2022.

Over the last decade, the cumulative debt of IDA-eligible countries grew faster than their economies. Their foreign debt stock reached $1.1 trillion in 2022 - more than twice that in 2012. During 2012-22, their external debt rose 134%, over twice the 53% increase in national income.

Interest payments by the poorest countries have quadrupled over the previous decade to $23.6 billion in 2022. The Bank expects debt-servicing by the 24 poorest countries to jump by as much as 39% in 2023 and 2024.

Growing debt distress

Bank Chief Economist cum Senior Vice President Indermit Gill has warned, "Record debt levels and high-interest rates have set many countries on a path to crisis". "Every quarter that interest rates stay high results in more developing countries becoming distressed..."

Without "quick and coordinated action by debtor governments, private and official creditors, and multilateral financial institutions" and "better debt sustainability ... and swifter restructuring" arrangements, "another lost decade" seems unavoidable!

Higher interest rates have worsened debt distress in most developing countries. There have been 18 government debt defaults in ten developing countries in the last three years - more than in the previous two decades!

Poorest hardest hit

About three-fifths of low-income countries (LICs) are in or at high risk of debt distress. Debt service payments consume an increasingly large share of their export earnings. Over a third of their external debt has variable interest rates, which have risen sharply over the last two years.

The Bank acknowledges, "Many of these countries face an additional burden: the accumulated principal, interest, and fees they incurred for the privilege of debt-service suspension under the G-20's Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI)."

With higher Fed rates, the stronger US dollar worsens developing countries' difficulties, raising debt-servicing costs. Besides high interest rates, falling export earnings - due to lower demand - are worsening things.

Where have all the lenders gone?

New financing for the global South has dried up with the flight of capital 'uphill' to the North. New borrowing has been made harder by interest rate and debt-servicing cost increases.

New government and government-guaranteed foreign loan commitments to these countries fell by 23% to $371 billion in 2022 - the lowest in a decade.

Private creditors have been avoiding developing countries and got $185 billion more in principal repayments than they loaned in 2022. It was the first year they received more than they loaned to developing countries since 2015.

New bonds issued by developing countries internationally dropped by over half in 2022! New bond issues by IDA-eligible LICs and other countries fell by more than three-quarters to $3.1 billion.

With much less private financing, multilateral development banks, especially the World Bank, loaned much more. Multilateral creditors provided $115 billion in new concessional financing to developing countries in 2022, with half from the Bank.

The Bank provided $16.9 billion more in such financing than it got in principal repayments - nearly thrice the amount a decade before. The Bank also disbursed $6.1 billion in grants to these countries, three times the amount in 2012.

Wrong medicine

As the US Fed continued to hike interest rates through 2023 while the European Central Bank still warns against 'prematurely' reversing the rate hikes, the prospects of early relief appear remote, threatening further devastation in the global South.

The excuse for higher interest rates remains inflation above the completely arbitrary two per cent inflation targeting rate now embraced by all too many central bankers as their 'holy grail'.

But most recent inflation has been due to often deliberate supply-side disruptions in recent years associated with the US-led new Cold War, COVID-19 pandemic disruptions and geopolitically driven economic sanctions, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Core inflation has largely receded in much of the world since mid-2022. But meanwhile, imported inflation has been exacerbated by exchange rate depreciation due to financial flow-induced refluxes¬.

No solution on the horizon

The 1980s' government debt crises caused a 'lost decade' in Latin America and a quarter century of stagnation in Sub-Saharan Africa. It took almost a decade for the George H W Bush administration to resolve the Latin American debt crises with compromises around the Brady bonds.

This time, a resolution will be much more difficult owing to the varied creditors and much larger debt involved. Worse, there is little sense of responsibility in the West. Instead of seeking collective solutions, the evolving debt crisis is used to blame and isolate China in the fast-worsening geopolitical new Cold War.

After a year that juxtaposed unprecedented crises with rising global influence in the Global South, the Group of 77 (G77) convened in Kampala, Uganda on 21 January for its Third South Summit. The two-day meeting - only the third in the G77's sixty-year history and the first to be held in Africa - saw high-level political leaders and representatives from over 130 member states explore solutions to fuel inclusive, sustainable growth in the developing world.

Under the theme of "Leaving No One Behind," the Summit notably focused on boosting 'South-South' collaboration in trade, investment and climate action amid the new opportunities presented by shifting global power dynamics. Alluding to this emerging reality in his G77 address, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres further emphasised that this expanding cooperation "does not replace the need" for a robust Global North contribution to the SDG agenda.

TD 
	

Moving forward, closing widening socioeconomic and climate resilience gaps will require bolstered North-South and public-private partnerships to drive up international investment and trade in developing countries' high-growth, climate-mitigating sectors.

East Africa's model for Global South

Given its place at the global intersection of climate change, food insecurity and economic opportunity, Uganda - and East Africa more broadly - offered a fitting venue for the G77 to map out the Global South's future.

According to the World Food Programme, climate change-driven droughts and desertification in recent years have pushed over 23 million people in the Horn of Africa - including Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia - into a hunger crisis. Repeated failed harvests in the region have been severely exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, whose disruption of vital grain exports created a roughly 30 million-ton food shortage, while combining with the Sudan conflict to trigger 40% food inflation in East Africa last year.

With climate change models suggesting a disastrous long-term impact on Africa's food systems, White & Case has rightly observed that future-proof agriculture will be "at the core of the continent's economic transformation" and resilience efforts. Africa boasts the world's fastest-growing agricultural economy and 60% of the world's uncultivated arable land, with East Africa at the hyper centre of this transition.

Last August, the African Development Bank projected that, at a rate of over 5%, East Africa would lead the continent in economic growth throughout 2023 and 2024, with the report highlighting the joint efforts of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania and more recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) analysis forecasting a similarly encouraging agriculture-driven growth in Burundi.

In the Eastern African Community (EAC) - an intergovernmental organisation whose membership includes the aforementioned countries as well as the DRC, South Sudan and newly-joined Somalia - the agricultural sector accounts for 25-40% of member states' GDP and over 80% of regional employment, while the bloc's EAC Vision 2050 highlights agriculture as the region's key long-term driver of socioeconomic prosperity.

Innovative entrepreneurs offering sustainable farming blueprint

As World Bank economists recently posited, Eastern Africa has the potential to become "not only self-sufficient but also a prominent food exporter," a view that featured prominently at the recent World Economic Forum. At Davos, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken promoted the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS), a newly-launched partnership initiative between the US, AU and FAO that involves "investing above ground, identifying the indigenous African crops that are...most resilient to climate change" and "delivering them to the world" while "investing below ground" to boost soil resilience and lay an "agricultural foundation for the future."

In the international collaborative effort to deliver on this approach, the private sector has a vital role to play, with entrepreneurs like Gaetano Buglisi and Tonthoza Uganja bringing visions onto the scene which could be particularly well-adapted to East Africa's sustainable farming revolution.

Upon launching his first agri-business ventures, Gaetano Buglisi, an Italian entrepreneur active in a number of sectors including renewable energy and forest conservation, developed an innovative model combining digital technologies with ecologically-sound techniques to cultivate abandoned and degraded farmland in the south of his native Italy. Buglisi identified several varieties of fruit with high nutritional value, such as pomegranates, that could thrive in this hostile ground, while incorporating Agriculture 4.0 practices like sensor-assisted micro-irrigation to boost yields, reduce water usage and support long-term soil recovery - all highly-relevant to African farmers' current needs. What's more, through training and employment opportunities, Buglisi's agri-food projects have empowered local communities to generate sustainable growth from their natural resources.

Meanwhile, Tonthoza Uganja's extensive experience as a land restoration and sustainable agroforestry start-up founder offers a similarly relevant blueprint for East Africa's farming sector. Hailing from Malawi, Uganja founded the social entreprise Sustainable Farming Solutions (SFS) in 2019 after nearly a decade of working with small-scale farmers in the private sector. Through SFS, Uganja has identified and invested in Malawian communities with high biodiversity value yet hindered by degraded land, notably providing rural women farmers with a package of sustainable farming and finance solutions to restore their communities' ecosystems and expand their products' market access.

Expanding to global markets

This last point is crucial - East Africa's small and medium-scale farmers remain greatly limited to their immediately local markets, while individual farmers lack the centralised trading entities needed to join forces and thereby boost bargaining power on the international market.

While the EAC itself provides an attractive regional market, expanding trade to a fully-operational African Continental Free Trade Area would allow the former's member-states to band together and build a highly-competitive industry that would also help meet rising food demand and bolster the region's resilience to recent global supply chain shocks, as the World Bank has noted.

Looking further abroad, the United States has increasing ambitions for trade with Africa, including a likely extension and enhancement of its free trade-enabling African Growth and Opportunity Act beyond 2025, as well as the developing Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) with the EAC to build on its member-states' existing Tifas. And with Brussels following close behind - as reflected by the historic EU-Kenya trade agreement inked in December - the region has a host of promising avenues to accelerate growth.

By capitalising on these emerging opportunities for international trade and investment in its agricultural sector, East Africa could offer the Global South an inspiring and replicable sustainable development model as the G77 bloc looks to the future. Based on its landmark Third Summit, the G77's members are coming together behind the right vision to assume a more prominent role on the world's economic and diplomatic stages.

The 37th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union (AU) kicked off on Saturday 17 February 2024. Holding under the theme: "Educate an African fit for the 21st Century: Building Resilient Education Systems for Increased Access to Inclusive, Lifelong, Quality, and Relevant Learning in Africa", the event at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was well attended by African Heads of state and Government, and high-level representatives from the African continent and beyond.

The event witnessed the election of H.E Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania as the Chairperson of the Union for 2024, taking over the baton of command from outgoing Chair, H.E Azali Assoumani, President of the Union of Comoros.

Key speakers during the official opening ceremony included H.E. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the AU Commission, H.E. Dr. Abiy Ahmed, Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, H.E Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, H.E Ahmed Aboul Gheit ,the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, the Prime Minister of Palestine H.E Mohammad Shyyyeh, and the outgoing Chairperson of the Union, the President of the Union of Comoros H.E Azali Assoumani.

The Assembly started with a moment of silence in honor of the memory of the late Namibian President H.E Hage Geingob. Taking the floor, the outgoing Chair of the Union, President Assoumani, presented a comprehensive report of the achievements and activities undertaken on behalf of the AU during his leadership. He noted successes in peace and security, socio-economic development, youth and women's empowerment, Africa speaking with one voice and taking common positions on global issues, enhancement of infrastructure, agriculture, climate change, education, health, and ICTs among others. He called for peace in the Middle East, reiterating the need for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.

In his welcome remarks, Ethiopian Prime Minister H.E. Dr Abiy Ahmed, underscored the importance of creating strong regional and continental platforms, emphasizing that these platforms are essential for addressing national development challenges from geopolitical, logistical, and security standpoints. He commended the African Union for its accession to the G20, as "marking a significant milestone" on the global stage.

Addressing the Assembly, AUC Chairperson, H.E. Moussa Faki Mahamat highlighted some critical concerns facing the continent, including peace, political and institutional instability, climate change, economic governance deficits, integration challenges, poverty, and the marginalization of women and youth in development and leadership processes. He stressed the urgent need for Member States to proactively engage with these issues, underscoring their importance in achieving the aspirations of Agenda 2063 for a transformed and prosperous Africa.

"We are now strongly challenged by the urgency of clear positions on this set of issues, at the heart of the emergence of our organization and our continent. The strengthening of our unity and the intensification of our struggles require a new start, a true renaissance of nationalism and Pan Africanism", said the AUC Chairperson.

In highlighting the continent's progress, H.E. Faki commended the successful advancement of institutional reforms and the strides made in regional integration, notably through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). He expressed satisfaction with the progress made in some areas including the Peace Fund, the African Common Positions on climate change, the reform of global governance, the financing of African peace keeping missions, and the notable accession of the AU to the G20 Forum.

The Secretary General of the League of Arab States and the Prime Minister of Palestine, highlighted peace and security concerns, calling for an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. They also called for win-win strategic partnerships, economic development, and inclusive quality education, which is the African Union theme of the year 2024, among others.

"The Global South is becoming an unavoidable part of the solution to the main crises that afflict this planet.... Only an inclusive social project will allow us to establish prosperous, free, democratic, and sovereign societies," Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stressed during the opening of the AU Assembly. President Lula offered to support the efforts of the African continent in closing the digital gap, and reiterated his country's readiness to help advance technology, ensuring that governance mechanisms for Artificial Intelligence (AI) reflect the perspectives of the Global South.

"The country (Brazil) has committed to facilitating improved dialogue between the G20 and the High-Level Panel set up by the UN Secretary-General. The aim of this initiative is to stimulate discussions about the Global Digital Compact, focusing on creating effective, equitable, and wide-reaching governance frameworks to support Africa's digital transformation", he noted. President Lula further highlighted climate as a critical priority ahead of COP 30, stating, "Our priority also includes the health of our planet. The urgent need to protect the world's two largest tropical rainforests, located in the Amazon and Congo basins, positions us as key players in the climate agenda. There is no global south without Africa. He went on to say that "rekindling Brazil's relationship with Africa involves reclaiming our historical connections and playing a significant role in shaping a new, more equitable, and supportive global order. Most importantly, it paves the way for us to unite in addressing the forthcoming challenges."

As the AU's highest decision making body, the Assembly is deliberating and deciding on various issues of continental priority including the progress of the institutional and financial reforms of the Union, which include the operationalization of the African Union Peace Fund; the Panel of Eminent Africans to oversee the pre-selection of candidatures for Members of the Commission ahead of the upcoming AU Commission elections in 2025; the progress report on the implementation of the AfCFTA as the theme of the year 2023; progress on the operationalization of the Africa CDC, and the establishment and operationalization of the African Medicines Agency (AMA), among others.

The two-day meeting will also look at several reports by AU organs and specialized agencies as well as reports of the various sub-committees of the African Union looking into matters of multilateral cooperation; human rights and governance; refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons; economic and trade matters among others. Reports of the various Specialized Technical Committees of the AU that focus on thematic areas such as gender equality and women's empowerment; education, science and technology, agriculture, rural development water and environment; transport, regional infrastructure and energy; and justice and legal affairs will also be tabled.

The 37th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government ends on 18 February 2024, with the adoption of the decisions, declarations, and resolutions of the Summit.

HD 	The South Must Unite to End Debt and Shape a New Economic Order

The inequities of the global financial system have changed little for decades. What's new, with the climate crisis, is the urgency of fixing them.

On 4 February 1975, Senegal's then President Leopold Senghor declared to a meeting of the non-aligned states: "We in the third world have to use our natural resources to break the traditional patterns of world trade...This conference must above all define the objectives of the new economic order and adopt methods of realising these objectives."

TD 
	

Nearly half a century later, at the UN General Assembly in September 2021, Senghor's successor Macky Sall expressed a similar sentiment: "Our countries cannot achieve an energy transition and abandon the polluting patterns of the industrialised countries without a viable, fair and equitable alternative...Our countries, which are already shouldering the crushing weight of unequal trade, cannot bear the burden of an unfair energy transition."

What happened between these speeches?

On one front, not very much. The imbalances of power associated with the extraction of natural resources remain largely unchanged. Decades on from Senghor's speech, raw materials continue to be controlled and exploited in the Global South and exported to the Global North where they fuel industrial development.

On the other hand, we are living in a very different context to former president Senghor. Since his day, the extraction of natural resources has increased dramatically, with troubling ecological consequences. In 1975, Earth Overshoot Day - the date by which humanity uses up all the biological resources the Earth regenerates in a year - was 4 December. By 2021, it was 30 July. Today, we live in the midst of an escalating climate crisis.

This has made the uncorrected inequities of the global system even more urgent and concerning. As Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados said in April 2023: "The world is running out of time to fix its international financial system that is broken, outdated, infested with short termism, and downright unfair. Too many countries are being prevented from fighting the climate crisis and from creating decent opportunities for billions of people - their citizens. If countries cannot access the finance they need at rates they can afford, the world will lose the battle, not simply the countries."

Indeed, many countries in the Global South are both among the most vulnerable to climate change and the most disadvantaged by the international financial system. A report found that climate vulnerability has already raised the cost of debt for developing countries by tens of billions of dollars in extra interest payments. These are the same countries that have contributed the least to the climate crisis and continue to have the lowest emissions. It takes the average American just two and a half days to emit the same amount of CO2 as the average Ugandan emits in a year.

A viable, fair, and equitable energy transition to tackle climate change is impossible in an unequal and uneven international financial system. That is why, following the G77+China summit in Uganda this January, Debt for Climate Uganda organised a dialogue on Global South perspectives on climate change, debt, and the New International Economic Order. Experts from academia, policy circles, diplomatic corps, and climate activists discussed the role of the G77 - a group of 134 countries in the Global South - in calling for debt cancellation and shaping a new international economic order and global financial architecture.

Participants came up with three urgent calls for the G77 and international community:

1) Revive the New International Economic Order, proposed by the G77 in 1974, to address unsustainable debt burdens

As the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), a coalition of 58 highly vulnerable countries, expressed in July 2023, the existing system "does not enable all countries in distress to receive treatment, does not compel all creditor classes to participate, and is not linked to climate and development goals, but appears to only focus on stabilisation".

The result is that countries are unable to mobilise resources for development and positive climate action. Comprehensive and fair debt cancellation would free nations from the shackles of debt repayments and enable them to invest in sustainable development, climate resilience, and the well-being of their citizens.

2) End neo-colonialism and stop the unvirtuous cycle of indebtedness

According to the 2023 Financing for Sustainable Development Report, 52 developing economies - home to half the world's population living in extreme poverty - are either in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress. As well as debt cancellation, this cycle can be stopped, and countries can be enabled to develop climate actions, by scaling up climate-for-debt swaps. These arrangements allow countries to reduce their debt obligations in exchange for a commitment to finance domestic climate projects with the freed-up financial resources.

3) End fossil fuel production and green colonialism through a just transition

Tackling climate change requires phasing out fossil fuels. Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) have been established for some coal-dependent emerging economies through which industrialised countries have agreed to support developing countries (e.g. South Africa) to move away from coal while addressing the consequences for affected workers and communities. However, these plans have two key shortfalls: the amount of money is very small; and it mainly comes in the form of loans, which simply adds to unvirtuous cycle of indebtedness.

We advocate for a reform of JETPs to significantly increase funding and shift from loans to grants. In addition, we call for a planned and fair global fossil fuel phase-out that addresses the inequalities between Global North and Global South with an initiation of a global registry of fossil fuel reserves as a starting point.

The urgency of climate action cannot be overstated. The Global South bears a disproportionate burden of the impacts of climate change, affecting livelihoods, ecosystems, and future generations. We call the international community and the G77 to take on these three urgent and essential actions.

Eriga Reagan Elijah is the Co-Founder of Debt For Climate Uganda. Dianey Mugalizi is the regional coordinator of Debt For Climate Africa. Vanessa Nakate is the founder of the Rise Up Movement and a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Pierre Wokuri is a doctor in political science at the Rennes Institute of Political Studies, France.

HD 	Climate-Smart Farming Gets Funding Boost at COP28, But Small Farmers Still Struggle

Despite not securing a phase-out of fossil fuels, COP28 witnessed a historic focus on food. The summit saw over $7 billion in funding commitments, as well as a pledge by 152 countries to include food and agriculture in their climate plans.

TD 
	

There is no doubt that commercial agriculture is a major contributor to the climate crisis, responsible for around a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to Greenpeace. This includes emissions from land use change, on-farm production, processing, transport, packaging, and retail. With the world's population expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, issues around food security and environmental impact are only likely to escalate.

While funding commitments for climate-smart agriculture at COP28 offers a glimmer of hope, it remains to be seen how much of it will materialize. Right now the heatwaves, floods, and droughts are no longer distant warnings, but a lived experience for millions of people.

Transforming food systems - A Malawian perspective on COP28 and beyond

Dr. Betty Chinyamunyamu is a force to be reckoned with in the Malawian agricultural landscape. As the CEO of the National Smallholder Farmers Association of Malawi (NASFAM), she leads the largest independent smallholder-owned association in the country, empowering over 100,000 members. Her passion for sustainable agriculture and her dedication to supporting smallholder farmers are evident in her work.

With the COP28 commitment to addressing the challenges in food systems, Dr. Chinyamunyamu offers a grounded perspective from the heart of Malawian agriculture. While she acknowledges the potential of these initiatives, she emphasizes the need for practical implementation that considers the realities of smallholder farmers.

In the past few years, smallholder farmers in Malawi have been severely affected by the impacts of the climate crisis.

"For example over the past two years, there have been four severe cyclones that have devastated communities with many farmlands being lost," she said. "Consequently, the smallholders are eager to adopt any practices and innovations that are meant to assist them. However, what is important is that the farmers must fully comprehend the initiatives. What this means therefore is that the smallholders must be involved in all processes related to the initiatives. They need to participate in their development as well as monitor their effectiveness and not only be involved in their implementation. It is those initiatives where the smallholders are taken as full participants in the initiatives and not mere beneficiaries that more effectiveness is achieved.

"Smallholders must also be adequately trained so that they understand the principles well enough. There must also be an effort to translate all relevant communication into vernacular languages so that the smallholders can easily understand," she said.

Dr. Chinyamunyamu pointed out that Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is not just about farming, it's about building resilience in the face of a changing climate.

"Climate-smart agriculture is an integrated farming practice that incorporates sustainable production practices to enhance resilience and reduce environmental impact. It involves using climate-resilient crops and crop varieties, efficient soil and water management, and precision farming to adapt to changing conditions and mitigate climate change effects on agriculture," she said.

"Beyond adapting, CSA mitigates climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture," said Chinyamunyamu.

"This three-pronged approach aims to not only boost yields and farmer incomes but also build resilience against climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture."

Dr. Chinyamunyamu painted a clear picture of how developing nations can unlock their full potential in tackling climate challenges. "It's not just about securing funds," she said, "but about building the capacity to utilize and manage them effectively." She emphasized the crucial role of strong governance, advocating for "robust institutions that can steward resources and monitor their impact." Enhanced transparency, she believes, is equally vital, "building trust and attracting diverse funding sources, empowering nations to chart their own climate-resilient course." Beyond structures, Dr. Chinyamunyamu highlighted the importance of "capacity-building programs and partnerships", equipping nations to "access, manage, and allocate funds effectively for impactful climate initiatives".

How the $100 billion climate finance gap hinders progress

Dr. Chinyamunyamu added that "the struggle to meet the $100 billion annual commitment in the Paris Agreement is casting a long shadow over our fight against climate change."

The $100 billion goal, set in 2009 and reaffirmed in 2015, was meant to be a collective effort by developed nations to support developing countries in tackling climate challenges. It's a critical lifeline for nations facing rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and shifting agricultural patterns. Yet, despite repeated pledges, the actual flow of funds has fallen short. In 2020, developed countries only managed to mobilize $83.3 billion, leaving a significant gap.

This unmet promise, she argues, "cripples the ability of developing nations, who are often on the frontlines of climate impacts, to implement crucial adaptation and mitigation measures."

"The shortfall impacts developing nations' ability to implement adaptation and mitigation measures, and therefore negatively affecting the global fight against climate change," she said.

According to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the annual financing shortfall for adaptation alone now stands at $194 billion to $366 billion, with existing financial flows reaching just $25 billion during the 2017-2021 period. The UNEP estimated that developing countries required $215-$387 billion per year until 2030 to adapt to climate impacts, with the figure set to rise.

The enormous funding gaps in these countries must be covered mainly by long-term, low-cost, and accessible financial flows from international public sources. The report urges developed countries to commit to a minimum annual inflow to the fund and establish a separate goal for climate finance for Least Developed Countries, focusing predominantly on climate adaptation, with simplified access to funds.

As the dust settles from COP28, hope for a brighter future flickers in the eyes of smallholder farmers around the globe.

Dr. Chinyamunyamu sees precision agriculture, wielding data like a modern almanac, optimizing resources and yields. Climate-smart practices, like diverse crops and regenerative techniques, will heal the land. Resilient crops, born of innovation, will weather storms, while water wisdom, through drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting, will conquer scarcity.

She champions digital tools, empowering farmers with knowledge and market access, but reminds us: that technology is just a tool.

"Integrating digital tools, data analytics, and farmer-centric approaches are also very important and can significantly enhance the resilience and livelihoods of smallholder farmers," Dr. Chinyamunyamu added.

Can $200 million boost global food supply?

In the face of climate's harsh hand, climate-resilient farming sows the seeds of hope. By adopting climate-resilient agriculture practices like water harvesting and drought-resistant crops, farmers can build resilience against climate shocks and ensure their communities have food on the table.

Climate-smart agriculture needs a critical ingredient: funding.

For small farmers struggling to adapt to climate change and feed the world, the $200 million partnership announced at COP28 could be a game-changer.

The $200 million funding commitment by the government of the UAE, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, for the work of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and other organizations, unveiled at COP28 offers support for small farmers worldwide.

Small-scale farmers, who produce up to 70% of the food in developing countries, are central to transforming the food system. However, they receive only a tiny fraction of climate finance. The World Bank sounds a stark warning: Africa's broader socioeconomic development hinges on its ability to adapt and build resilience in agriculture. Without it, the continent's future prosperity hangs in the balance.

This partnership aims to accelerate the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices, strengthen research and development, and support policy and practice recommendations. True transformation requires not just money, but collaboration, innovation, and a resolute commitment to building a more resilient future.

Enock Chikava, the Interim Director of Agricultural Development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, echoes this sentiment. He oversees developing and deploying innovations that support small-scale farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the unsung heroes feeding a vulnerable world.

"What's needed are the investments to take proven innovations to scale, to make the leap from reaching thousands of farmers to reaching millions," Chikava said.

He underscored the double burden faced by small-scale farmers. "Climate threats to small-scale agriculture in Africa and South Asia are about more than food. They erode an economic sector that provides employment for the majority, particularly women. This is about poverty reduction, malnutrition, and women's economic opportunities."

"Many have come forward at COP28 to support CGIAR. However, investments in small-scale farmers remain low relative to the magnitude of the climate threat to food production. I think the challenge to ensuring sufficient financing is twofold."

"So, helping small-scale farmers adapt to climate change is essential for driving progress in areas like reducing poverty and malnutrition and increasing economic opportunities for women. Improving crop and livestock productivity - meaning producing more food without expanding farmlands - is also critical for protecting wildlife habitats and natural resources and reducing food-related emissions."

"Second, investors need to see that there are many proven innovations already available that can help farmers adapt, and many African farmers already are using them. What's needed are the investments to take them to scale, to make the leap from reaching thousands of farmers to reaching millions," added Chikava.

Chikava also expressed disappointment with COP28's progress.

"Support for small-scale farmers and adaptation is far below what's needed. Negotiations could have done much more to address the disparity between adaptation costs and available funding."

However, he was pleased to see new efforts emerge at COP28 to elevate the importance of agriculture innovation as an essential component of the fight against climate change. That included new support for CGIAR and its partners to expand access to solutions many farmers are already using to adapt.

"But support for small-scale farmers and adaptation in Global South countries is far below what's needed. Many leaders remain frustrated that there is still a significant gap between the rapidly rising costs of adaptation and available funding. COP28 negotiations could have done much more to address this disparity. The imbalance is especially troubling because these countries have contributed the least to causing climate change but are suffering first, and the most. This is a colossal climate injustice."

Chikava said: "We need to acknowledge a measure of progress at COP28 while also making it clear that we are still not where we need to be on adaptation. Ultimately, achieving impact requires donors to sustain and significantly enlarge existing commitments. It's also important for world leaders to embrace clear benchmarks for adaptation in areas like agriculture that can hold them accountable for achieving specific milestones.

"Just as targets for reducing emissions are oriented around an effort to keep warming from exceeding 1.5°C, we need to be investing in adaptation with a commitment to achieving clear, measurable levels of resilience for vulnerable communities. Because even in a best-case scenario for emissions reductions, it will take a long time for these cuts to slow the current pace of climate change," he said.

Chikava highlighted a key issue that needs solutions tailored to the realities of the Global South, particularly when it comes to crop choices.

"A fundamental challenge is to develop tools, technologies, and solutions that are fit for purpose," he said. "That means strategies that align with food production in the Global South - that target the crops and livestock farmers raise and the environments and climates where they thrive."

"For example," he said. "500 million Africans regularly consume cassava, and millions of farmers grow it. For decades, this crop did not get anywhere near the attention given to crops like maize, wheat, and rice. Yet cassava is an ideal crop for adapting to climate change because it will survive in hot, dry, and flood conditions that cause other crops to fail."

He emphasized the need for investments in proven innovations, pointing to CGIAR's work with drought-resistant cassava varieties that have boosted yields by 30-100%.

"We've supported a CGIAR partnership that is using advanced tools to supply African farmers with a new generation of improved cassava varieties. These varieties are helping farmers boost yields by 30 to 100%. They also provide resistance to cassava viruses that are spreading more rapidly due to climate change," he said.

Making climate-smart a reality

Chikava said some of the most promising solutions for helping farmers thrive in a changing climate are already hiding in plain sight.

"There are several popular, naturally hardy food crops widely cultivated in Africa and South Asia that can help farmers grow more with less. I mentioned cassava. The list also includes millets, pigeon pea, sweet potatoes, yams, teff, and sorghum. The common denominator is that they all have been neglected by major breeding programs and that has caused yields to stagnate and threats from crop diseases to intensify. But that's starting to change."

But the tide is turning, said Chikava.

"We're also supporting an effort to use computer simulations and weather monitoring satellites to provide African farmers with long-range climate forecasts to help them anticipate and navigate climate threats long before they happen. They can plant sorghum instead of maize if rains will be light, or adjust their planting times if the rainy season is not happening on schedule, which is increasingly the case," he said.

Why supporting smallholder farmers is now a top priority

"I think it has finally become clear that for regions like sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the climate crisis is largely being experienced as a  food and agriculture crisis," Chikava said.

In the wake of COP28, the focus on supporting smallholder farmers seems to have increased. Chikava isn't surprised by COP28's emphasis on supporting smallholder farmers.

"Small-scale farmers are experiencing significant losses, and that has major implications for food security and economic stability in some of the fastest-growing countries in the world."

"I'm optimistic that more people now understand that if we want to be serious about confronting climate change, we must pay more attention to the struggles of small-scale farmers - and to the many opportunities available to help them adapt," Chikava said.

- aim at strengthening infrastructure, corporation development

The People's Republic of China, through its Embassy in Liberia, has committed to China-Liberia relationship, especially in infrastructure and diplomatic partnership.

TD 
	

Chinese Ambassador to Liberia Mr. Yin Chengw, in a special article on China-Liberia Cooperation said that China and Liberia will continue to support each other, unite and collaborate, and continuously promote new achievements in China-Liberia cooperation.

According to him, the cooperation will write a magnificent new chapter for building a community with a shared future for mankind.

"Though separated by thousands of miles, China and Liberia share a common future, with many similar positions and ideas and a wide range of common interests," said the Chinese Envoy.

"As common members of developing countries, China and Liberia should continue to support each other, unite and collaborate, and continuously promote new achievements in China-Liberia cooperation, so as to write a new magnificent chapter for building a community with a shared future for mankind," he stated.

The Chinese Envoy further stated that it is within the framework of building a community with a shared future for mankind, President Xi has also put forth the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative that further respond to the universal aspirations of people of all countries for peace, development and cooperation, and providing Chinese solutions to the common problems faced by mankind.

The Chinese Ambassador to Liberia further called on the government and people of Liberia to listen to what he termed as the voice of the "global South."

[bsa_pro_ad_space id=1]

"Building a community with a shared future for mankind, the voice of the "global South", including those of China and Liberia, need to be listened."

"At a time when the world's unprecedented changes are accelerating, the voice of the "global South" is growing in strength, with a growing sense of solidarity and collaboration, which has a profound impact on world history," he added.

Ambassador Yin detailed that the call to listen to the voice of the "Global South" coincides with President Joseph Nyumah Boakai's inaugural speech in which he intimated that Liberia under his administration will foster South-South cooperation to address mutual developmental issues in the global South.

"A few days ago, President Joseph Nyuma Boakai mentioned in his inaugural speech that 'we also will foster South-South cooperation to address mutual developmental issues in the global South', which coincides with China's proposition," he indicated.

With Africa's strategic importance rising, India has leveraged the global trust deficit to become a trusted interlocutor.

India is rapidly forging an important role in the new global order as a bridge between the global north and south. Leveraging its economic muscle and newfound political clout as the self-appointed voice of the south, India has nimbly straddled multiple, divergent interests and fora.

TD 
	

In keeping with a 'multi-alignment' strategy, India has achieved several diplomatic victories, such as the African Union's (AU) inclusion in the G20 in September 2023. Central to this success has been the ability to empathise with divergent viewpoints while maintaining strategic autonomy.

For the West, India is an important bulwark against the China-Russia axis. The so-called Dragon-Bear alliance has become the primary concern to Western policymakers, given Beijing and Moscow's desire to disrupt the global liberal order. In this context, India's strategic importance has been elevated. It is the world's largest democracy, an important ally in counter-terrorism, a key economic trade partner of the West, and distrustful of China.

The fact that India shares assessments of the threats from an assertive China makes it a compelling ally for Western governments. This is evidenced by its inclusion in the Quad - a diplomatic and security partnership between Australia, India, Japan and the United States, structured to deter Chinese aggression. With India set to become the world's third largest economy by 2027, its rising economic stock gives the country additional gravitas in international affairs.

However, the relationship isn't without friction. The Ukraine war exposed significant divergences in world views. India refrained from publicly condemning Russia's invasion, refused to participate in sanctions against Moscow and continued buying Russian energy and arms despite Western pressure. India was steadfast in its position, arguing it would do what was right for the country, rather than kowtow to Western interests.

This conviction has resonated in the global south, where countries struggle to assert their own agendas. Jakkie Cilliers, Head of African Futures and Innovation at the Institute for Security Studies, says there's an understanding that: 'Even though the global south is not united on most matters, its countries do cohere on one - a deepening frustration that the current rules-based system keeps them down and the West on top.'

India's biggest masterstroke was its effort to ensure the AU's inclusion in the G20

India's recognition of this sentiment and the shifting global centre of gravity towards the developing world (evidenced by the recent BRICS+ expansion) has informed its positioning.

African countries have been impressed that India no longer allows the West to dictate its morality. Delhi sent an important message around strategic independence by controlling the narrative around the Ukraine war and pushing back against the 'Western gaze', which sought to impose Western priorities and values on the developing world.

Indeed, in this new multipolar world, India appears to be avoiding great-power competition entirely - instead forging its own, independent path based on its priorities. The pushback resonated with African countries tired of the West's perceived double standards over matters relating to climate, debt, travel bans and the binary framing of the Ukraine war.

India's biggest masterstroke was its effort to ensure the AU's inclusion in the G20. This arduous process required months of canvassing through vehicles like the Voice of Global South Summit (to which all global south countries that weren't G20 members were invited), which India held at the start of its G20 presidency. Its objective was to 'provide a common platform to deliberate on the concerns, interests and priorities that affect the developing countries.'

India garnered huge credibility through these efforts because African leaders felt listened to and represented. As Vera Songwe wrote in the Financial Times, 'India's presidency of the G20 delivered one of the most significant shifts in global governance in a decade: representation for [1.4 billion] people at the world's premier economic co-ordination body.'

Given the political and developmental symmetry between India and many African countries, New Delhi's charm offensive starkly contrasts with the paternalism that the West is often criticised for in dealing with African states.

India's rise as a global power will be inextricably linked to the success of its relationship with Africa

With Africa's strategic importance rising - as countries on the continent emerge as key 'swing states' in the geopolitical tussle - India, with one foot in each of these worlds, has become a trusted interlocutor. And its pragmatic approach is allowing it to reap the rewards.

In addition to diplomatic heft, Delhi can leverage several comparative advantages for its African charm offensive.

For starters, trade. India and Africa command a relatively small share of global trade: 2.8% and 3% for India and Africa respectively. And despite an uptick in recent years, Indian products represent only 6.3% of Africa's total imports compared to China's 18.3%. Creating a free trade agreement therefore seems like an obvious next step.

According to the Financial Times, 'the growth of the next 25 years will be green and it will be digital. And India and Africa, with their increasing incomes and population trends, could be significant markets.' Such a move would also accelerate India's dynamic private sector, which is adept at catering to diverse consumer preferences and delivering customised solutions to large populations.

Next, digital infrastructure. The so-called India Stack - a public digital highway that enables payments and biometric identification - has been a significant success in India. If replicated correctly, it could drastically improve governance, transparency and inclusion across Africa.

India offers a different development model to China - based on inclusion and transparency

Additionally, healthcare. India's role as the 'pharmacy of the world' is well known, and its ability to deliver affordable and scalable solutions across Africa will help tackle a critical priority area for countries on the continent.

Fourth, India's reliance on brown growth means that Africa has a critical role in supporting India's growth story, mainly through clean and renewable energy sources. Africa is a cheap source of fuels and other minerals, and can serve as a 'carbon sink' through offsetting initiatives. Equally, India can provide the investment, infrastructure and technology to maximise brown growth while expediting the green transition.

Finally, India offers a different development model to China - based on inclusion and transparency. China's investment in natural resources and infrastructure, and its military presence, gives it a major influence in Africa. But India's dynamic private sector, focus on technology and pharmaceuticals, soft power approach and clear-eyed diplomatic strategy, offer a compelling counterweight, despite the relatively smaller scale of its activities.

India's rise as a global power will be inextricably linked to the success of its relationship with Africa. India has skilfully recognised the global trust deficit and how it can be leveraged for its own aspirations.

Signs are positive that the India-Africa relationship is shifting from one based on historical factors to one based on contemporary realities. India consistently demonstrates a unique ability to ventilate the aspirations of developing nations on a global stage - but rhetoric must be matched with action. Building influence in Africa won't be easy amid competition from other global powers.

If there is anything we can learn from Kissinger's doctrine and his diplomatic enterprise, it is clear vision and self-assertion.

Notwithstanding Nigeria's tense relationship with Kissinger, or perhaps because of it, there are lessons to be learnt from his career. The very first thing is for Nigeria to recover its self-awareness as a country with the potential, even a manifest destiny, to become a real regional power in Africa, similar to America in the global arena... We could emulate his vision and vigour to pursue Nigeria's manifest destiny in the African and even global context, without necessarily adopting his destructive tactics.

TD 
	

Nigeria should adopt Kissinger's 'great power' vision to assert itself in Africa and the Global South, but not his more devious methods.

As a young, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed idealist weaving my way in the world of liberal academia, I detested Henry Kissinger. The famous man didn't make much of my world - the less developed fringe and the least important in his grand geopolitical model; and I, in turn, didn't think much of him. Even all these years later, it seems I'm no less kindled about Kissinger. So much so that within just a few minutes of hearing about his passing on 29 November 2023, aged 100, I'd penned a pointed poem which I published on WhatsApp, as placeholder for a more elaborate critique.

I felt it was important, even as expected panegyrics had begun to pour in from his admirers, to remind the world what this man had wrought when at the commanding heights of US foreign policymaking. I am glad that in the days since his death, a few obituaries have played to that imperative, without descending into unnecessary obloquy.

There is no question, as almost everyone who knew or read him has acknowledged, that Henry Kissinger was a superior intellect. His record at Harvard University, where he studied and later taught, and his impressive oeuvre on diplomacy, attest strongly to that fact. However, although he did much for the historicisation, theorisation and practice of diplomacy, he also did much that mangled our world. This is something that his establishment biographers and other hagiographers often fail to emphasise, or even mention.

In this piece, I will run through Kissinger's record, but also point out potential lessons for Nigeria's foreign policy, in what has come to be described as the 'Kissinger Doctrine'.

Kissinger was both a master and a relic of realpolitik diplomacy. As many critical experts have argued, he perceived this planet purely as a playground for competing hyper-powers, with America, his America, destined for the dominant position. He was called the 'American Machiavelli' in some circles (others too, including Alexander Hamilton and Donald Trump, have attracted the tag), because he was arguably influenced by the famous Florentine who favoured a ruthless exercise of power, with little concession to morality. Kissinger was also influenced by the wily Anglo-Irish statesman, Viscount Castlereagh, as well as the latter's equally scheming Austrian counterpart, Prince Metternich (his 1954 Harvard doctoral dissertation was a study of these two statesmen). As the seventh US National Security Advisor (1969 to 1975) and 56th Secretary of State (1973 to 1977), Kissinger prosecuted America's hegemonic foreign policy objectives with poise, grit and great skill, but also with utter ruthlessness.

In a terse but well-worded obituary he wrote in 2021 for his fourth successor as Secretary of State, George P. Schultz, Kissinger invoked the Aristotelian concept of phronesis (practical wisdom) and the Hebrew word chokhmah (divine wisdom), both of which he said the deceased possessed. The first of these attributes, which implies wisdom in determining ends and matching them with means, was abundantly displayed in Kissinger's own deportment at the department he headed. It was an attribute which, following Aristotle, Kissinger deemed "indispensable for statesmen." The second attribute, which "stresses the importance of choosing worthy ends," as Kissinger himself described it, was in dubitable evidence: manifest for the major movers he really cared about, but sorely lacking for the less important players in global affairs.

Since the announcement of Kissinger's death, there has been a rehash of the longstanding praise for his foresighted effort in facilitating the US rapprochement with China, his deftness in achieving détente with the old Soviet Union, as well as his creative diplomacy in helping Israel and Egypt reach an accord after the Yom Kippur war of 1973 - one which stabilised the Middle East for a while. These manoeuvres, amongst many others, helped to defuse broader tensions at that phase of the Cold War.

Alongside his many accomplishments, however, Kissinger is criticised for his various other foreign policy postures, in particular his push for America's dastardly bombing of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, and its broader atrocities in the Indochina wars; for his backing of Indonesia's invasion, occupation and genocide in East Timor, the former Portuguese colony which had declared its independence in 1975 but which the Indonesian president, Suharto, still considered a part of his country; and his cynical support of brutal dictatorships in Latin America, particularly in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and elsewhere. This were all part of America's support for the so-called 'Operation Condor', a campaign of political repression and state terrorism that swept the region from 1975 to 1983, ostensibly to stamp out left-wing movements. Also, his betrayal of the Bangladeshi people as they fought for freedom from Pakistan; his betrayal too of the Kurdish peshmerga guerrillas fighting for independence from the Baathist regime in Iraq; his support of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974; and his myriad other moves using Third World countries as pawns in his 'grand design' and aggressive pursuit of America's foreign policy objectives.

The general impression about Kissinger, which is not disputed even by his admirers, is that he cared little for the less privileged geopolitical players in what we now call the Global South. As historian Nancy Mitchell told The Guardian earlier this year, he had "contempt for all developing countries," and was particularly unconcerned about their nationalist or developmental aspirations.

Whether in Southeast Asia, South America, the Indian subcontinent, the Persian Gulf or elsewhere, Henry Kissinger's key concern was to curtail Soviet influence and advance American interest, whatever the cost to the local populations. And the cost was astronomical: in millions of lives lost, in physical destruction of target countries, in economic and political devastation, etc.

One historian, Gary Grandin, chronicling the atrocities committed by America in the Indochina wars, through Kissinger's advice, writes that "the United States dropped 790,000 cluster bombs on (Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam), releasing just under a trillion pieces of shrapnel--either ball bearings or razor-sharp barbed darts" on those countries; that "(m)ore bombs were dropped separately on Cambodia and Laos than combined on Japan and Germany during World War II;" that "U.S. pilots flew, on average, one sortie every eight minutes and dropped a ton of explosives for each and every Laotian, delivering a total of 2.5 million tons in nearly 600,000 runs;" that Agent Orange, the herbicide and defoliant used by the US military as part of its chemical warfare programme in the Indochina wars, hit a third of Cambodia's rubber plantations; and that "there are 80 million unexploded cluster bombs in Laos that are still maiming and killing hundreds of people, often children, every year."

In East Timor, about a quarter of the population was wiped out during Suharto's invasion and occupation of the country, which was perpetrated with US approval, based on the logic of Kissinger's grand strategy.

Though adored by many on the American right and elsewhere, there is, without question, a strong historical case against Henry Kissinger, a case many have made, including the late Christopher Hitchens who scripted the searing polemic, The Trial of Henry Kissinger, later made into a TV documentary in 2002.

This was a man condemned by his own colleagues at Harvard University, led by the Nobel economist Professor Thomas Schelling, for his role in the US bombardment and invasion of Cambodia. These guys gathered up in the spring of 1970 and stormed Washington DC to express their outrage.

Even when Kissinger himself was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, jointly with the Vietnamese diplomat, Le Duc Tho, the latter rejected the award, and some members of the Nobel committee resigned in protest.

Many consider Kissinger a war criminal. The historian, Stephen Rabe, who wrote a book about Kissinger's atrocities in Latin America, told the Associated Press recently that he doesn't "know of any U.S. citizen who is more deplored, more disliked in Latin America than Henry Kissinger."

The general impression about Kissinger, which is not disputed even by his admirers, is that he cared little for the less privileged geopolitical players in what we now call the Global South. As historian Nancy Mitchell told The Guardian earlier this year, he had "contempt for all developing countries," and was particularly unconcerned about their nationalist or developmental aspirations.

If there is anything we can learn from Kissinger's doctrine and his diplomatic enterprise, it is clear vision and self-assertion. We can do it, however, and we can attain real leadership position in Africa and the Global South, without accepting the more destructive legacy left by Henry Kissinger.

We saw that in bold relief in his undisguised contempt for Black Africa. Initially neglecting the continent, when eventually compelled to engage with it, his approach, as The Guardian reported, was "befogged by deception, secrecy and browbeating." His intervention fuelled the war in Angola. In Rhodesia, he only paid lip service to the demand for Black majority rule. He visited South Africa immediately after the 1976 Soweto massacre, the first US Secretary of State to do so in three decades, imparting prestige on the apartheid regime which helped to prolong its life. Elsewhere in Africa, in order to contain the Soviet influence, Kissinger cuddled brutal regimes such as Mobutu's in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Jean-Bédel Bokassa's in the Central African Empire.

Kissinger's realist (read 'amoral') approach to foreign policy was evident too in Nigeria. Long declassified documents show that although he recommended American relief intervention in the Nigerian civil war, especially for the devastated Biafran side, he nonetheless denied that any genocide of the Igbos had taken place. This in part explains America's ambivalence about the war, contrasting sharply, say, with its decisive stance in the 1956 Suez Canal crisis.

There's long been a view, previously expressed and recently revived in TRT Africa, that the February 1976 coup attempt in Nigeria, which claimed the life of General Murtala Mohammed who championed an activist and non-aligned, Africa-centered foreign policy for Nigeria, was backed by the American CIA. It is instructive that the Nigerian government, in April 1976 - just two months after the coup attempt - abruptly cancelled a visit to Nigeria planned as part of Kissinger's 'Africa Shuttle' that year. The ostensible reason was that it was an inconvenient time for Nigeria, coming so soon after the coup attempt. But, as the New York Times speculated at the time, the cancellation came at a time that US-Nigeria relations had become strained, as they supported different factions in the Angolan civil war, among other differences. It was frostiness between a potential regional power that was, at the time, becoming increasingly self-aware and a global superpower aggressively pursuing its self-serving geopolitical interest.

Lessons for Nigeria

Notwithstanding Nigeria's tense relationship with Kissinger, or perhaps because of it, there are lessons to be learnt from his career. The very first thing is for Nigeria to recover its self-awareness as a country with the potential, even a manifest destiny, to become a real regional power in Africa, similar to America in the global arena. There has been, since the 19th century, a notion that America has some "special virtues," a "manifest destiny" (a term coined in 1845 by newspaper editor John O'Sullivan) - or, as some put it, an "irresistible destiny" - to reshape the world. Kissinger believed in the American exceptionalism, and he pursued its ends with "missionary" zeal. We could emulate his vision and vigour to pursue Nigeria's manifest destiny in the African and even global context, without necessarily adopting his destructive tactics.

Today, there's scant perception of any Nigerian manifest destiny because the country is led by largely ill-equipped, poorly educated and unimaginative political Lilliputians. They have wrecked the country and reduced its stature, allowing other regional players to take centre stage. Today, South Africa - a country Nigeria once propped up as its Black population struggled against apartheid - wields a far greater diplomatic clout than Nigeria. Though Nigeria has three-and-a-half times the South African population, and though we claim to be the largest economy in Africa, South Africa operates an annual budget nearly foru times Nigeria's. It was South Africa, not Nigeria, that the newly formed BRIC countries invited in 2010 to join the group. South Africa is the only African member of the G20, not Nigeria, though the African Union has now joined as an institution. And, in the latest edition of the exclusive Lowy Institute's Global Diplomacy Index rating only the top 65 countries in the world, South Africa ranked 26th: Nigeria did not even make the list.

There is no realistic sense in which Nigeria today can claim to be a dominant regional leadership in Africa. Even its dominance of the West African sub-region is in doubt. We have gone from Jaja Wachukwu claiming African leadership for Nigeria in a 1960 House of Representatives speech to foreign policy activism and global confidence under the military, and from there to the current whimper of an inconspicuous Nigeria with a muffled global voice.

If there is anything we can learn from Kissinger's doctrine and his diplomatic enterprise, it is clear vision and self-assertion. We can do it, however, and we can attain real leadership position in Africa and the Global South, without accepting the more destructive legacy left by Henry Kissinger.

HD 	COP28 - Deal to 'Transition Away' From Fossil Fuels Agreed

It was an extraordinary COP Summit in a year characterized by record-breaking temperatures combined with El Niño, producing a climatic carnage in Africa--deaths from fatal floods in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Libya, where floods wiped out a quarter of a city.

Deadly cyclones in Malawi, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe; a severe drought in Kenya, Niger, Somalia, Ethiopia, Mauritania, and Djibouti; and a months-long winter heatwave in southern African countries--the need for COP28 to deliver the highest ambition on all items.

TD 
	

In the end, a deal that will secure the transition away from fossil fuels was accepted.

The United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres, welcomed the deal.

"To those who opposed a clear reference to a phase-out of fossil fuels in the COP28 text, I want to say that a fossil fuel phase-out is inevitable, whether they like it or not. Let's hope it doesn't come too late."

COP28 president Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber said, "Let me sound a word of caution. Any agreement is only as good as its implementation. We are what we do, not what we say. We must turn this agreement into tangible action. If we unite, we can have a profound effect on all of our futures. Inclusivity kept us going in the difficult days. Everyone has been heard, from Indigenous peoples or youth to global south. "

The final stretch of COP28 was dedicated to the most contentious item: fossil fuel, to phase out or cut back. More than 100 countries have pledged to phase out fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.

Fossil fuels--coal, oil, and gas--account for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions, pushing Africa's poor and vulnerable to the brink of survival. The Paris Agreement's global goal of keeping global warming to no more than 1.5°C served as the COP28's compass. To cut greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible by 2050, emissions must decrease by 45 percent by 2030 and reach net zero.

"While this is the first time in the history of COPs that a goal to reduce fossil fuels formed part of the final deal, it is not ambitious enough and will not get us to net zero. We will need a bigger global adaptation fund and a larger Loss and Damage Fund," Amos Kaggwa, a Ugandan-based climate activist, told IPS.

Kaggwa says the planet could reach global average temperatures of up to 3°C, "and there will be even more severe losses and damages from climate-related disasters. Africa's climate-adaptive capacities will also be seriously compromised. Today, high-polluting rich countries are reluctant to pay for loss and damage and to provide sufficient funds for the least polluting poor countries to adapt to climate change."

Thus far, 130 countries have agreed to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030. A total of 2,456 fossil fuel industry lobbyists participated at COP28, up from 636 last year, according to the Big Polluters Out coalition.

Africa emits an estimated 3.8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but only two percent of the proportion of renewable energy investment went to the continent in 2023.

Mary Robinson, Chair of The Elders and former President of Ireland, commented:

"The Cop28 agreement, while signalling the need to bring about the end of the fossil fuel era, falls short by failing to commit to a full fossil fuel phase out. If 1.5C is our 'North Star', and science is our compass, we must swiftly phase out all fossil fuels to chart a course towards a liveable future. World leaders must continue to urgently pull together and find ways forward to tackle this existential threat. Every day of delay condemns millions to an uninhabitable world."

Bavon Christopher, ActionAid Tanzania Country Director, spoke of the landmark delivery of the Loss and Damage Fund at COP28: "On the first day at COP28, we were very pleased with the pledges and thought the money would keep coming. We have USD 700 of the USD 400 billion per year needed to pay for losses and damages. The pledges are far from enough--not even enough for one African country. For instance, a few days ago, floods and landslides killed 60 people in Tanzania, injured more than 100, and destroyed at least 100 homes, not to mention livelihoods."

Experts such as Kaggwa say the COP28 Global Goal on Adaptation did not build on the previous goal, stressing that it is weak and unlikely to deliver adaptive capacities and resilience and to reduce vulnerability to climate change in developing countries battered by climate-induced disasters.

"The Global Goal on Adaptation's weakness is the glaring lack of mention of existing finance gaps. Current financing for adaptation does not match the needs on the ground. Even if we double the adaptation financing outlined in COP26, the needs on the ground will still be five to 10 times greater than the COP28 adaptation fund package. That is how wide the adaptation financing gap is," he emphasizes.

Christopher wades into a conversation that has dominated climate talks among developing nations--climate financing and debt: "An estimated 85 percent of countries in the global South are in debt distress and are unlikely to spend funds on climate solutions due to competing needs. To repay the debts, they are likely to invest in extracting fossil fuels, further exacerbating the climate crisis. Africa should be given grants, not loans or debt swaps. On loss and damage, we expect no bureaucracy, as is often the case with multilateral financial institutions; funds for climate damages should flow to affected countries smoothly and with speed."

Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist based in Nairobi and a senior advisor with Power Shift Africa and also the President of the Global Institute for Sustainable Prosperity, says "climate finance requires a minimum of USD 2.4 trillion of transformative grant-based investment and transfer of technology for climate adaptation and mitigation by 2030. We are nowhere near that target at the end of COP28. The historical polluters of the Global North owe a climate debt to the nations of the Global South, who are most affected by climate change. The Global North is in default and is refusing to pay its debt."

Kaboub, also an Associate Professor of Economics at Denison University, says, "If you owe me USD 100, you are supposed to pay me. Instead, you give me a USD 10 loan with conditionalities to control how I use my money. You give me another USD 10 in exchange for having control over my forests and carbon markets. You invest another USD 10 in green electricity that I must export to you on favorable terms. You outsource another USD 10 worth of low-value-added manufacturing to produce cheap consumer goods for you. None of this should count as climate finance. It is a climate debt default greenwashed with neocolonial debt traps."

Azerbaijan, a nation that receives 60 percent of its government budget from oil and gas and 90 percent of its export revenue, will host the following COP Summit. Oil and gas also supply 98 percent of Azerbaijan's primary energy and at least 90 percent of the country's electricity and are largely responsible for improved living standards over the last three decades. It will be the third time in a row that an oil and gas producer will be hosting a COP Summit.

The Delta State Governor, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori has received the First Climate Change Champion Award.

The award was presented to him by Nurses Across the Borders International at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP 28 Side Event in recognition of his outstanding performance in mitigation of effects of climate change in Delta State and his contributions to the multi-stakeholders partnership initiative for implementation of UNF Triple C Adaptive Strategies.

TD 
	

According to a press release made available to THISDAY, the event which took place on Monday, December 11, 2023, at the Expo City, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, has the theme, ''Building Partnership in Promoting Public Health through Ecological Restoration: What is at Stake''.

Accepting the honour, the highly elated and excited Governor while speaking through the head of the powerful delegation from Delta State, who doubled as the representative of the governor, the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Dr. Kingsley Eze Emu, stated that the theme of the side event: ''Building Partnership in Promoting Public Health through Ecological Restoration: What is at Stake?' was striking and effectual to him personally as a climate change advocate, and to the government of Delta State of Nigeria. ''It will help Delta State to shape and align our Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Roadmap, to cover more facets and frontiers in climate change mitigation and adaptation.''

The governor disclosed his government's activities on climate change since assumption of office ''On assumption of office as the Governor of Delta State on May 29, 2023, my passion for the environmental sustainability made me formulate and drive climate change policies towards mitigation and adaptation as well as just energy transition. As an oil-producing state, we strive to strike a balance between carbon energy phase out and green energy.''

Oborevwori stated that with the collaboration of Delta State Oil Producing Areas Commission (DESOPADEC) as the key driver of his government's energy transition in collaboration with Nurses Across the Borders, the government is developing an energy transition template with the cardinal framework as 'Just carbon energy phase down, phase out' and ushering the new horizon of an Eldorado of green energy sustainable phase in Delta State. ''Our goal is to set a strong sustainable trajectory and roadmap through which the above goals can be achieved.''

He called on the United Nations and world leaders to prioritise climate change adaptation and mitigation for the world to achieve a 1.5-degree centigrade threshold. ''I am not oblivious to the dilemma of COP 28 Transition Committee of LOSS and Damage fund. I note with concerns the debacle, face-offs, debates for and against the administration and operationalization of the fund, the issues of Common but Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR), the World Bank warehouse of the fund, and the politics of global North and South. May I use this opportunity to call on the United Nations and world leaders to prioritise climate change adaptation and mitigation for the world to achieve a 1.5-degree centigrade threshold?''

Oborevwori spoke further on the need to preserve the mother earth ''The earth is the only habitat we have and the only operational existential platform for humanity and other living and non-living things whether global south or north. If we allow climate change catastrophe to destroy the earth and the intergenerational equity of our beautiful children born and unborn in the global South and global North without exception, posterity will not be kind to us.

''It is either we live on the earth by preserving its prosperity for human enjoyment or we die by the earth by deliberately destroying her through climate change naivety and negligence. This would be most disastrous and irresponsible of mankind, that we cannot manage what is freely given to us by nature.

''I call on world leaders to ward off climate change politics or denials and come to terms with climate change justice. The global South is the worst hit of the climate change-induced impacts, yet underdeveloped. There is a great hashtag #Nigeria Climate Emergency, especially in Delta State, as a result. For decades, we have been confronted with drought, flooding, climate change-induced internally displaced persons in various IDP camps due to loss of habitat, food insecurity and health-related issues like pandemics and epidemics.

''Delta State as well as Nigeria is in dire need of Loss and Damage Funding to enable it to ameliorate climate change-induced impacts. Our government through the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, my office and DESPODEC in collaboration with the Climate Change office of Nurses Across the Borders, our climate change consultants, shall after this conference seek modalities through which Delta State can access all climate change funding, benefits, and assistance from the United Nations agencies, partners, World Bank, groups, and donor agencies for the benefit of Delta State people and Nigeria in general.''

Finance ministers of the member states of the Organisation of Southern Cooperation have adopted the bylaws establishing the Common Leveraging Union of Borrowers (CLUB) which is a union of sovereign debtors that aims to pool capacities of member states to reduce external debt burdens.

The union will also help secure more favourable fresh financing that is conducive to transformative, sustainable and multidimensional development through borrower-coordination and collective negotiations with creditors.

TD 
	

The meeting took place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia at the invitation of Secretary-General Manssour Bin Mussallam, in fulfilment of the General Assembly resolution of December 2021.

A joint statement issued by the ministers called for creditors to work together with debtors - in the spirit of equality amongst parties, equity in their relations, and solidarity instead of charity - to achieve an international financial architecture which reflects the perspectives and interests of our countries of the South, serves the human dimension of our development endeavours, and works to the benefit of all parties.

The ministers invited all countries of the Global South to seek membership in the CLUB, and called upon all other international organisations and initiatives - both inter- and non- governmental - to join efforts with, the CLUB as the sovereign debtors' instrument of the Global South, established in the spirit of a mutually beneficial partnership of equals and designed to address the imbalances in the relations and levels of development between the North and the South.

As representatives of member states of the OSC who simultaneously are members of the Group of 77 and of the Non-Aligned Movement - both of which shall be under the chairmanship from January 2024 onwards, of Uganda, a founding state of the OSC - the ministers called the aforementioned groups to engage proactively with the OSC, and, in particular, the CLUB, to achieve our shared aspirations.

The ministers underlined the fact that the OSC's ultimate goal does not run contrary to its standing commitments nor to any particular set of stakeholders, and is entirely directed towards the achievement of authentic development, through strategic investments in sovereignty-enhancing sectors, with an international financial architecture that serves not only our own interests, but also those of the Peoples of the world both in the South and in the North.

The Council of Ministers of Finance will meet regularly to assess developments in the international financial system, determine the direction and course of their efforts, and interact with the Secretary-General of the OSC for the implementation of decisions taken.

The formation of the CLUB further supports the transformative nature of the OSC's third way of development and underscore the need for a sustainable and robust development in the Global South that will not only benefit member states but also contribute to the overall well-being of humanity, fostering opportunities through South-South cooperation, Southern integration, and reducing migratory pressure on the youth in the Global South in the medium to long term.

HD 	Climate Change Risks Triggering a Spike in Infectious Disease Outbreaks - Three Reasons Why

Climate change is our planet's most immediate existential threat, and will likely only worsen for the foreseeable future.

Among its numerous adverse effects on human health, there is strong evidence linking climate change to infectious disease outbreaks.

TD 
	

A recent analysis revealed that of 375 infectious diseases affecting human beings, 218 (58%) can be aggravated by climatic hazards.

It is no longer a question of ''if'', but ''when'' an epidemic will be triggered or amplified by climate events.

It's vital that swift, decisive action is taken to mitigate the impending public health crisis worsened by climate change.

We are part of the Climate Amplified Diseases and Epidemics consortium launched in early 2023. The consortium is made up of leading molecular biologists, epidemiologists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists.

We engaged with hundreds of scientists from around the world to compile a report, the Climate Change and Epidemics 2023 Synthesis, which was launched in Dubai at COP28.

The team members who led the compilation of the report are from the global south. This is important, as the global south is likely to suffer the largest health effects from climate change.

The report identified three main reasons why climate change may aggravate infectious diseases.

*liiitag Increases in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns create conditions for disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, to flourish and expand their distribution ranges.

*liiitag More frequent extreme climatic events such as floods can cause surges of infections, for example by contaminating drinking water with faecal matter.

*liiitag Climate-driven migration by people and their livestock can trigger outbreaks of infectious diseases.

How are diseases linked to climate change?

Rising temperatures may create environments conducive for the spread of certain types of pathogens and their vectors.

For example, rising temperatures may increase the breeding rate of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, and the infectious agents they carry, and expand their distribution ranges to new areas.

Arboviruses, which are transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, chikungunya and dengue now occur in South Asia, South America and Europe in previously unaffected areas.

West Nile virus infections can now be acquired north of the Alps.

The changing climate increases the risk for many types of extreme events such as floods, storms and droughts.

Extreme weather conditions often trigger the displacement of humans and animals, and impair the provision of essential supplies, medical care and transport.

This is particularly true of waterborne pathogens such as cholera. The world is currently in the seventh cholera pandemic.

In 2022 and 2023, following two severe tropical storms causing widespread flooding and destruction, Malawi experienced the deadliest outbreak of cholera in the country's history.

Droughts also cause infection-related problems. People and their livestock may be forced to use unsafe water sources with higher concentrations of contaminants including water-borne pathogens. Hepatitis E outbreaks occur under conditions of water stress.

Lastly, climate change may lead to large-scale displacement and migration of people and animals. The ongoing El Niño phenomenon will likely produce severe drought in some regions of the world, potentially spurring mass temporary and permanent migrations.

This can lead to more and closer interactions with wildlife, which increases the risk of spillover of pathogens, including novel ones.

Looking after the vulnerable

Developing countries are more at risk of climate disasters. They also have less adaptive capacity and preparedness to respond, leaving them highly vulnerable.

We call on governments, academic institutions and health organisations to expand genomic surveillance capabilities for early detection and to monitor the spread of infectious diseases.

Vulnerable communities are disproportionately affected by climate change. These populations should be prioritised by investing in resilient healthcare systems and disaster preparedness measures.

Saying no to 'climate doomism'

Rather than falling for ''climate doomism'', which tends to paralyse rather than trigger action, we prefer to learn from what has been achieved during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These achievements include novel epidemiological and infection control tools, including self-testing or smartphone apps, wastewater epidemiology and genomic sequencing to track the evolution of the agents that cause the disease.

Substantial capacity consisting of skilled people and adequate facilities has been built in much of the global south. This shows what is possible when the world works together.

HD 	''if Not Now, When?'' African Voices On the Final Day of COP28

As COP28 enters, and overshoots, its final deadline, African representatives express both dismay and determination.

The COP28 climate talks are supposed to conclude today, but that seems highly unlikely with key texts still yet to be agreed and controversy raging. Many countries have refused to sign what they see as their own ''death certificate'' due to the watering down of language on phasing out fossil fuels, while oil and gas producers are reportedly seeking further dilution of commitments. A dearth of detail on finance, means of implementation, timelines, clear actions, and other shortcomings have raised concerns of negotiators and civil society from Africa and elsewhere in the Global South that COP28 will leave the 1.5C warming target in tatters.

TD 
	

As activists urge parties to ''hold the line'' on fossil fuels and bleary-eyed delegates go into final deliberations, here are some comments and opinions from African representatives as things stand.

Collins Nzovu, Zambia's environment minister who spoke on behalf of the African Group of Negotiations has said: ''Africa is in support of limiting warming to 1.5C. However, this should be based on differentiated pathways where African countries close the supply gap, rather than developed countries continuing to issue exploration licenses.''

Reiterating his message in an oped for African Arguments, he emphasised the importance of a workable Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). ''We will not agree on anything here unless Africa's top priorities are met, which to us is a GGA framework. If we are serious about saving lives, livelihoods and protecting ecosystems then the GGA framework must have ambitious, time-bound targets with clear means of support for implementation.''

He suggested that, behind closed doors, many countries support Africa's position and said: ''We believe that we will come to an agreement, one that will ensure there is equity, one that will ensure there's a framework where real measurements will be made on progress. I am very optimistic that something will come up...I think we will find common ground.''

Mohamed Adow, director of the think tank Power Shift Africa, has welcomed the fact that the draft text on the Global Stocktake makes the ''first ever mention of fossil fuel production'' in a COP text and that it calls for a reduction in both consumption and production ''in a just, orderly and equitable manner''. However, he notes the huge loophole in its framing as part of ''a jumble of climate solutions which countries 'could' adopt''. That list, he notes, includes real solutions as well as ''dangerous distractions like abatement and nuclear'' along with ''low carbon hydrogen'' which still uses fossil fuels.

Adow questions the looseness of the term ''reducing'' (rather than phasing out) as well as the ''the timeframe of 'around mid-century' and 'around 2050''', which he says are ''not clear enough as a deadline and could push back global timelines to after 2050''. On finance, he notes that there is a ''lack of clear finance and technology transfer commitments by developed countries to give confidence to developing countries that they will get new, adequate, predictable and affordable finance and support to implement the agreed actions''.

Fadhel Kaboub, associate professor of economics at Denison University and president of the Global Institute for Sustainable Prosperity, focuses on the insufficient order of magnitude of finance as we approach the end of COP28. ''Climate finance requires a minimum of $2.4 trillion of transformative grant-based investment and transfer of technology for climate adaptation and mitigation by 2030. We are nowhere near that target at the end of COP28. Climate finance is a climate debt owed by the historic polluters of the Global North to Global South countries that are on the front lines of climate change. The Global North is in default and is refusing to pay its debt.''

Putting aside the wordings in texts, he suggests that the biggest blind spot of COP28 have been some fundamental issues of global governance and the global financial system. ''There is no mention of the World Trade Organization (WTO), no mention of unfair bilateral trade agreements that are unfavourable to the Global South, no mention of reforming the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in the context of transfer of technology for climate action on adaptation and mitigation, no mention of the need to overhaul the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanism or Investment Court System (ICS) through which Global South countries can be sued by foreign investors if the State takes action that interferes with the investor's (extractive) business plans.''

Vanessa Nakate, a Ugandan climate activist, has reflected on the latest text, saying: ''What is happening here is unacceptable. What is happening is unjust. What is happening is unfair, especially for the communities on the front line. If we do not address the root cause of the climate crisis, everything else is pointless.'' She has written in the Guardian: ''Selfish, short-sighted actors are once again sabotaging our collective fate in the name of profit. We know this: last week, Opec sent a letter to its oil-producing member countries asking them to block any progress on fossil fuel phase-out.''

Nakate also emphasises the importance of adaptation and the need for more funding. ''As time runs out in Dubai, it feels as if the lifeboat of our shared humanity is sinking. And fossil fuels are also not the entire story here. The 'home' the majority of us will return to when Cop28 is over is not the home we once felt safe in...At an absolute minimum, developed countries need to double adaptation finance to $40bn per year by 2025.''

Hindou Oumarou, a Chadian activist and COP28 advisor, has said: ''We need strong language about phasing out fossil fuels...We need real action for our people. We want to protect land, we want to protect forests, we want to protect wildlife. If we are not protecting it now, when we will do it?...Our peoples are suffering without access to electricity, water, health.''

Oumarou has also co-written a statement with her fellow UN Secretary-General Sustainable Development Goal Advocates, saying: ''Merely seven years. That's how long we have to fulfil the Sustainable Developments Goals (SDGs) and to halve global greenhouse gas emissions.'' They demand greater and more urgent action but also clear awareness that countries have different capacities to face the impacts of climate change. ''We must resist the false assumption that all countries and people's experiences are the same...We call on the negotiators here in Dubai to address the fundamental drivers of social, environmental and economic injustices that aggravate the climate emergency, and perpetuate the cycle of inequalities between peoples and nations.''

HD 	South Africa's Foreign Policy Under Ramaphosa Has Seen Diplomatic Tools Being Used to Provide Leadership As Global Power Relations Shift

Leadership plays a critical role in diplomacy. What quality of leadership does South Africa need if it's to secure its international interests?

This is a question my colleagues and I have had the opportunity to reflect on in researching and writing about foreign policy since the late 1980s.

TD 
	

Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki displayed assertive African and global south leadership. Their successor, Jacob Zuma, did much to reverse the country's international moral standing.

In our view, the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is restoring the country's standing and role as a global moral leader. He has done so in an environment in which seismic changes are taking place in the balance of power between the world's largest nations.

Ramaphosa's messages, and tone of delivery, suggest an assertive southern leader who understands how the world works. He's not afraid to challenge the dominant narrative and is prepared to put global south demands on the table.

In his speech on Africa Day on 25 May 2023, Ramaphosa said:

We are ... witnessing Africa being dragged into conflicts far beyond our own borders. Some countries, including our own, are being threatened with penalties for pursuing an independent foreign policy and for adopting a position of non-alignment. South Africa has not been and will not be drawn into a contest between global powers. We will maintain our position on the peaceful resolution of conflict wherever those conflicts occur.

In a similar assertive tone, at a Financing for Development Summit in New York in September 2023, he said:

... at a time when solidarity was needed most, agreed international commitments were not honoured. Principles such as common but differentiated responsibilities are not being respected. Four decades since the right to development was established by the United Nations as a human right, the failure to act on commitments to support development is deepening the divide between the global north and south.

These statements reflect Ramaphosa's shrewd reading of a fundamental shift in the global balance of forces. Over the past year it is this that has informed his assertiveness in foreign policy matters. As a result, we argue, he has used the tools of diplomacy to lead Africa and the global south to shape the architecture of a new world order currently being forged.

Facing a complex world

However, Ramaphosa and his administration's ability to advance South Africa's interests globally has became much more complex because of rising geopolitical tensions.

In particular, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 brought into sharp relief the longstanding tense relationship between Russia seeking recognition as a recovering superpower and the west's pursuit of containment.

The conflagration has serious consequences for the world at large, including Africa, already struggling with food and energy insecurities.

Under these conditions, Pretoria struggled to formulate a clear position. It initially condemned the Russian intervention in Ukraine. It later took a more neutral position - ''non-alignment''.

Yet it became clear that Ramaphosa was reading a fundamental shift in the global balance of forces. One of his responses was to call for reform of the UN Security Council.

He also led an eclectic assembly of African leaders on a ''peace mission'' to Ukraine and Russia. It was initially scorned by pro-western commentators. The benefits of the initiative for Africa are becoming apparent, particularly in enhancing food security.

But the turning point in Ramaphosa's increasingly assertive foreign policy conduct came with the hosting of the 15th Brics Summit in South Africa in August. His government succeeded in hosting, chairing and steering the group to new levels of cooperation. Ramaphosa's congenial personality played no small role in the successes.

Achievements include facilitating new trade relations between Africa and Brics, strengthening the New Development Bank, and forging an agreement to expand membership to make Brics more inclusive.

These breakthroughs are not to be underestimated. Reshaping the global order opens the space for an emboldened global south to co-determine the future.

His seeming over-dependence on consultation, seen by many as a liability, stands him in good stead. Because he is comfortable with exercising soft power, he speaks boldly at international meetings. It has also given him the ability to position South Africa prominently, and on the right side of history, on the tragedy in Gaza, seeking peace, not war.

Criticism and scepticism

Some foreign policy practitioners and scholars are sceptical of Ramaphosa as a foreign policy leader. An entire volume of the respectable South African Foreign Policy Review is dedicated to this theme - the decline of South Africa's global moral standing.

Many commentators, including some from the Brenthurst Foundation think-tank, view South African foreign policy through domestic lenses, coloured by their aversion to the African National Congress which Ramaphosa leads and which runs the country.

From this perspective they are quick to denounce South African foreign policy decision-makers as lacking awareness of the objective of international relations and diplomacy. The minister of foreign affairs, Naledi Pandor, in particular, has attracted scorn. In her case, it could be as a result of her outspoken position on the Israel-Palestine conflict.

To understand the tough judgments made of the government's foreign policy it's useful to look at them against the backdrop of domestic politics. Domestic politics and foreign affairs are interwoven. What happens at home affects a country's global standing.

In African foreign policy analytical circles, there is a belief that a weak president embraces international crises as it redirects the attention from failures at home.

Ramaphosa is indeed embattled on the home front. He was meant to put a stop to years of abuse and high corruption under his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, and repair the damage he caused.

Euphoria and unreserved support for a ''reformist'' president turned into disappointment and cynicism as his efforts at ''house cleaning'' got bogged down in the intricacies of power play in the ANC.

Read more: Aziz Pahad: the unassuming South African diplomat who skilfully mediated crises in Africa, and beyond

Nevertheless, we would argue that if Ramaphosa survives the forces of disruption at home as his ruling party decomposes, he will surely be counted among those who read global events, understood that there was a need for a stronger voice from the global south, and acted to make it happen.

He should also be remembered for breathing new life into the vision of the African Union: an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the global arena.

HD 	The EU Protects Its Companies From Big Pharma. South Africa Needs to Do the Same

Critical work being done by local scientists is at risk

Critical work done by South African scientists on mRNA vaccines for several diseases is at risk from patent claims from the pharmaceutical giant Moderna. Yet the government could easily protect this and other programmes by speeding up the passage of amendments to patent laws.

TD 
	

Every year, industry's biggest players spend a combined US$4-billion on legal action. Even then, there was an audible gasp from the world's media when Moderna, which developed a Covid vaccine with the US government, announced it was suing rivals Pfizer and BioNTech for "patent infringement".

All three companies have made a fortune from selling Covid vaccines, and are now at war over the rights to the publicly-funded mRNA technology behind it.

After a year of suing and counter-suing in multiple jurisdictions, the European Patent Office stepped in two weeks ago and revoked one of Moderna's patents covering "respiratory virus vaccines". In doing so, the European Patent Office was seemingly defending BioNTech, a German company, from a "threat".

This is not unusual. In most countries, governments can intervene to protect companies viewed as important to their national interest and can review, revoke, or withdraw patents. Most countries, but not South Africa.

Under Nelson Mandela, South Africa fought Big Pharma to secure affordable generic HIV medicines, and in the pandemic, the government made a valiant attempt to do the same for Covid vaccines by seeking a global waiver of intellectual property rules. But arcane apartheid-era laws still accept patent requests from companies - without substantive examination of the merits of the patent application and without the due process right to challenge it before it is granted. And, once a patent is granted, patient advocacy groups cannot easily revoke it.

There is legislation drafted which could give us the ability to challenge patents before they are granted, among other much needed mechanisms such as compulsory and government-use licensing.

In 2018, Cabinet approved a new Intellectual Property Framework which would give us this most basic right. It is compliant with international trade rules and should not be controversial. But, despite the fact the government has said it wants this legislation, has drafted it, and has even trained examiners on it, the law has sat languishing on the desk of the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel for several years. This has enabled Moderna to be granted far-reaching mRNA related patents in South Africa.

These patents put our widely-acclaimed mRNA vaccine manufacturing project, backed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others, at risk.

While the world quickly developed effective vaccines to combat Covid, intellectual property rules prevented us from making shots for ourselves. Western governments blocked our government's efforts to suspend these global rules, leaving South Africa to wait at the back of the global queue, eventually paying unreasonably high prices for vaccines. Then at the height of our third wave of Covid infections, Johnson & Johnson exported vaccines which had been completed at a factory in the Eastern Cape to Europe, prioritising European customers over South Africa and the continent.

It was a dark time for South Africa. But amid the devastation, some hope came in the form of a small biotech company in Cape Town, Afrigen, when the WHO announced it would be at the centre of a new Global South programme to deliver vaccines.

Sharing technology

Moderna, Pfizer, and BioNTech have all refused to share their technology with the programme. But scientists from Afrigen and universities in South Africa as well as the South African Medical Research Council developed an mRNA vaccine of their own, using the publicly available information from the vaccine which Moderna developed with the US government. They have now begun sharing the technology with partners across the Global South - and are exploring vaccines for diseases such as TB too.

In a future pandemic, the programme could be used to rapidly share vaccine technology between low and middle-income countries, so that we don't repeat the global inequality of the Covid vaccine rollout.

Except that Moderna filed far-reaching patents in South Africa which could be interpreted as covering any mRNA technology. And, under our faulty, unchanged intellectual property regulation system, the patents were granted.

Dozens of health and legal organisations have warned that the mRNA programme is vulnerable to patent claims from Moderna. While the company has given assurances that it will not enforce patents on its Covid vaccine in some lower-income countries, including South Africa, the work of the programme on other diseases remains under threat.

The Medicines Patent Pool, which is implementing the project for the WHO, wants each programme partner (in the Global South) to resolve the issue of patents itself. But, by suing Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna has signalled that it wants a total monopoly on mRNA technology. What, then, is Plan B if Moderna turns on the WHO-backed programme next?

When earlier this year, the Health Justice Initiative took legal action to force the Department of Health to disclose secret contracts with Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers, we won - and the documents revealed that vaccine procurement negotiations were one-sided, with pharmaceutical companies pressuring our government into unfair prices, terms and conditions.

Back to court

Now we are once again preparing to take the government to court to pass key provisions of the Patent Amendment Act. At the very least, we need proper patent examination, ways to oppose patents before and after they have been granted, and easy-to-use compulsory and government-use procedures in place. And we need this quickly.

We have seen how big pharmaceutical companies including Johnson & Johnson use our patent provisions to evergreen patents and then charge the state and sick patients more than they should by holding on to their patent monopolies.

We want to ensure that:

*liiitag monopolies are not granted without examining their merits;

*liiitag the public can exercise its right to oppose a patent before it is granted; and

*liiitag the government can override patents and allow generic production where needed, as do the governments of many other countries.

It is our right in a constitutional democracy.

HD 	Just Transition Q&A - What's At Stake for Africa At COP28?

How can Africa energise when caught in a debt trap? What would a truly just transition look like? What won't be on the table in Dubai?

The climate and energy challenges facing Africa are closely related to but highly distinct from those facing developed countries. Ahead of the international climate talks in Dubai, where we will likely see dozens of positive-sounding announcements, Fadhel Kaboub, an expert in economic sovereignty in the Global South, spoke to our climate editor James Wan about what a truly just transition would look like for a continent that has long been rooted at the bottom of the value chain.

TD 
	

In the run-up to COP28, we will be publishing explainers with experts outlining the issues of importance for African countries in the negotiations. See more here.

As experts explain the need to phase out fossil fuels and ramp up clean energy worldwide, what are the specific energy challenges facing Africa?

Today, about 600 million people in Africa have no access to electricity. And yet, less than 2% of global investments in renewables come to our continent. Moreover, the majority of renewable energy infrastructure on the continent is designed for energy to be exported to Europe. You also have 970 million people (mostly women and children) who are inhaling toxic fumes on a daily basis because of a lack of access to clean cooking technology.

At the same time, we cannot disentangle Africa's fate from the rest of the world's actions on energy. It is due to the historic and ongoing burning of fossil fuels that we are facing this climate crisis, with countries 15 degrees above and below the equator set to face its most intense impacts. We're already seeing droughts, floods, and forest fires across the continent. The World Bank estimates that we will see hotspots of internal climate migration by 2030, with 216 million people globally - 105 million in Africa - forced from their homes by 2050. On the climate clock, 2030 is the day after tomorrow and 2050 is the day after that.

Why is there such extensive energy poverty in Africa?

To understand this, we must look at Africa's place in the global economy more broadly and historically. During colonialism and in the post-colonial period, Africa has played four basic roles: as a place for the industrialised world to get cheap raw materials; as a place for the Global North to sell its industrial output to a large consumer base; as a site for exotic tourism, which is another extractive industry; and as a destination for obsolete technologies like assembly line manufacturing that are no longer needed in the Global North.

We dress up some of these as development and job creation, but they all lock Africa at the bottom of the global value chain. African countries import machinery, fuel, the components to assemble, and even the packaging, and then use their low-cost labour to compete against each other and create a race to the bottom. They import high-value added products and export low-value added ones. Even if you can quadruple your exports, you're still locked at the bottom of the value chain.

If you don't have a long-term strategic vision for yourself, I guarantee you that you're already part of somebody else's. And that's been true of Africa for decades in relation to economic powers like the US, Europe, and China today. All three, with slight variations, see the Global South and Africa in particular through that same colonial lens - as a site for cheap raw materials, a dumping ground, the bottom of the value chain. These outside visions are sadly completely compatible with energy poverty for hundreds of millions of Africans.

According to mainstream models, what is the solution?

Technical advice from the World Bank and IMF focuses on supporting African countries to deal with their debt crises so they don't default, which would lead to more economic problems. That is seen as the priority and the responsible thing to do for African economies. Repaying this debt, which is denominated in foreign currencies, requires generating dollars revenues, and the fastest way to do that is to extract minerals and focus on exports.

The problem is that this is a trap. The more you encourage low value-added exports, the more fuel, components, machinery, packaging, and other inputs you need to import. Tourism as a source of foreign currency reserves is similarly problematic and requires further imports. Decades after the World Bank and IMF have been operating in Africa, we're still in a debt trap. That's either down to incompetence or intentional entrapment.

We can also take a step back and look at the source of the debt, which is structural trade deficits: i.e. the fact that countries import more than they export each year. We have deficits in everything from energy - even Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil exporter, imports nearly 100% of its gasoline - to food, with UNCTAD estimating that Africa imports 85% of its food.

Again, we got here not simply by accident. The continent was the breadbasket of the world during colonial times. This changed after the EU introduced the Common Agricultural Policy in 1962, which used its huge wealth to introduce enormous subsidies to its farmers. The Soviet Union did a similar thing, as did the US, Canada, Japan, Australia. The result is that the Global South could no longer compete on core crops and - encouraged by the World Bank and IMF - started specialising in non-native cash crops for export, requiring more imports of fertilisers, pesticides, and foreign seeds as well as food for domestic consumption.

If the mainstream model is a trap, how can Africa break out of it? What would be a truly effective approach?

We need a just transition, and that means transition from a system that is unjust and has excluded millions of people to one that is inclusive, equitable, and sustainable. Africa's energy challenges are related to health, gender, development, climate and more, and the opportunity to tackle all these problems simultaneously is actually within reach. Africa has an abundance of strategic minerals - that are currently exported in raw form - along with the capabilities needed and a large internal market that can support industrialisation and economies of scale. But to harness this, Africa will need to reject mainstream development models and instead deploy strategic investments in food sovereignty, agroecology, renewable energy infrastructure for its own use, and transformative industrial policies that break from assembly line manufacturing and extractives.

Unfortunately, it is precisely these attempts at decolonising the global economy that have been crushed by the Global North since the 1960s and before. The Bretton Woods financial architecture was established in 1944 when most of Africa was colonised. We are still beholden to a colonial system that is delivering colonial results.

These patterns can take a variety of forms. At COP28, for instance, we will likely see the EU announce a clean cooking plan for Africa. This sounds good but is primarily of benefit to the EU. It is effectively a European industrial policy. It's the EU that will manufacture the clean cooking infrastructure and create millions of jobs for the next 30 years. This output will be deployed in Africa likely via loans as well as some grants and charity. While greenwashed as a positive for a continent, it in fact guarantees that Africa will once again be the consumer of European technology.

What are negotiators likely to be discussing on these issues at COP28. What should Africa advocate for?

These big structural issues are sadly unlikely to be on the table at COP28 but there is still lots at stake for Africa on energy, climate, and just transitions.

The first crucial item is the need to phase out fossil fuels. Recent reports have confirmed yet again that we need to rapidly phase out fossil fuels by 2030. We're currently on track to burn double what we have the carbon budget for and we're putting in new fossil fuel infrastructure to the tune of over $500 billion each year. It's the responsibility of historic polluters to accelerate their phase out first and to finance the transition of developing countries that are locked into a fossil fuel energy system. The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative has been endorsed by hundreds of Nobel laureates, faith groups, scientists, cities, along with eight sovereign countries. African countries should push for it to drive agreement to phase out fossil fuels at COP.

The second critical issue is climate finance. The Loss and Damage fund will be under discussion, and it remains to be decided who will fund it and according to what formula. It ought to be funded by developed countries in line with their historic emissions since the Industrial Revolution. The likes of the US and EU will want to include China as a major polluter, which it is, but it is not a historic one. If you discount the last 20-30 years, China has long been a poor developing country that has only made a dent in terms of climate impact. Moreover, Chinese emissions have not primarily been for consumption in China but the Global North, which outsourced its dirty industries.

Let's recap where we are in terms of climate finance. 15 years ago, rich countries pledged to mobilise $100 billion/year for poor countries. This goal may only be reached this year, and it has mostly taken the form of loans, which contribute to the debt trap. We also have the Green Climate Fund, which has barely raised $12 billion for the entire Global South. And then you have the Loss and Damage Fund, which is currently empty.

These sums are not just puny in comparison to the trillions needed. They are also almost negligible when compared to the estimated $2.2 trillion that moves from poor countries to rich countries each year including in the form of tens of billions of tonnes of raw materials and hundreds of billions of hours of human labour per year. That's why you increasingly see calls from the Global South to transform the global financial architecture, not just improve access to finance or get lower interest rates.

Why won't transformative issues like this be discussed at COP28?

Firstly, because there's resistance from the Global North. Secondly, because we in the Global South still lack a coherent and united front on these issues. They are mentioned here and there but tend to be watered down, for instance in calling for debt to be restructured rather than cancelled or for lower-interest loans rather than climate reparations.

A lot of African countries are so desperate for financial support that they settle for crumbs or false and dangerous solutions like carbon markets. A big bulk of climate finance is in fact going to come from carbon credits, which are essentially pollution permits for polluters in the Global North who are unable or unwilling to decarbonise. Carbon credit schemes don't reduce emissions. They displace communities. They're extractive and mostly benefit middlemen. They see countries giving up territorial sovereignty over huge swathes of land. But if you're desperate because you owe debt that's due in three months, a few million dollars here and there will help. It's a colonial system now being greenwashed a little.

How can Africa escape this situation?

I believe in education in the broadest sense of the term - educating, empowering, mobilising from the bottom up. The good news is that civil society in Africa is clear, focused, and coherent in terms of what needs to be done and some of that is reaching our leaders. As Martin Luther King Jr said of the civil rights movement, we have no time for the tranquillising drugs of gradualism and incrementalism.

We need to change the terms of the debate. This is possible. We were surprised last year, for example, when developing countries putting aside their differences at the last minute in pushing for a loss and damage fund at COP27. We should stop pretending that the Global North doesn't have the resources, the moral and financial responsibility, and the technology to finance that fund with $3-5 trillion. After WW2, the US - still recovering from the Great Depression - gifted the equivalent of 5% of its GDP or about $1.2 trillion in today's money to Germany under the Marshall Plan.

Change is possible, but it will require unity, courage, and solidarity from the Global South, and that will have to come from the bottom up.

The Latin American oil producer shows how true development lies in confronting rather than succumbing to fossil capital.

On 2 December, President Gustavo Petro announced the COP28 climate talks that Colombia would formally join the bloc of nation-states seeking to negotiate a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. Colombia is now the tenth country to call for an international treaty to phase out fossil fuels with a comprehensive just transition framework. It is the first major fossil fuel exporter to endorse the initiative.

TD 
	

This is what President Petro said at COP28 as he announced the decision:

"It is a paradox that, at this table, together with populations that could disappear, there is a country like us, which also depends on oil, and which is committed to endorsing a treaty that implies zero new exploration projects in the world. My own society would say 'how would the President produce such economic suicide?', given that we depend on oil and coal. But this is not economic suicide. We are talking here about an 'omnicide', the risk of extinction of life on the planet.

"Here we are avoiding 'omnicide' on planet Earth. There is no other way, the rest are illusions. There is a very powerful economic power around oil, coal and gas. And they act to prevent changes, to maintain, in a suicidal way, their possibilities for more years of profit in the short-term. Today we face an immense confrontation between fossil capital and human life. And we must choose a side. Any human being knows that we must choose life. I have no doubt which position to take: between fossil capital and life, we choose the side of life."

Colombia now joins Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Niue, Timor-Leste, Antigua and Barbuda, and Palau in calling for a Treaty to phase out fossil fuels, in addition to the European Parliament, World Health Organisation, 101 Nobel laureates, 100 cities and subnational governments, hundreds of scientists, health institutions, faith groups, civil society organisations, and more than half a million individuals.

The latest Production Gap report confirmed once again what the scientific community has been telling us about the importance of phasing out fossil fuels. We are currently on track to extract and burn twice as much fossil fuels in 2030 than what we're allowed to if we're going to meet the climate challenge of keeping global temperature below 1.5 by the end of the century.

Colombia's example to the Global South

Colombia is taking a leadership role that many countries in the Global South can learn from. In a way, Colombia has the same structural deficiencies that challenge most countries in the Global South. Its export revenues mainly come from raw materials, cash crops, and low value-added manufacturing (crude oil 23%, coal 10%, gold 6%, coffee 6%, cut flowers 3%, etc). Meanwhile, its imports tend to be much more diversified, including refined oil products, core crops like corn and wheat, and high value-added manufactured products like industrial machinery, automobiles, and pharmaceutical products.

Like many countries in Africa, Colombia's structural trade deficit puts downward pressure on its exchange rate, which in turn pushes the country into an endless cycle of external borrowing to desperately stabilise its the exchange rate (to avoid imported products bringing inflationary pressures), which accelerates the external debt vicious cycle. Colombia's debt service has routinely hovered around 30% of export revenues.

The dominant narrative being pushed by fossil fuel companies in the Global South is that our countries have a right to develop and have the right to use our natural resources and our territorial sovereignty to do so. They also play the emissions game by persuading our governments that we shouldn't listen to Global North-funded climate activists and that, since we haven't exceeded our carbon budget, we should be allowed to continue fossil fuel extraction. This is a dangerous distraction aimed at securing additional demand for fossil fuels in a world that is set to decarbonise and shift away from dirty energy. It is also designed to lock the Global South into an obsolete, expensive, inefficient, unhealthy, uncompetitive, uneconomical energy system.

It is precisely because Colombia has a right to development that it should choose to diversify its economy and invest in food sovereignty, agroecology, renewable energy sovereignty, and high value added industrial policies.

Demand for Colombian oil and coal is stalling and will decline rapidly in the next couple of decades. What should it do today to avoid a major crisis when its export revenues collapse while its debt service continues to rise? To exercise its right to develop, it should adopt a strategy that reduces its external debt burden, builds resilience, and produces a more sophisticated economic development model that leads to structural transformation.

HD 	Low Emissions and Economic Survival - Countries in the Global South Aren't Getting a Fair Deal

In 2015, more than 140 countries signed up to the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. For countries in the global south this is a huge task. On the one hand they have committed to low emissions. On the other their economic survival depends on using resources that produce high emissions. International economic law scholar Olabisi D. Akinkugbe unpacks the issue of climate justice, and how climate laws and foreign investment laws fit into the picture.

What is climate justice and why is achieving it such a challenge?

TD 
	

Climate change policies are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (which mainly come from the use of fossil fuels) and shift socio-economic activities towards the use of renewable energies. But, unless these changes are made in a manner that considers historical responsibility for the economic imbalances between countries, they risk crippling the economies of the global south.

That's why institutions such as the United Nations Development Programme have called for climate justice, which means:

putting equity and human rights at the core of decision making and action on climate change. The concept has been widely used to refer to the unequal historical responsibility that countries and communities bear in relation to the climate crisis.

A climate justice approach to climate change would consider that developing countries did not contribute to climate change as much as developed countries but bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of climate change.

Yet, as we detail in a recent paper, a combination of legal frameworks for climate change and foreign direct investment is making the situation worse for developing countries. These laws inform the debate on climate change.

What are the laws? How are they flawed?

International climate change law is a layered and complex set of principles, rules, regulations and institutions.

The United Nations climate change regime is at the centre of the international action to address climate change. It does this by addressing mitigation and adaptation challenges. The regime includes the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 2015 Paris Agreement. It also includes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and decisions of bodies like the Conference of Parties to the Convention ("COP") and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement.

The relationship between climate goals and international investment and trade has attracted more attention from scholars since the 2022 report of the Working Group III of the IPCC highlighted the incompatibility of climate goals and trade and investment regimes.

The Paris Agreement is the primary point of intersection between investment law and climate law. Among other goals, the agreement aspires to make finance flows consistent with low emissions pathways and climate resilient development.

In the study I argue that investment law and climate change law are at odds with the quest for climate justice. There are at least four reasons:

First, calls for ambitious and expedited transition to climate-friendly investments leave developing countries at a disadvantage in attracting new investments. Mobilising climate finance for a clean energy transition is expensive. As the finance is also primarily in the form of loans, it deepens the debt vulnerability of developing countries.

Second, treaty-based solutions don't adequately address the power imbalance in the investor-host state relationship. Investment treaties protect investors more than host states. Also, the investor-state dispute system has more consequences for developing countries. And there is disregard for public interest concerns in the award of damages to investors.

Third, embracing market-based solutions led by transnational corporations may reinforce climate injustice while barely reducing emissions. The profit-oriented nature of the investment approach exacerbates the existing debt challenges of developing countries.

Fourth, the risks of investor-state disputes, heavy damages and compensation are generally skewed against developing countries. This affects their capacity to take climate action.

Legal instruments protect foreign investors. The legal protection of foreign direct investment under public international law is guaranteed by international investment agreements and bilateral investment treaties. In addition, multilateral investment treaties, such as the Energy Charter Treaty, and some free trade agreements also protect direct investment.

An investor can sue a host state for violations of treaties or investment agreements and get damages. Developing countries have been on the receiving end of punitive damages. This has led to calls for reform of the arbitration regime that applies to investors and states.

What should be done?

The design of the global transition from fossil fuels to net-zero emissions must account for the economic differences between countries and allow for multiple pathways. This is particularly true for developing countries that must reorganise their economies to attract investments that reduce emissions and generate socioeconomic development, while addressing their debt exposures.

The misalignment of climate change law and international investment law deepens this challenge. This is because many African states depend on the extractive industry to sustain their economies. In addition, the global transition to renewable energy has wider ramifications to produce batteries, electric vehicles, and other renewable energy systems. All require mineral resources from the global south.

Green or climate-friendly investment places global south countries in an unequal position on the international energy chart.

Developing countries, therefore, face the dilemma of balancing fossil fuel extraction with climate-friendly investments. Increased demands for electric vehicles and renewable energy present opportunities for developing states. But many lack the capacity to capture parts of the supply chains of the new green economy.

The transition to net-zero emissions thus poses several problems: climate crisis, extreme poverty, and lack of access to energy.

Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi

Today marks 365 days since India assumed the G20 Presidency. It is a moment to reflect, recommit, and rejuvenate the spirit of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, 'One Earth, One Family, One Future.'

TD 
	

As we undertook this responsibility last year, the global landscape grappled with multifaceted challenges: recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, looming climate threats, financial instability, and debt distress in developing nations, all amid declining multilateralism. In the midst of conflicts and competition, development cooperation suffered, impeding progress.

Assuming the G20 Chair, India sought to offer the world an alternative to status quo, a shift from a GDP-centric to human-centric progress. India aimed to remind the world of what unites us, rather than what divides us. Finally, the global conversation had to evolve - the interests of the few had to give way to the aspirations of the many. This required a fundamental reform of multilateralism as we knew it.

Inclusive, ambitious, action-oriented, and decisive--these four words defined our approach as G20 president, and the New Delhi Leaders' Declaration (NDLD), unanimously adopted by all G20 members, is testimony to our commitment to deliver on these principles.

Inclusivity has been at the heart of our presidency. The inclusion of the African Union (AU) as a permanent member of the G20 integrated 55 African nations into the forum, expanding it to encompass 80% of the global population. This proactive stance has fostered a more comprehensive dialogue on global challenges and opportunities.

The first-of-its-kind 'Voice of the Global South Summit,' convened by India in two editions, heralded a new dawn of multilateralism. India mainstreamed the Global South's concerns in international discourse and has ushered in an era where developing countries take their rightful place in shaping the global narrative.

Inclusivity also infused India's domestic approach to G20, making it a People's Presidency that befits that world's largest democracy. Through "Jan Bhagidari" (people's participation) events, G20 reached 1.4 billion citizens, involving all states and Union Territories (UTs) as partners. And on substantive elements, India ensured that international attention was directed to broader developmental aims, aligning with G20's mandate.\

At the critical midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, India delivered the G20 2023 Action Plan to Accelerate Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), taking a cross-cutting, action-oriented approach to interconnected issues, including health, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability.

A key area driving this progress is robust Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Here, India was decisive in its recommendations, having witnessed the revolutionary impact of digital innovations like Aadhaar, UPI, and Digilocker first-hand. Through G20, we successfully completed the Digital Public Infrastructure Repository, a significant stride in global technological collaboration. This repository, featuring over 50 DPIs from 16 countries, will help the Global South build, adopt, and scale DPI to unlock the power of inclusive growth.

For our One Earth, we introduced ambitious and inclusive aims to create urgent, lasting, and equitable change. The Declaration's 'Green Development Pact' addresses the challenges of choosing between combating hunger and protecting the planet, by outlining a comprehensive roadmap where employment and ecosystems are complementary, consumption is climate conscious, and production is planet-friendly. In tandem, the G20 Declaration calls for an ambitious tripling of global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Coupled with the establishment of the Global Biofuels Alliance and a concerted push for Green Hydrogen, the G20's ambitions to build a cleaner, greener world is undeniable. This has always been India's ethos, and through Lifestyles for Sustainable Development (LiFE), the world can benefit from our age-old sustainable traditions.

Further, the Declaration underscores our commitment to climate justice and equity, urging substantial financial and technological support from the Global North. For the first time, there was a recognition of the quantum jump needed in the magnitude of development financing, moving from billions to trillions of dollars. G20 acknowledged that developing countries require $5.9 trillion to fulfil their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2030.

Given the monumental resources required, G20 emphasised the importance of better, larger, and more effective Multilateral Development Banks. Concurrently, India is taking a leading role in UN reforms, especially in the restructuring of principal organs like the UN Security Council, that will ensure a more equitable global order.

Gender equality took centre stage in the Declaration, culminating in the formation of a dedicated Working Group on the Empowerment of Women next year. India's Women's Reservation Bill 2023, reserving one-third of India's Parliament and state legislative assembly seats for women epitomizes our commitment to women-led development.

The New Delhi Declaration embodies a renewed spirit of collaboration across these key priorities, focusing on policy coherence, reliable trade, and ambitious climate action. It is a matter of pride that during our Presidency, G20 achieved 87 outcomes and 118 adopted documents, a marked rise from the past.

During our G20 Presidency, India led deliberations on geopolitical issues and their impact on economic growth and development. Terrorism and the senseless killing of civilians is unacceptable, and we must address it with a policy of zero-tolerance. We must embody humanitarianism over hostility and reiterate that this is not an era of war.

I am delighted that during our Presidency India achieved the extraordinary: it revitalised multilateralism, amplified the voice of the Global South, championed development, and fought for the empowerment of women, everywhere.

As we hand over the G20 Presidency to Brazil, we do so with the conviction that our collective steps for people, planet, peace, and prosperity, will resonate for years to come.

The Women's Climate Assembly brought together movements from across Africa and came up with a powerful declaration.

TD 
	

The climate talks at COP28 in Dubai this November-December will once again be dominated by rich governments, multinational corporations, and elites pushing their greenwashing "solutions" and lobbying for their vested interests. The annual climate summit, presided over this year by an oil executive, has become a co-opted space by groups that continue to plunder communities' minerals and natural resources for profit, forgoing their historical responsibility and wreaking climate havoc as the world around us burns. Literally. Communities from developing countries across the globe have no relief from this rampant extraction nor are their voices for real climate justice being heard.

2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record and nowhere is the outlook bleaker than in Africa, which is experiencing increasing climate disasters. From severe droughts in the Horn of Africa, sea level rises which have engulfed whole villages across West Africa, to cyclones in southern Africa, the signs of the growing climate crisis are here.

Our continent is on the frontlines of climate and ecological breakdown, with African women feeling the impacts most acutely given their ties to nature as peasant farmers and their "traditional" caregiving roles. When water sources are depleted or contaminated, it is women who spend up to eight hours per day fetching potable water to sustain their families, at great personal risk. When erratic weather and rain patterns disrupt planting seasons and worsen food insecurity, it is African women farmers, who make up at least 60% of the food producers on the continent, that feel it the most.

COP28 should be an opportunity to address these challenges, which have been caused by the Global North's relentless thirst for minerals, timber, coal, oil, and gas. Africa has only contributed 4% of climate emissions. But unfortunately, developed countries have shown little willingness to confront these problems of their own making and their roots.

Instead, countries in the Global North continue their scramble for African resources - some of them now to power energy transitions - bringing with them a blight of human rights violations, corruption, conflict and wars, and environmental collapse. The massive fuel lobby continues to shape international commitments, for example in watering down the language on coal from "phasing out" to "phasing down" as gas extraction expands in Africa and across the Global South. And we see a major push to propose false solutions such as carbon markets, which transfer responsibility of containing and reducing emissions to the Global South rather than at source in the Global North or industrial powerhouses such as China and India.

The Women's Climate Assembly

To provide an alternative forum and bring the voices of African women to the fore, the second Women's Climate Assembly (WCA) was held from 24-28 September in Lagos, Nigeria. Led by a steering group of women's movements, grassroots networks, and a few NGOs working in solidarity with women in resistance, it gathered 200 women from across West, Central, East, and Southern Africa. The delegates, representing 70 communities and organisations from 17 countries, are at the forefront of resistance against large development projects that extract and exploit Africa's natural resource wealth at the expense of people and the planet.

The WCA was one of many Peoples' Assemblies convened as part of the third African People's Counter COP (APCC), a hybrid event hosted by the African Climate Justice Collective (ACJC), which advances a progressive flank of a continent-wide climate justice movement. At its heart, the APCC was a response to failed COP negotiations, the lack of political will by countries most responsible for the climate crisis, and the erasure of those most impacted by multiple ecological, geopolitical, and socioeconomic crises.

As WoMin Francophone Coordinator, Oumou Koulibaly said: "We are asking them to change the system. We cannot live in this climate...With the Counter COP, we will make COP28 into a space that serves us. A space where we can put our demands forward and ensure that the voices of communities are front and centre."

The declaration

Through a process of consultation within their home countries leading up to and during the WCA, the women participants clarified and consolidated their demands in the form of a powerful declaration. This collective document outlines many ills that the communities and organisations represented say a firm "NO" to. Among many other items, this includes the "exclusion of Africa women", "false promises and lies", "threats and the use of force", and "green projects which lead to our forests being fenced, our land being taken, and our lives destroyed so that companies can go on polluting while we suffer more."

At the same time, the declaration says "YES" to many solutions.

For instance, it calls for corporations to pay "for the damage they do to our environment, our health and well-being", highlighting that "rich countries have long benefited from stolen land, labour, and knowledge". At COP28, this principle will be tested in discussions around the Loss and Damage Fund, announced at COP27. This fund is meant to address the irreversible harm experienced by frontline communities due to climate breakdown, but many organisations are concerned at how it is being operationalised. IBON International has warned that framework that has arisen through the past year of negotiation ignores "historic responsibility [and] principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities". The recommendation of the World Bank as interim host of the fund meanwhile has raised fears that the Loss and Damage Fund will be treated "as a bank rather than as a mechanism for justice" in the words of Trusha Reddy, Energy and Climate Justice Coordinator, WoMin. "We fear that this will be another weak and empty fund like the Green Climate Fund."

The WCA declaration also outlines demands and propositions such as "respect for the principles of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) always, and the right of communities to say NO to projects which do not meet their needs". The Right to Say NO is a growing campaign across the continent as communities rise to claim their consent rights against corporations.

The declaration also says YES to, "development which respects and protects all living beings, from the smallest ant to the elephant and all species in between. We know that humans cannot live without nature, and we demand that any development holds the same respect and care."

For COP28 to deliver real climate justice to millions of people across the Global South, the voices of Africa and African women must be heard. Movement-centred platforms like the Women's Climate Assembly are vital contributions to cultivating the radical, fair, and just climate action we need now.

Climate change has been a source of concern among the international community since the 1970s. Yet, almost fifty years since the issue was first raised in international diplomatic circles by prominent scientists, the situation continues to deteriorate, with rises in temperatures and extreme weather causing ever-magnifying problems around the world.

What has the global community done to date to deal with what many consider an existential threat to humanity's future? And what needs to happen next in the UN negotiations as diplomats and other key stakeholders head to Dubai for COP28? This briefing provides a short history of global cooperation to date, then looks towards Dubai and beyond for what needs to happen next.

COP28 is being held against a complicated global backdrop. With conflict and turmoil in Europe and the Middle East, tension among the great powers and economic uncertainty around the world, how realistic can our ambitions be for COP28 and what does it need to deliver for us to consider it a success?

We argue that, although much more has been done to date than many give the UN and global community credit for, we face a critical time where action needs to be scaled-up dramatically if we are to avoid the worst outcomes from the climate threat.

A Brief History of the International Community's Response to Climate Change

The United Nations first began to set out the case for action on climate change in the late 1970s, with the First World Climate Conference in 1979. Sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), it brought together scientists from various disciplines to explore the issue.

This led in 1988 to the establishment by the WMO and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which took scientific consideration of climate change to a new level. The research-based warnings presented by the IPCC strengthened the case for action (and continue to do so today).

Initially, a Second World Climate Conference was held in 1990 and this set the agenda for negotiations on a global treaty. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was agreed by the UN General Assembly in time for the June 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The agreement entered into force in March 1994 when 50 countries had ratified the convention through their legislatures. It now has 198 Parties.

The UNFCCC is sometimes criticized for being weak or ineffective. However, as a "framework" convention, it should really be considered a foundation or starting-point for further agreements that build upon it. In this respect, it models earlier agreements, including the ones that have so successfully tackled the ozone crisis.

The Vienna Convention, which was the first treaty on ozone, was itself quite limited. However, subsequent agreements, including the Montreal Protocol, built a strong and ultimately successful structure upon this early foundation.

Furthermore, the UNFCCC does include some strong and important concepts and commitments, including the need to limit climate change caused by humans to a level that is not dangerous. It also recognizes that some countries are better placed than others to do this work, and that many, such as those in the Global South, will need support and assistance.

The UNFCCC led rapidly to the Kyoto Protocol, which was agreed in December 1997. It, too, recognized the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" between different groups of countries, with developed countries to take the lead and carry the most responsibility for emissions in the atmosphere.

The Kyoto Protocol was innovative in several ways.

First, it included specific targets for many countries from the Global North. While not all governments took these as seriously as they might, in many countries it started an ongoing and detailed policy response from governments, including greater investment in renewable energy and other policy shifts to begin to decouple economic growth from the growth in fossil fuel emissions.

These efforts have enjoyed some success, and per capita emissions have dropped in many industrialized countries even as rising populations and economic growth elsewhere mean global emissions have continued to increase overall.

What's more, the Kyoto Protocol provided a catalyst for private sector engagement. Government policies that encouraged corporate investment in new technologies, emissions trading, and other innovations began to make the climate response look more like a "whole-of-society" effort than one involving sequestered government departments.

However, as the economies of the Global South grew and prospered in the 2000s, it was clear that Kyoto, with its focus squarely on actions in the Global North, would not be enough.

Hopes were high that the Copenhagen Climate Conference in 2009 would replace the Kyoto Protocol with a more ambitious approach that would come into effect from 2012.

Ultimately, it failed in its immediate goal of securing a new, legally binding agreement. However, as we note in our book, Heroes of Environmental Diplomacy (Routledge, 2022), although the meeting did not secure a new deal, President Obama did manage to float some new concepts in a weakened outcome known as the Copenhagen Accord. The ideas it contained included a $100 billion climate fund to help the Global South and, even more significantly, a need for all countries to be a part of the solution to climate change.

In 2015, the seeds sown at the disappointing meeting in Copenhagen finally bore fruit. The Paris Agreement took on the ambitious aim of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. It requires countries to take on targets and to report back to the UN on progress.

While some criticized these targets for being voluntary rather than mandatory (as was the case with Kyoto), many praised the fact that the commitments were to be taken on by all countries. What's more, the Paris Agreement provided flexibility so countries could take on what was best fitted to their particular circumstances and level of economic development. This made it possible for all countries to agree on the way forward, since it continued to respect nations' sovereignty rather than trying to impose specific emissions targets on them.

One sign that Paris has had a positive impact has been forecasts for future global temperature rise by the end of the century. Before 2015, various predictions based on emissions trends suggested rises of upwards of 4, 5, and 6 Celsius, or even higher.

This would be utterly catastrophic for humanity. Today, forecasts trend somewhere between 1.8C-3C, depending on the assumptions in the model. To be clear, these are still very bleak numbers. They signify likely outcomes that are highly dangerous and may even be calamitous. But it does show an encouraging trend.

The next significant UN climate conference was COP26 in Glasgow. Held in 2021 as the world was still reeling from the COVID pandemic, the outcome from COP26 included the Glasgow Climate Pact, which sought to promote the reduced use of coal and other sources of emissions.

Glasgow also witnessed the first review of countries' voluntary commitments under Paris (known in UN-speak as "Nationally Determined Contributions"). Glasgow also promoted the idea of 'coalitions of the willing' to advance ideas that might not have enough support to find consensus among all 198 countries that belonged to the UNFCCC, but that were nevertheless considered by some to be worth pursuing.

In spite of some skepticism at the time, some of these coalitions do promise positive results. For instance, the Methane Pledge now has 111 countries committing to a 30% reduction in methane on 2020 levels by 2030. If countries honor their promises, this could bring down climate projections by 0.2C by 2050.

Another coalition of the willing was the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which brought commitments from over 650 global financial institutions from banking, asset owners and managers, insurers and financial service providers committing to support the transition to net zero. Again, promises only matter if they are kept. However, if they are honored, then the impact of GFANZ will be significant.

In 2022, the UN Climate Conference, COP27, was held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. There, the major breakthrough was the agreement on the need for a fund to help developing countries suffering loss and damage caused by climate change. Such a fund has long been a rallying cry for negotiators from the Global South, as well as their allies.

What Next? Looking towards COP28 in Dubai

COP28 is being held against a complicated global backdrop. With conflict and turmoil in Europe and the Middle East, tension among the great powers and economic uncertainty around the world, how realistic can our ambitions be for COP28 and what does it need to deliver for us to consider it a success?

Progress on Loss and Damage

The run-up to COP28 in Dubai has seen significant work by a transitional committee deliberating on the infrastructure of a future Loss and Damage Fund. It was meant to have three meetings between the COPs and ultimately needed more before a compromise was found on where such a fund might be situated. In the end, the agreement was for the World Bank to act as an "interim" host for four years.

The decision to set up a similar governance structure to the Green Climate Fund has perhaps given it a heavy bureaucracy, which might be a problem in the future. However, the forward momentum and growing certainty on how it will be organized has encouraged a number of countries to put funds into the nascent Loss and Damage Fund. This includes the European Union, which is pledging "substantial" contributions. Meanwhile, the host country, UAE, is looking at making a contribution, The US has also said it would put "several millions into the fund". While modest in size, it is at least a start.

A key issue in Dubai will be who will get the money. The agreement at COP27 was to assist "developing nations, especially those that are particularly vulnerable".

The EU is suggesting this means the least developed countries and small island developing states. Developing countries have so far resisted reducing it to those groups. Some point to situations such as the terrible floods in Pakistan before COP27 as an example of how funds might be allocated. Pakistan is neither a least developed country nor an island state. Does that mean it would not have been eligible had such a fund existed at the time, in spite of its clear and obvious need?

In spite of these kind of uncertainties, COP28 is expected to advance work on the Loss and Damage Fund. Failure to do so would be judged harshly, given recent momentum.

Beyond Loss and Damage - Boosting Funding

The commitment proposed back in Copenhagen in 2009 for US$100 billion a year for climate finance by 2020 was not achieved until 2022. In part, the blame for this can be placed on COVID 19, which caused disruption in aid and climate budgets, among many other problems.

While the $100 billion goal has now been attained, it is important to remember that this was intended as a floor and not a ceiling. Furthermore, much of the money is being distributed as loans rather than grants. As a consequence, it has actually had a negative impact on the indebtedness of some least developed countries.

The reality is that we need trillions, not billions, to address climate change and that government aid will not be enough. As a reference point, Official Development Assistance (ODA) reached a new high of US$204 billion in 2022. While welcome, this is wholly inadequate for the climate crisis, for which funding should be additional to ODA in any case.

COP28 marks a staging post on the path to developing a new collective quantified goal on climate finance, which is slated to be agreed in 2024. In Dubai there will be a High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on 3 December. This discussion should send a strong signal that any new goal in 2024 will be ambitious, innovative, and at a much higher level than in the past. Anything less will invite criticisms that COP28 was a missed opportunity.

Looking Back to Leap Forward?

A major component of the talks at COP28 will be what insiders call the "global stocktake". Held every five years, it presents delegates with an opportunity to assess their collective progress in delivering on the Paris Agreement. How has the world performed in terms of climate mitigation, adaptation, and implementation?

Participants in this year's stocktake have before them the worrying fact that the world is already nudging close to the 1.5C warming limit governments pledged to stay within. Optimists are hoping COP28 catalyzes the beginning of more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions in the next two years, and a strong collective undertaking by governments to redouble their efforts.

The signs so far are not positive. Since COP27, only 20 countries have increased their pledges, including Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.

While this should be welcomed, none of the major emitters has stepped forward. Recently, the head of the UN's climate office, Simon Stiell, labeled efforts as "baby steps" rather than the "bold strides" that are needed. If COP28 does not yield a satisfactory outcome on this topic, many are likely to see it as a missed opportunity, or even as a failure. At the very least, major emitters should step up at COP28 and indicate that they will be announcing much more ambitious goals sooner than later.

A Host of Problems?

In recent months, there has been considerable criticism of the incoming UAE Presidency. Many media commentators have asked why an OPEC member should be hosting a climate COP? Does this not send a bad signal, they ask?

Many of these talking heads may not be aware that UN Climate Summits are rotated around the five UN regions, and that this was Asia's turn to host. Furthermore, there was little appetite from other governments in the region to host it.

Critics have also pointed out that the President of COP28 will be Sultan Al Jaber, who has a history in the fossil-fuel industry. The counter-argument is that he has also been prominent in promoting the UAE's work on renewable energy. He was the founding CEO and is the current Chair of Masdar, a UAE-owned renewable energy company. As we write this article, the United Arab Emirates has launched the Al Dhafra solar farm. It is now the world's largest single-site solar farm, powering 200,000 homes.

Rather than engaging in these debates, we would argue that the host government should be judged on whether COP28 is a success. The UAE Presidency has identified its own priorities where they will push for major progress: mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, innovating the UN process by engaging more with the private sector, and pushing for greater inclusion, accountability and transparency.

These are worthy goals and it should therefore be possible to judge them based on these topics once the meeting ends. If they deliver, it will show that a fossil fuel producer is capable of promoting progress on climate change. If it does not, then the UAE will certainly come in for criticism.

It is also worth noting that, although the UAE is a prominent fossil fuel producer, many previous hosts have also been in the same camp, even if some are less well known for this. For instance, Poland, South Africa, India, and Indonesia have all hosted COPs in the past (Poland has actually hosted three), and yet all four of these countries line up among the world's top ten coal producing countries.

Meanwhile, Qatar, another former host, is a major oil and gas producer. Should they not have hosted the COPs? Again, we feel hosts should be judged by the results they achieve.

Ramping Up the Carbon Market

The Paris Agreement included use of carbon markets to reach our emissions targets. A rulebook for this was largely completed at Glasgow in 2021. This should open the door to many billions of dollars of investments (in 2021 it was $2 billion). The rules set at Glasgow should help ensure that offsets are of high "quality" (meaning they genuinely help reduce and offset emissions).

COP28 will provide an opportunity to assess early progress as we move into an implementation phase. Are the markets ramping up? Who is using them, and how can we encourage them to grow? COP28 needs to address these issues.

Global Goal on Adaptation

The world is so far down the climate change path that adapting to its impact is already happening and will be unavoidable in future. A review under what is known as the Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work programme (GlaSS) will be presented at COP28, and clear targets, indicators, and financing options are expected by COP29.

There was also a commitment in Glasgow to double adaptation funding by 2025. If this happened, it would raise the amount to US$40 billion annually. Again, COP28 provides an opportunity to give some early signals this goal will be achieved.

Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero

Outside the government negotiations, observers at COP28 will also be looking for progress by other stakeholders. For instance, the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero referred to earlier represents two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130 trillion, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals, including limiting global warming to 1.5C. The potential of such a group is enormous.

At COP28, this group should report back on progress, and other stakeholders should be ready to hold it to account to ensure these goals are real and are being actively pursued, rather than just being empty promises.

Judging Dubai

COP28 has a number of key outcomes it needs to deliver, as well as being an important stepping stone to further COPs that will also have to deliver specific outcomes that are ambitious and commensurate with the scale of the challenge we face.

If delegates in Dubai are to declare success, they will need to finalize the Loss and Damage Fund, advance the Goal Global on Adaptation, and pack a real punch with the Global Stocktake, with concrete outcomes to help us limit global temperature rise. Do this, and COP28 stands a good chance of being hailed a success. Fail to deliver and observers will view it rightly as a missed opportunity not just for diplomacy, but in guiding us towards a more sustainable future.

A panel of African climate experts identify the continent's key priorities at the UAE climate talks.

From 30 November to 12 December, an estimated 70,000 delegates will descend on Dubai for the UN's annual Climate Change Conference. Almost every country in the world will participate in negotiations over how to address the climate crisis, limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, and support vulnerable communities to adapt.

TD 
	

As ever, the agenda at COP28 will be jam-packed. Issues up for discussion will include the Loss and Damage Fund, climate finance for developing countries, the phaseout of fossil fuels, plans to accelerate just energy transitions, the Global Goal on Adaptation, and much more. This year's talks will also see the first Global Stocktake of how much progress (or lack thereof) countries are making in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.

What does Africa, a continent disproportionately affected by the impacts of the climate crisis, need most from these negotiations? We asked a diverse panel of African experts what the continent's priority should be at COP28.

Mohamed Adow: Get lifesaving climate funding flowing, not just for emissions reduction and loss and damage but adaptation

They say money makes the world go round and, for Africa, the issue of money at COP28 will determine whether Africans will be able to respond to the climate crisis.

Rich, high emitting countries in the Global North promised to deliver a paltry $100 billion in climate finance by 2020, but that deadline was missed. We need COP28 to be the place where we start to see the money flowing to African communities who are on the front line of climate breakdown.

Rich countries try to ignore an important aspect of climate funding: helping the vulnerable adapt to the impacts of climate change. This adaptation finance is vital for Africa and needs to be given much more prominence. We need to see African leaders working together, with other Global South leaders, to ensure climate finance is split 50/50 between adaptation and emissions reduction.

The other money matter is a separate fund for loss and damage. This new fund was agreed last year at COP27 and is designed to compensate for the loss and damage caused by climate change. Getting the fund agreed in Egypt was a major victory but we need to see money flowing into this fund if it's going to reach those that need it. We need to see rich countries coming forward with commitments to the loss and damage fund.

If we can get this lifesaving climate finance flowing in Dubai it will be a big win for Africa and the world's climate vulnerable.

Joseph Nganga: Africa will contribute its vast resources to addressing climate change but needs something in return

We are in a climate crisis that has largely been caused by more industrialised economies, but the most impacted people are the people whose infrastructure is still in development. Africa, a region with a developing economy endowed with abundant natural resources, stands at a crossroads where strategic financial investments can steer its trajectory towards a prosperous climate resilient future.

The narrative from the inaugural Africa Climate Summit (ACS) and its resulting Nairobi declaration, which has resonated well globally, positioned Africa not as a victim of climate impact but rather a key player in the global climate narrative willing to contribute its vast resources to drive climate-positive growth. In exchange, the world must commit to the right type of financial resources at the right scale as well as innovative technologies to help unlock the raw potential the continent has. This will not only mitigate environmental risks but also stimulate economic growth and create employment opportunities.

The world requires a new quantum of capital to meet its climate challenge, which must be governed by its climate priorities and not by shareholding interests. The investments must be driven by the impact on climate and not by underlying economic factors. This requires a collaborative approach from governments, private sectors, and international entities as demonstrated at the ACS. The global community must take their commitments and pledges and turn them into real outcomes to drive climate positive growth on the continent while unlocking solutions for the world.

Lorraine Chiponda: COP must agree the phase out fossil fuels, justly

At the Africa Climate Summit, leaders reaffirmed an ambitious target of increasing renewable energy's installed capacity from 56GW to 300 GW by 2030. This was motivated by both climate action and alleviating energy poverty. However, this is not enough to fight the global climate emergency. As scientists have repeatedly found, this will require the fast and fair global phase out of fossil fuels. At COP27, we heard justifications for the dash for gas in Africa under the false premise that it will bring prosperity for the continent. Yet the dash for gas has been for export and external consumption. It undermines Africa's climate action and will leave the continent with stranded assets as the world transitions towards clean alternatives.

Finance and technology are part of the key levers that can facilitate a fossil fuel phase out. However, justice - as well as feminism and decoloniality - should be at the core of the transition. As we heard towards COP28, countries in Africa and the Global South should demand a just transition that requires historic polluters to pay reparations. As it stands, Africa receives a meagre 3% of the total global climate finance and African countries still play a marginal role in the global finance system, making it a mammoth task to obtain funds for renewable energy investment. Rich polluting nations should also be challenged to rapidly reduce their emissions to a real zero and reduce levels of consumption so we avoid further devastation of the environment and the imminent climate catastrophe that Africa is already experiencing.

COP28 should not be another show of global leaders sipping coffee but provide real solutions that address communities already living through the crisis. False solutions that give polluters the license to pollute whilst placing the burden on Global South countries to sequestrate the carbon produced by rich nations should be placed in the dustbins of history. They are colonial and do not mitigate the climate crisis. COP28 discussions should transform our relationship with nature and with each other from a system that is exploitative, destructive, and extractive to one that centres care and interconnectedness.

Grace Mbungu: Africa needs adaptation solutions based on what people really need

The stakes for current and future generations are too high. Africa needs serious and sustained climate adaptation action. But first, the world needs to get out of the thinking that there are quick and easy fixes. We have dug too deep. Climate change is affecting every aspect of life. In Africa, the climate crisis is entangled in social and economic underdevelopment, inequalities, and an energy poverty crisis.

To address these challenges and improve the realities of Africans, adaptation solutions proposed at COP28 must move closer to the people and address what they need, want, and value. That means adopting adaptation policies and implementation strategies that address climate change impacts and vulnerabilities, while at the same time providing sustained and secure livelihood opportunities and wellbeing conditions, for current and future generations.

To this end, the locally-led adaptation (LLA) approach provides an important opportunity. These examples show that communities are leveraging local and indigenous knowledge and resources to implement innovative solutions to climate change impacts. The aggregate of these context-specific solutions can result in collective, effective, and sustained climate action. The LLA approach could also provide entry points and ownership for other climate actions, such as mitigation.

At COP28, delegates must explore how to document, measure, scale, and harness support for local adaptation solutions and strategies. This requires tapping into and providing significant investments that prioritise strategies, initiatives, and practices that are rooted in local and indigenous knowledge.

Olivia Rumble: Climate finance is again a rightful priority

As has been the case for many years, climate finance will remain a rightful priority for most, if not all, African delegations at COP28. African countries are working hard to change global perceptions about investment risk, while also pushing for fundamental changes to the global financial architecture more broadly, and championing the implementation of the Paris Agreement's finance provisions.

This year at the African Climate Summit, countries were united in their call for a series of finance reforms that would have a meaningful impact on their fiscal and policy space to address climate change. These include a reduction in borrowing costs and risk premiums; debt management, restructuring and relief; scaling concessional climate finance from multilateral developments banks (MDBs); and reforms to the global tax regime. While these proposals can be progressed in various multilateral fora, COP28 and its global stocktake present an opportune moment to capture and respond to the scope and depth of these reforms and configure how they might be implemented.

African countries will also have their eye on a new target for the provision of climate finance post-2025. They will want the target to be informed by actual needs and available science, and plotted against a burden sharing agreement, instead of whatever developed countries elect to pledge. To build trust, developed countries will also need to make good on their promise to double adaptation finance by 2025. Following the climate finance findings of the latest UNEP Gap Report, which was subtitled "Underfinanced. Underprepared", the sentiment around this issue is likely to start off poor.

Elizabeth Wathuti: COP must help Africa's young leaders realise their vision

COP28 has a clear agenda: urgent climate action, global cooperation, and inclusive solutions. For Africa, these priorities are not just talking points but the pathways to our future. Africa stands resolute, knowing that COP28 is pivotal in our fight against climate change. We recognise that climate action isn't a choice but necessary for our survival and prosperity.

At the heart of Africa's vision stand Africa's young leaders and young minds who envision a world where clean air, thriving ecosystems, and economic prosperity are within reach. The success of COP28 is pivotal to realising their dreams and aspirations.

Our continent has vast renewable energy resources, sustainable agriculture, and resilient communities. COP28 is an opportunity for Africa to shine, seeking support for green investments, empowering our youth, and championing climate justice.

Together, we can chart a formidable path toward a sustainable, equitable, and promising future for Africa and the world, where climate action is not just a promise but a forceful reality that benefits all.

Saliem Fakir: Concerns of the Global South must be not only heard but addressed

This year, COP negotiations must engage in candid discussions, acknowledging historical responsibilities concerning emissions and climate finance. The Negotiated Outcome and Action Agenda of the Global Stocktake must meticulously identify the implementation gap, directly linked to the climate finance deficit, and formulate solutions that refrain from unfairly burdening African nations with mitigation efforts. The concerns of the Global South must be not only heard but actively addressed.

Africa has highlighted its fervent commitment to achieving a robust global mitigation outcome, steering towards a 1.5 degree future. The continent's aspirations include widespread energy access, harnessing renewable energy potential, and substantial investments in related infrastructure and grids. Beyond endorsing one of COP28's proposed goals - tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 - African nations boldly declared their intent to increase it six-fold within the same timeframe. This, however, necessitates policy autonomy and finance that doesn't exacerbate existing debt burdens.

Africa seeks measures facilitating the primary processing of raw materials on the continent, aligning with dual climate and development objectives. Essential to this vision is securing adequate, predictable and purposeful finance. With that, Africa calls for integrated support packages, such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships, to expand into sectors beyond energy.

COP28 must allow frank discussion about unilateral trade measures, particularly the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is well overdue. This should not be a side note but a focal point in discussions on response measures permeating multiple work steams.

Lastly, the issue of loss and damage requires decisive action for Africa. COP28 should build on the recommendations of the Loss and Damage Transitional Committee, sharing a purpose-fit fund. Crucially, the existing text should incorporate firm obligations on African countries to contribute quantified and time-bound commitments. COP28 must serve as a pivotal platform for catalysing finance pledges to operationalise this fund.

President William Ruto has urged nations in the Global South to unite in addressing issues affecting the world.

He said the Global South must take advantage of the democratic character of multilateralism to push for meaningful changes.

TD 
	

President Ruto noted that it is time these nations stepped forward to safeguard their collective interests.

He cited fiscal measures taken by powerful economies, supply chain disruptions on account of conflicts, high-interest rates driving nations

in debt distress as some of the main global issues affecting those in the Global South.

"These conditions have created an environment where millions of people are poor and unemployed, struggling against a global order that appears rigged against their aspirations," he said.

He made the remarks on Friday during the second Voice of Global South Summit, which was conducted virtually.

The Head of State emphasised that collaborative efforts will empower the Global South to expedite its economic growth.

This, he explained, will transform it into the driving force of the next phase of the Industrial Revolution.

"The overdue economic renaissance of the Global South is held off by systematic marginalisation and exclusion from multilateral discourse in terms of effective participation and benefits," he added.

President Ruto told the Heads of State and Governments at the Summit to use the upcoming COP28 to push for global climate action.

"It can no longer be business as usual when the people of the Global South are unfairly punished by extreme climate for the economic sins of others," he added.

ADDIS ABABA-Through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China presupposed that common growth and sustainable development of the Global South would be possible via paving ways for cooperation and championing the world economy, an expert said.

Many scholars expressed conviction that the initiative has now been instrumental in connecting the Asia, Europe and African continents through land, air and sea infrastructure. The scheme is also said to connect the Global South via trade, investment, tourism and other related sectors.

TD 
	

Approached by the Ethiopian Press (EPA), Dilla University Economics Assistant Prof. Dawit Hayeso (PhD) noted that the BRI, which has been operational for the last 10 years, is bearing fruits in bolstering the socio-economic and political relations of the Global South. The initiative is also of paramount significance for African countries.

"For instance, if we consider the case of Ethiopia, the initiative is behind the construction of the railway line that connects Addis Ababa with Djibouti ports. The railway line is instrumental to avoid the sluggish pace of transporting commodities using trucks."

Laid on the principle of mutual growth, the BRI has greatly helped Africa and enshrine concrete changes in all aspects in the continent over the last 10 years, Dawit added.

It is to be recalled that over 10,000 representatives drawn from 151 countries and over 41 international organizations participated in the BRI forum that was held recently in connection with the 10th anniversary of the scheme.

Opening the conference, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the initiative has been stretched from Asian to Africa and Latin America as over 150 countries and over 30 international organizations signed the cooperation framework. In addition, more than 20 special multilateral cooperation forums have been set up under the program.

Under the auspices of the initiative, world countries made the pledge to open economic corridors, international transport, roads, railways, airports, ports, tunnels and power generations.

According to the economist, the West's criticism of the initiative emanated from their sheer interest to solely exploit Africa's raw materials and supply their industries. "As the BRI is based on cooperation and mutual benefit, some West countries see it as a threat to their greedy interest to exploit the Global South's raw materials."

The BRI was framed based on the 'silk road,' which had been connecting Asia, Middle East, Africa and Europe in trade for 2000 years, it was learned.

HD 	A Call to Reframe the Inequitable Global Poverty Definition

When some people living in the Global North hear of the poverty level of less than $2 per day by the United Nations and extreme poverty line of $2.15 per day as defined by the World Bank, they wonder how people survive on such amounts. This is understandable if one views poverty through the lens of the Global North. However, this is far-removed from reality. The one-size-fits-all approach to measuring poverty fails to account for contextual variations in the cost of living (including housing, food, healthcare, and education) across countries and regions, and could be a significant factor  hindering the effectiveness of global anti-poverty initiatives. 

TD 
	

In this article, we would explore the contextual variations of three crucial socioeconomic factors commonly used for poverty comparative measurements - food, rent, and education. We would build on these to make a compelling case for reframing how we define and address poverty especially at this critical moment after the 2023 UN General Assembly where world leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to end global poverty. We would mainly use Nigeria and the United States where both authors have lived for our comparative analysis.

Food is a fundamental concern when discussing poverty. The UN and World Bank definitions do not adequately account for the vast differences in food prices around the world. Evidence shows that restaurant and groceries prices in major Nigerian cities are about 77.7% and 66.9% lower than in the U.S respectively. So, while $2 - 2.15 per person per day is grossly insufficient for daily sustenance in a country like the U.S, it can provide balanced diet in many Global South countries.

An American TikTok tourist, Chris - Authentic Traveling (@authentic_traveling) made a video on what a $1 equivalent of the Nigerian currency (naira) can fetch you in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria. This included a sausage roll, a plate of rice, boiled brown beans, spaghetti, egg, cow skin and tomato stew; African pear and corn-on-the-cob, a 35cl bottle of coca cola coke, 2 pieces of stewed pork, and puff-puff (puffloafs). In contrast, $1 can only buy you a can of Coca Cola in the U.S.

Lagos is one of Africa's top megacities , and has a mix of rural, urban-slums, and metropolitan areas. It is noteworthy that in the rural communities, people find innovative ways to maximize their limited resources by harnessing alternatives such as subsistent agriculture (including planting crops, fishing, and animal rearing) as their main/preferred livelihood and direct foodstuff supply source. That way, there is little need for actual monetary purchase of food.

One of the most glaring disparities in the cost of living between Global North and Global South countries  is  housing cost. In major U.S cities, apartment rent is exorbitant, often consuming a significant proportion of a person's income. Average rent price in major Nigerian cities is about 64.2% lower than in the U.S, with a one-bedroom apartment annual rent of about $578.56  per month in the city center. The average monthly rent for a similar apartment in major U.S cities cost $1,852.21.

Education is another critical dimension where the context of poverty is apparent. Education costs in low income countries is significantly lower than in high-income countries, with their governments offering either free or highly subsidized fees depending on the education level. The issue of inadequate infrastructure and poorly paid teachers may be raised. However, one should not  consider the quality of the curriculum and graduates subpar, as there are numerous track records of youths from developing countries competing favorably with their counterparts from developed nations in international examinations, competitions, and academics.

To further highlight the significant contrast in poverty definitions between developed and developing countries, we reviewed  the 2023 U.S Federal poverty guidelines   released by the Department of Health and Human Services. The guidelines state that in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, an individual living alone with an annual income below $14,580, and a family of four with a $30,000 annual income live in poverty, and are eligible for government assistance programs.

Let's juxtapose these figures with the living costs in a developing country like Nigeria, where the World Bank's 'extreme' poverty line is $2.15 per person per day, translating to roughly $782.75 annually. It becomes evident that a person considered poor in the U.S, could be considered middle-class or even affluent in a developing country.

We acknowledge that redefining poverty based on contextual variations in living costs is not straightforward. One might highlight that the availability of safety nets such as tuition and mortgage loans in high-income countries (which is very limited in developing nations) buffers the high living costs. However, these structures leave people in high-income countries perpetually in huge debts averaging $59,580, on student loans, mortgages, autoloans, and credit card - a situation most people in developing countries cannot relate to since they mostly live debt-free.

Furthermore, critics may also argue that such definition shift would not only complicate poverty measurements, but dilute the global poverty fight or lead to relativism, where poverty is perceived differently based on location. However, it is crucial to emphasize that the redefinition does not mean abandoning efforts to combat poverty. Instead, it calls for a more context-conscious approach that better embraces the diverse socioeconomic realities of our world so that more effective and targeted solutions can be birthed to alleviate poverty on a global scale.

Simply put, redefining poverty in both Global North and Global South would help with poverty eradication efforts and it is the equitable thing to do.

HD 	Entrepreneur Turns Waste into Opportunity, One 'Briquette' at a Time #AfricaClimateHope

Isaac Ndyamuhaki, a young Ugandan entrepreneur with a background in forestry, is passionate about using solutions to help communities become more resilient to shocks like poverty and the global climate crisis. He is the founder and team leader of Asili Kwanza Uganda, a social enterprise that provides safe, affordable, and sustainable energy solutions.

TD 
	

Ndyamuhaki comes from a country where agriculture is highly practiced and large amounts of waste is generated. The majority of the population in Uganda depends on biomass-based fuels, such as charcoal and firewood, which are disastrous for the environment because they require cutting down trees and reducing forest cover. These biomass-based fuels are associated with indoor air pollution due to cooking fires and are responsible for hundreds of deaths.

In response to these problems, Ndyamuhaki founded Asili Kwanza Uganda to convert agricultural waste into briquettes, a smokeless, less expensive, and more sustainable fuel. His social enterprise has served around 400-450 households to date, saving them from indoor pollution and reducing waste dumping in Kampala. Asili Kwanza won the top finalist prize at the Africa Climate Innovation Challenge 2023 for its campaign for safe, affordable, and sustainable cooking solutions.

Ndyamuhaki was motivated to start Asili Kwanza after seeing the negative impacts of agricultural waste disposal in his community. "I looked around and thought, 'Hey, this agricultural waste that is generated is mostly burned or dumped in landfills, which further releases emissions and contributes to the deterioration of the environment. But it could be harnessed into something better," he said.

"Briquettes are easy to make, even with simple locally fabricated machines. The key is to know how to mix the waste materials (raw materials) in the right proportions to ensure a good quality output," Ndyamuhaki said. "Briquettes are a promising alternative to traditional cooking fuels, but their quality and performance can vary depending on the mix of waste materials used."

Reflecting on Asili Kwanza's impact, he said the organisation is proud of its work in the past two and a half years to reduce indoor pollution, save trees, and create jobs in Uganda.

"We're working with informal waste collectors to provide them with jobs," he said. "They're the ones who provide us with the raw materials for our briquettes. We have 12 full-time young employees working in administration, production, and marketing, and another 18 people working indirectly ... such as transporters, commission agents, suppliers of raw materials, and waste pickers. In total, we have around 450 beneficiaries of our work, and we hope to scale that up even more".

We've also recycled 80,000 tons of waste in Kampala, which helps to reduce waste dumping in the city. It may not seem like a lot, but we think it's quite important. And it also means that we're saving trees from being cut down to satisfy the demand for charcoal and firewood, and contributing to overall climate crisis solutions

In addition to discussing Asili Kwanza's impact, Ndyamuhaki also talked about the challenges the organisation faces, such as educating the public about the benefits of briquettes, increasing demand for the product, and securing funding to scale-up operations. He said that Asili Kwanza is still operating on a micro-scale and is unable to address bigger markets due to its limited capacity of three tons per month, but demand is almost triple.

"Another challenge is the changing dynamics of government policies regulating business operations through taxation and other regulations. This makes it difficult for the organisation to operate as efficiently as it could," he said. "Funding is also a major challenge... With additional funding, Asili Kwanza could scale up its production and meet the demand for its briquettes. Another challenge is accessing financing schemes, as financial institutions often have stringent restrictions for startups."

Ndyamuhaki said their company's motto is "conserve and sustain". He also talked about the three flagship products that have helped them to achieve this goal. "We produce more than just briquettes. We also make multi-purpose solar-aided improved stoves with solar panels, fans, and batteries. These stoves burn biomass more efficiently and faster, and can also provide additional energy for lighting and charging phones."

"Only 45% of Uganda has electricity coverage, so many people are left behind. Our solar dryers for post-harvest handling can help. About 99% of Ugandans still dry their crops on the ground, which leads to spoilage and aflatoxin contamination," he said. "In 2021, Kenya refused to import Ugandan maize because of aflatoxin contamination ... a global problem, but it is most prevalent in developing countries where agricultural practices and food storage conditions are less than ideal. Our solar dryers can help farmers produce clean, safe food. We also have solar dryers for other crops, such as cassava and bananas."

Briquettes are a more affordable and sustainable cooking fuel than traditional options

Briquettes are a major advantage for many Ugandans because they are more cost-effective than other cooking fuels and burn cleaner.

"Before I started using briquettes, I used to spend more money on charcoal, and my house would fill with unpleasant fumes while cooking," said Grace Nakatudde, a Ugandan resident. "But after switching to briquettes, I spend less money on cooking and my kitchen no longer fills with fumes. I spend less money on cooking, going from 5,000 Ugandan shillings (about 1.30 USD) to 2,000 Ugandan shillings (about 0.52 USD) per day. Thanks to Asili Kwanza for providing such a great product."

Nakatudde is among hundreds of families in Uganda who use briquettes as a cooking fuel source.

Wood fuels: Necessary, but at what cost?

Wood fuels are the most widely used source of energy for cooking in sub-Saharan Africa, with over 90% of the population relying on firewood or charcoal. Charcoal is mostly used in urban areas, while firewood is the predominant form of wood fuel used in rural areas, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Wood fuels are essential, but their use has significant environmental and health costs.

Clean cooking is a major global challenge, with over 3 billion people relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking and heating. This indoor air pollution kills an estimated 4.1 million people each year, including 3.2 million from exposure to soot and smoke from traditional wood-burning cookstoves, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Some governments have tried to persuade their citizens to use other fuels, such as liquefied natural gas and electricity because wood burning is seen as outdated and environmentally unfriendly. However, many people cannot afford to use cleaner alternatives and spend long hours each day searching for fuel wood, or resort to collecting and using various forms of biomass, such as grass, shrubs, sawdust, wood chips, trimmings, twigs, animal dung, crop residue, and related plant materials.

The burden of this health crisis falls disproportionately on women and children, as they spend more time in close proximity to the smoke from traditional cooking methods, reports WHO.

Women's role in clean cooking

Women bear the brunt of traditional cooking methods, says clean energy expert Ifeoma Malo. Malo is the Chief Executive at Clean Technology Hub, a pioneering hybrid hub for the research, development, demonstration, and incubation of clean energy ideas, technologies, and resources for clean energy organisations and environment and climate-friendly initiatives across Africa.

Women face grave health risks due to the smoke and residue from their open fire stoves as well as their daily struggles to find enough wood. "While women take up the majority of the burden of cooking activities globally, the heavier risks and costs are largely borne by lower-income countries," she said. "These risks are not just physical and medical (such as the health risks associated with smoke inhalation from cooking with kerosene or firewood); they also bear the risk of traveling far distances to fetch firewood, as well as the risks of sexual harassment."

Malo added that clean cooking access can help mitigate the burden of domestic chores for women and give them more time for other activities. "Thus, if we want to improve clean cooking, women must play a significant role and receive special attention, even as advocates for clean cooking," she said.

"Women are essential to expanding access to clean cooking because they are the primary users and decision-makers, and because clean cooking can improve their health, well-being, and economic opportunities," she said. "Sustainable development and the enhancement of the lives of millions of people worldwide depend on involving and empowering women in clean cooking projects."

Benefits and drawbacks of using briquettes as a clean cooking source

Briquettes are a clean cooking source that offers a number of benefits, said Malo. Briquettes produce fewer emissions and contribute less to indoor air pollution, which can lead to better health outcomes. Briquettes are also more efficient, meaning that they require less fuel and produce more heat for cooking. This can save time and money, and reduce the need for fuel collection, which is often a burden on women and girls. It can help to reduce deforestation by lowering the demand for firewood and charcoal and can be made from agricultural waste and crop byproducts. This can provide an extra source of income for rural communities.

Ndyamuhaki the benefits of clean cooking for women, especially for housewives in Uganda. "Clean cooking solutions protect housewives from the harmful fumes emitted by traditional cooking methods. These fumes can cause respiratory problems, hair loss, and other health problems," he said.

"Women can also save money on cooking fuel. Ugandan housewives typically receive a daily allowance from their husbands, known as Kameeza money, which means 'table money.' This money is usually a subsistence allowance left by husbands in the morning before they go to work. This money is used to cover the cost of basic household expenses. Since housewives do not have a source of income, saving money on cooking fuel is a significant benefit. Asili Kwanza also employs some women as salespeople, providing them with an additional source of income."

Despite the many advantages of briquettes as a clean cooking source, there are also some drawbacks to consider, said Malo. "Briquette production can be labour-intensive and requires specialised tools that may not be easily accessible in some locations. Briquette production requires infrastructure and machinery setup, which can be expensive and burdensome for some people and communities. Depending on the ingredients and manufacturing processes, briquette quality can differ. Lower-grade briquettes may burn inefficiently and emit more smoke. Briquettes are also less available than conventional fuels on the market, and access to them can be restricted in some areas. Briquettes must be carefully transported and stored, just like other types of fuel. In some instances, storage space or shipping expenses may be an obstacle."

"It can be difficult to persuade people to transition from conventional fuels to briquettes. Cooking habits can be strongly influenced by cultural preferences and behaviours," she added. Despite these drawbacks, briquettes remain a promising clean cooking solution with the potential to improve the health, well-being, and economic opportunities of millions of people around the world.

Future of Clean Cooking in the Global South

In order to make rapid progress towards clean cooking, various enabling factors must be addressed, including raising awareness about traditional cooking methods' environmental and health impacts, providing access to clean and affordable cooking technologies, ensuring capacity building and financial support for the development of sustainable fuel supply chains, and providing access to affordable and clean cooking technologies.

Ndyamuhaki envisions a bright future for clean cooking in the global South. He says that "despite the challenges, the future of clean cooking in the global South is bright, thanks to the growing number of initiatives in this space. For example, we are not only looking at improved biomass fuel manufacturing but also at innovative solutions such as solar-aided stoves and affordable low-cost clean cooking technologies. Additionally, there are many other players involved in the clean cooking sector, which validates my statement that the future is bright. Finally, people are increasingly adopting clean cooking technologies because they are tired of traditional cooking methods and the associated health and environmental problems."

Ndyamuhaki believes carbon credits could help with costs for users. It can play a significant role in the future of clean cooking by helping companies to lower the cost of their products for consumers, making them more affordable.

At the Africa Climate Summit, clean cooking was highlighted as a priority climate solution for a sustainable future in Africa

Ndyamuhaki says "I see carbon finance as a very promising avenue for achieving universal access to clean cooking by 2030. It can help business players subsidise clean cooking technologies, making them more affordable for grassroots people. For example, a carbon offset project or agent could give 80% of the cost of an improved stove, leaving the final user to pay just 20%. This would make these solutions much more scalable on the ground. I see carbon finance as a good way to scale up clean cooking and other climate-related solutions for grassroots people, because I've seen it work with others."

The African Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) was launched at the United Nations Climate Conference (COP27). It promised to unlock billions in climate finance for Africa, but climate activists warn that it is a dangerous distraction from reducing emissions at the source. A new report, Africa Carbon Markets Initiative: A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, by climate think tank Power Shift Africa and partners details the dangers of carbon credits and why African leaders must avoid falling into the trap of adopting them. The report shows that the ACMI is riddled with deficiencies and inconsistencies, and will only fling open the floodgates of pollution.

World needs global pledge on renewables, energy efficiency

In Sub-Saharan Africa, over 600 million people lack access to electricity, and almost a billion do not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. Africa has the largest gap in clean cooking access, and its clean cooking plans often lack resources. At present, less than a third of these plans are funded, and the COVID-19 pandemic and high fuel prices have led to a reduction in incentives and financial support for households, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

However, Africa can overcome its energy challenges and provide reliable, cost-effective energy access to all by 2030 by harnessing its abundant renewable resources, including abundant sunlight and strong winds.

Ndyamuhaki spoke about the partnerships he has established in Africa to expand his clean cooking mission.

"I have established several partnerships in Uganda, given the scale at which I am currently operating. My partners are mainly business development partners, such as Challenges Uganda, an arm of Challenges Worldwide. They are supporting me with business strategising. I also have a partnership with Masrcorp company, which manufactures improved stoves specifically designed for briquettes. We have a business-to-business collaboration where they sell my products to their clients.

"I have also established a partnership with Green Africa Youth Organisation (GAYO), which is supporting me with linkages to potential funders and investing in business modeling and strategising on how to tackle the problem of waste. GAYO has established a zero-waste project in Kampala .. and have waste pickers who are related to my business for taking of the waste recycling."

"The uptake of clean technology will transform the energy landscape by reducing reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating climate change, and promoting sustainable development," said energy expert Malo. "Clean technologies adoption can lead to a more environmentally friendly energy system with significant benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating the transition to renewable energy, improving air quality, enhancing energy independence, and creating job opportunities. It also drives technological advancements, promotes energy efficiency, increases resilience to climate change, and stimulates economic growth," she added. "However, these benefits require addressing infrastructure, regulatory, and financial challenges through collaborative efforts from governments, businesses, and communities."

Africa's green future - Jobs, sustainability, and transition

"Young people can position themselves for green jobs by training and retooling themselves in relevant skills. This could include learning how to recycle, make improved stoves, or other green technologies. The green economy is a broad field, so young people should be flexible and open to new opportunities," Ndyamuhaki said.

"The potential for green jobs is significant, as more and more companies are adopting sustainability practices and incorporating green manufacturing into their operations. If everyone continues to adopt sustainability principles, the potential for green jobs is vast. African governments need to establish solid structures and working policies to achieve a green economy. If you look at different countries in Africa at the moment, there are many examples of where these structures and policies are lacking".

For example, in Uganda, there is a problem with people encroaching on natural resources, even though there are laws in place prohibiting this. This is because the government is unable to enforce these laws. This is a problem because the problems we have in Africa stem from structures and policies that do not work."

"Without working structures and policies, it will be difficult to regenerate industries, encourage cooperation on green economy initiatives, and invest in the technology needed to usher in a green economy," said Ndyamuhaki. "This includes investing in technology, such as digital payments, to reduce the use of paper and other resources."

He urged African governments to invest in transitions to clean energy and sustainable manufacturing. This would help to create jobs and boost economic growth, while also protecting the environment. "The most effective way to use green energy is to be sustainable at your own level," added Ndyamuhaki. "This means using energy wisely and efficiently, regardless of the source. We also need to incorporate green energy into manufacturing to reduce the amount of energy needed to produce goods."

Make-or-Break Issues at COP28

As the 28th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) climate summit approaches, African countries are hoping to advance their climate agendas and advocate for more global action.

The upcoming summit is generating excitement for a groundbreaking event: the first Global Stocktake, a critical component of the Paris Agreement. The Global Stocktake is a two-year process that happens every five years and assesses the global response to the climate crisis. This is an opportunity for countries to agree on concrete milestones toward achieving their 2030 targets, including climate adaptation, finance, and technology.

For Africa, this process is critical as the continent only contributes about 4% to global greenhouse gas emissions but is disproportionately affected by the climate crisis, with increased droughts, floods, and other weather-related disasters, impacting food security and socio-economic development. The Global Stocktake is an opportunity to ensure that the international community lives up to its commitments and that climate action reflects the deep transformations needed across all sectors to build a resilient future for Africa and the world. At COP28, countries must commit to using the stocktake's findings to keep the 1.5°C goal alive and address the impacts of the climate crisis.

COP27, also known as the "Africa COP," was held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, and resulted in a significant milestone - the agreement on a loss and damage fund.  However, many issues remain unresolved. At COP28, African delegates are expected to focus on loss and damage, climate finance, and energy transitions. They will urge other countries to adopt ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, renewable energy, and low-carbon technologies, and cooperate more closely with developing nations by providing financial and technological assistance. Last but not least, they will advocate for climate justice and equity, arguing that developed countries should take the lead in mitigating the climate crisis and supporting vulnerable communities.

As for Ndyamuhaki, he wants to see more investment in climate solutions that reach the people who need them most.

Hopes for the future of climate action in Africa

Ndyamuhaki said that his hope for the future is that young people see themselves as solution providers to the climate crisis. He envisions himself as a leader and a practitioner in providing real solutions and alternatives to help everyone make a small contribution towards solving the climate crisis.

He believes that climate activism is important, but that it is not enough to simply tell people what not to do. We need to offer solutions and alternatives. For example, instead of telling people to stop using plastic bags, we need to provide them with affordable and accessible alternatives.

Ndyamuhaki wants to be the person who says: 'Don't cut down trees. Use briquettes for cooking. Use an improved stove. Use this instead of that, and I have justifiable reasons for what I'm saying.'

"I encourage young people and others to take it upon themselves to be solution creators and value creators. This is what we stand for as young people, and it is what we need to do to rebuild ourselves and the communities we serve. Many portray Africans as poor people, but we need to change the narrative and address that problem. While we are fighting climate change, we can also look at it as a precursor for providing solutions to poverty," he said.

Isaac Ndyamuhahi, a young Ugandan entrepreneur with a background in forestry, is passionate about using nature-b ased solutions to help communities become more resilient to shocks like poverty and the global climate crisis. He is the founder and team leader of Asili Kwanzaa Uganda, a social enterprise that provides safe, affordable, and sustainable energy solutions.

TD 
	

Ndyamuhahi comes from a country where agriculture is highly practiced and large amounts of waste is generated. The majority of the population in Uganda depends on biomass-based fuels, such as charcoal and firewood, which are disastrous for the environment because they require cutting down trees and reducing forest cover. These biomass-based fuels are associated with indoor air pollution due to cooking fires and are responsible for hundreds of deaths.

In response to these problems, Ndyamuhahi founded Asili Kwanzaa Uganda to convert agricultural waste into briquettes, a smokeless, less expensive, and more sustainable fuel. His social enterprise has served around 400-450 households to date, saving them from indoor pollution and reducing waste dumping in Kampala. Asili Kwanzaa won the top finalist prize at the Africa Climate Innovation Challenge 2023 for its campaign for safe, affordable, and sustainable cooking solutions.

Ndyamuhahi was motivated to start Asili Kwanzaa after seeing the negative impacts of agricultural waste disposal in his community. "I looked around and thought, 'Hey, this agricultural waste that is generated is mostly burned or dumped in landfills, which further releases emissions and contributes to the deterioration of the environment. But it could be harnessed into something better," he said.

"Briquettes are easy to make, even with simple locally fabricated machines. The key is to know how to mix the waste materials (raw materials) in the right proportions to ensure a good quality output," Ndyamuhahi said. "Briquettes are a promising alternative to traditional cooking fuels, but their quality and performance can vary depending on the mix of waste materials used."

Reflecting on Asili Kwanzaa's impact, he said the organisation is proud of its work in the past two and a half years to reduce indoor pollution, save trees, and create jobs in Uganda.

"We're working with informal waste collectors to provide them with jobs," he said. "They're the ones who provide us with the raw materials for our briquettes. We have 12 full-time young employees working in administration, production, and marketing, and another 18 people working indirectly ... such as transporters, commission agents, suppliers of raw materials, and waste pickers. In total, we have around 450 beneficiaries of our work, and we hope to scale that up even more".

We've also recycled 80 tons of waste in Kampala, which helps to reduce waste dumping in the city. It may not seem like a lot, but we think it's quite important. And it also means that we're saving trees from being cut down to satisfy the demand for charcoal and firewood, and contributing to overall climate crisis solutions

In addition to discussing Asili Kwanzaa's impact, Ndyamuhahi also talked about the challenges the organisation faces, such as educating the public about the benefits of briquettes, increasing demand for the product, and securing funding to scale-up operations. He said that Asili Kwanzaa is still operating on a micro-scale and is unable to address bigger markets due to its limited capacity of three tons per month, but demand is almost triple.

"Another challenge is the changing dynamics of government policies regulating business operations through taxation and other regulations. This makes it difficult for the organisation to operate as efficiently as it could," he said. "Funding is also a major challenge... With additional funding, Asili Kwanzaa could scale up its production and meet the demand for its briquettes. Another challenge is accessing financing schemes, as financial institutions often have stringent restrictions for startups."

Ndyamuhahi said their company's motto is "conserve and sustain". He also talked about the three flagship products that have helped them to achieve this goal. "We produce more than just briquettes. We also make multi-purpose solar-aided improved stoves with solar panels, fans, and batteries. These stoves burn biomass more efficiently and faster, and can also provide additional energy for lighting and charging phones."

"Only 45% of Uganda has electricity coverage, so many people are left behind. Our solar dryers for post-harvest handling can help. About 99% of Ugandans still dry their crops on the ground, which leads to spoilage and aflatoxin contamination," he said. "In 2021, Kenya refused to import Ugandan maize because of aflatoxin contamination ... a global problem, but it is most prevalent in developing countries where agricultural practices and food storage conditions are less than ideal. Our solar dryers can help farmers produce clean, safe food. We also have solar dryers for other crops, such as cassava and bananas."

Briquettes are a more affordable and sustainable cooking fuel than traditional options

Briquettes are a major advantage for many Ugandans because they are more cost-effective than other cooking fuels and burn cleaner.

"Before I started using briquettes, I used to spend more money on charcoal, and my house would fill with unpleasant fumes while cooking," said Grace Nakatudde, a Ugandan resident. "But after switching to briquettes, I spend less money on cooking and my kitchen no longer fills with fumes. I spend less money on cooking, going from 5,000 Ugandan shillings (about 1.30 USD) to 2,000 Ugandan shillings (about 0.52 USD) per day. Thanks to Asili Kwanzaa for providing such a great product."

Nakatudde is among hundreds of families in Uganda who use briquettes as a cooking fuel source.

Wood fuels: Necessary, but at what cost?

Wood fuels are the most widely used source of energy for cooking in sub-Saharan Africa, with over 90% of the population relying on firewood or charcoal. Charcoal is mostly used in urban areas, while firewood is the predominant form of wood fuel used in rural areas, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Wood fuels are essential, but their use has significant environmental and health costs.

Clean cooking is a major global challenge, with over 3 billion people relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking and heating. This indoor air pollution kills an estimated 4.1 million people each year, including 3.2 million from exposure to soot and smoke from traditional wood-burning cookstoves, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Some governments have tried to persuade their citizens to use other fuels, such as liquefied natural gas and electricity because wood burning is seen as outdated and environmentally unfriendly. However, many people cannot afford to use cleaner alternatives and spend long hours each day searching for fuel wood, or resort to collecting and using various forms of biomass, such as grass, shrubs, sawdust, wood chips, trimmings, twigs, animal dung, crop residue, and related plant materials.

The burden of this health crisis falls disproportionately on women and children, as they spend more time in close proximity to the smoke from traditional cooking methods, reports WHO.

Women's role in clean cooking

Women bear the brunt of traditional cooking methods, says clean energy expert Ifeoma Malo. Malo is the Chief Executive at Clean Technology Hub, a pioneering hybrid hub for the research, development, demonstration, and incubation of clean energy ideas, technologies, and resources for clean energy organisations and environment and climate-friendly initiatives across Africa.

Women face grave health risks due to the smoke and residue from their open fire stoves as well as their daily struggles to find enough wood. "While women take up the majority of the burden of cooking activities globally, the heavier risks and costs are largely borne by lower-income countries," she said. "These risks are not just physical and medical (such as the health risks associated with smoke inhalation from cooking with kerosene or firewood); they also bear the risk of traveling far distances to fetch firewood, as well as the risks of sexual harassment."

Malo added that clean cooking access can help mitigate the burden of domestic chores for women and give them more time for other activities. "Thus, if we want to improve clean cooking, women must play a significant role and receive special attention, even as advocates for clean cooking," she said.

"Women are essential to expanding access to clean cooking because they are the primary users and decision-makers, and because clean cooking can improve their health, well-being, and economic opportunities," she said. "Sustainable development and the enhancement of the lives of millions of people worldwide depend on involving and empowering women in clean cooking projects."

Benefits and drawbacks of using briquettes as a clean cooking source

Briquettes are a clean cooking source that offers a number of benefits, said Malo. Briquettes produce fewer emissions and contribute less to indoor air pollution, which can lead to better health outcomes. Briquettes are also more efficient, meaning that they require less fuel and produce more heat for cooking. This can save time and money, and reduce the need for fuel collection, which is often a burden on women and girls. It can help to reduce deforestation by lowering the demand for firewood and charcoal and can be made from agricultural waste and crop byproducts. This can provide an extra source of income for rural communities.

Ndyamuhahi the benefits of clean cooking for women, especially for housewives in Uganda. "Clean cooking solutions protect housewives from the harmful fumes emitted by traditional cooking methods. These fumes can cause respiratory problems, hair loss, and other health problems," he said.

"Women can also save money on cooking fuel. Ugandan housewives typically receive a daily allowance from their husbands, known as Kameeza money, which means 'table money.' This money is usually a subsistence allowance left by husbands in the morning before they go to work. This money is used to cover the cost of basic household expenses. Since housewives do not have a source of income, saving money on cooking fuel is a significant benefit. Asili Kwanzaa also employs some women as salespeople, providing them with an additional source of income."

Despite the many advantages of briquettes as a clean cooking source, there are also some drawbacks to consider, said Malo. "Briquette production can be labour-intensive and requires specialised tools that may not be easily accessible in some locations. Briquette production requires infrastructure and machinery setup, which can be expensive and burdensome for some people and communities. Depending on the ingredients and manufacturing processes, briquette quality can differ. Lower-grade briquettes may burn inefficiently and emit more smoke. Briquettes are also less available than conventional fuels on the market, and access to them can be restricted in some areas. Briquettes must be carefully transported and stored, just like other types of fuel. In some instances, storage space or shipping expenses may be an obstacle."

"It can be difficult to persuade people to transition from conventional fuels to briquettes. Cooking habits can be strongly influenced by cultural preferences and behaviours," she added. Despite these drawbacks, briquettes remain a promising clean cooking solution with the potential to improve the health, well-being, and economic opportunities of millions of people around the world.

Future of Clean Cooking in the Global South

In order to make rapid progress towards clean cooking, various enabling factors must be addressed, including raising awareness about traditional cooking methods' environmental and health impacts, providing access to clean and affordable cooking technologies, ensuring capacity building and financial support for the development of sustainable fuel supply chains, and providing access to affordable and clean cooking technologies.

Ndyamuhahi envisions a bright future for clean cooking in the global South. He says that "despite the challenges, the future of clean cooking in the global South is bright, thanks to the growing number of initiatives in this space. For example, we are not only looking at improved biomass fuel manufacturing but also at innovative solutions such as solar-aided stoves and affordable low-cost clean cooking technologies. Additionally, there are many other players involved in the clean cooking sector, which validates my statement that the future is bright. Finally, people are increasingly adopting clean cooking technologies because they are tired of traditional cooking methods and the associated health and environmental problems."

Ndyamuhahi believes carbon credits could help with costs for users. It can play a significant role in the future of clean cooking by helping companies to lower the cost of their products for consumers, making them more affordable.

At the Africa Climate Summit, clean cooking was highlighted as a priority climate solution for a sustainable future in Africa

Ndyamuhahi says "I see carbon finance as a very promising avenue for achieving universal access to clean cooking by 2030. It can help business players subsidise clean cooking technologies, making them more affordable for grassroots people. For example, a carbon offset project or agent could give 80% of the cost of an improved stove, leaving the final user to pay just 20%. This would make these solutions much more scalable on the ground. I see carbon finance as a good way to scale up clean cooking and other climate-related solutions for grassroots people, because I've seen it work with others."

The African Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) was launched at the United Nations Climate Conference (COP27). It promised to unlock billions in climate finance for Africa, but climate activists warn that it is a dangerous distraction from reducing emissions at the source. A new report, Africa Carbon Markets Initiative: A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, by climate think tank Power Shift Africa and partners details the dangers of carbon credits and why African leaders must avoid falling into the trap of adopting them. The report shows that the ACMI is riddled with deficiencies and inconsistencies, and will only fling open the floodgates of pollution.

World needs global pledge on renewables, energy efficiency

In Sub-Saharan Africa, over 600 million people lack access to electricity, and almost a billion do not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. Africa has the largest gap in clean cooking access, and its clean cooking plans often lack resources. At present, less than a third of these plans are funded, and the COVID-19 pandemic and high fuel prices have led to a reduction in incentives and financial support for households, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

However, Africa can overcome its energy challenges and provide reliable, cost-effective energy access to all by 2030 by harnessing its abundant renewable resources, including abundant sunlight and strong winds.

Ndyamuhahi spoke about the partnerships he has established in Africa to expand his clean cooking mission.

"I have established several partnerships in Uganda, given the scale at which I am currently operating. My partners are mainly business development partners, such as Challenges Uganda, an arm of Challenges Worldwide. They are supporting me with business strategising. I also have a partnership with Masrcorp company, which manufactures improved stoves specifically designed for briquettes. We have a business-to-business collaboration where they sell my products to their clients.

"I have also established a partnership with Green Africa Youth Organisation (GAYO), which is supporting me with linkages to potential funders and investing in business modeling and strategising on how to tackle the problem of waste. GAYO has established a zero-waste project in Kampala .. and have waste pickers who are related to my business for taking of the waste recycling."

"The uptake of clean technology will transform the energy landscape by reducing reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating climate change, and promoting sustainable development," said energy expert Malo. "Clean technologies adoption can lead to a more environmentally friendly energy system with significant benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating the transition to renewable energy, improving air quality, enhancing energy independence, and creating job opportunities. It also drives technological advancements, promotes energy efficiency, increases resilience to climate change, and stimulates economic growth," she added. "However, these benefits require addressing infrastructure, regulatory, and financial challenges through collaborative efforts from governments, businesses, and communities."

Africa's green future - Jobs, sustainability, and transition

"Young people can position themselves for green jobs by training and retooling themselves in relevant skills. This could include learning how to recycle, make improved stoves, or other green technologies. The green economy is a broad field, so young people should be flexible and open to new opportunities," Ndyamuhahi said.

"The potential for green jobs is significant, as more and more companies are adopting sustainability practices and incorporating green manufacturing into their operations. If everyone continues to adopt sustainability principles, the potential for green jobs is vast. African governments need to establish solid structures and working policies to achieve a green economy. If you look at different countries in Africa at the moment, there are many examples of where these structures and policies are lacking".

For example, in Uganda, there is a problem with people encroaching on natural resources, even though there are laws in place prohibiting this. This is because the government is unable to enforce these laws. This is a problem because the problems we have in Africa stem from structures and policies that do not work."

"Without working structures and policies, it will be difficult to regenerate industries, encourage cooperation on green economy initiatives, and invest in the technology needed to usher in a green economy," said Ndyamuhahi. "This includes investing in technology, such as digital payments, to reduce the use of paper and other resources."

He urged African governments to invest in transitions to clean energy and sustainable manufacturing. This would help to create jobs and boost economic growth, while also protecting the environment. "The most effective way to use green energy is to be sustainable at your own level," added Ndyamuhahi. "This means using energy wisely and efficiently, regardless of the source. We also need to incorporate green energy into manufacturing to reduce the amount of energy needed to produce goods."

Make-or-Break Issues at COP28

As the 28th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) climate summit approaches, African countries are hoping to advance their climate agendas and advocate for more global action.

The upcoming summit is generating excitement for a groundbreaking event: the first Global Stocktake, a critical component of the Paris Agreement. The Global Stocktake is a two-year process that happens every five years and assesses the global response to the climate crisis. This is an opportunity for countries to agree on concrete milestones toward achieving their 2030 targets, including climate adaptation, finance, and technology.

For Africa, this process is critical as the continent only contributes about 4% to global greenhouse gas emissions but is disproportionately affected by the climate crisis, with increased droughts, floods, and other weather-related disasters, impacting food security and socio-economic development. The Global Stocktake is an opportunity to ensure that the international community lives up to its commitments and that climate action reflects the deep transformations needed across all sectors to build a resilient future for Africa and the world. At COP28, countries must commit to using the stocktake's findings to keep the 1.5°C goal alive and address the impacts of the climate crisis.

COP27, also known as the "Africa COP," was held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, and resulted in a significant milestone - the agreement on a loss and damage fund.  However, many issues remain unresolved. At COP28, African delegates are expected to focus on loss and damage, climate finance, and energy transitions. They will urge other countries to adopt ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, renewable energy, and low-carbon technologies, and cooperate more closely with developing nations by providing financial and technological assistance. Last but not least, they will advocate for climate justice and equity, arguing that developed countries should take the lead in mitigating the climate crisis and supporting vulnerable communities.

As for Ndyamuhahi, he wants to see more investment in climate solutions that reach the people who need them most.

Hopes for the future of climate action in Africa

Ndyamuhahi said that his hope for the future is that young people see themselves as solution providers to the climate crisis. He envisions himself as a leader and a practitioner in providing real solutions and alternatives to help everyone make a small contribution towards solving the climate crisis.

He believes that climate activism is important, but that it is not enough to simply tell people what not to do. We need to offer solutions and alternatives. For example, instead of telling people to stop using plastic bags, we need to provide them with affordable and accessible alternatives.

Ndyamuhahi wants to be the person who says: 'Don't cut down trees. Use briquettes for cooking. Use an improved stove. Use this instead of that, and I have justifiable reasons for what I'm saying.'

"I encourage young people and others to take it upon themselves to be solution creators and value creators. This is what we stand for as young people, and it is what we need to do to rebuild ourselves and the communities we serve. Many portray Africans as poor people, but we need to change the narrative and address that problem. While we are fighting climate change, we can also look at it as a precursor for providing solutions to poverty," he said.

HD 	U.S. Clearly Knows What 'Global South' Least Wants to Hear At UNGA

Starting from yesterday, the high level week of the 78th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) began and will last until September 26.

Compared to previous ones, this year's UNGA has placed a greater emphasis on the "Global South" countries.

TD 
	

Several high-level meetings to be held during the General Assembly will focus on the priorities of developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia, including climate, health and financing.

Countries in the South have also influenced and responded to the agendas of the UNGA with a stronger spirit of unity and cooperation as well as a sense of "being the host."

The director of an international think tank believes that "this is a year when the countries of the Global South have set the agenda."

For this year's high-level week of the UNGA, Secretary-General António Guterres has long had high hopes, hoping to "help rescue the Sustainable Development Goals."

The term "rescue" reveals the current difficulties faced by global development, and also reflects the unbridgeable rift between developing and developed countries.

What Guterres mentioned is a fundamental change in the current international situation, that is, the collective rise of developing countries, which brings a call for a more just and reasonable international order.

Meanwhile, established major powers such as the US and the West are trying hard to maintain their dominance and resorting to every possible means to discredit, attack and suppress this call. It must be said that this contradiction is the deep factor causing the current geopolitical division.

For example, what the international community, mainly developing countries, most hope to discuss at the UNGA is how to solve poverty, alleviate high inflation, cope with climate change, among other issues.

They hope to promote sustainable development through multilateral dialogues.

The key words of the general debate -- peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all -- which are generally regarded as the "highlights" of the UNGA, also fully reflect this strong desire.

What these countries are most worried about is that the Ukraine crisis will once again become the dominant topic in the UNGA and shift people's attention from development issues.

The endless chatter about war and overt and covert threats made against other countries, forcing them to pick sides, are the last thing these countries want to hear.

However, while the US pays attention to the "Global South," it also declared that "the world cannot address one without the other," meaning the Ukraine crisis and development issues. This shows that the US is well aware of the demands of developing countries, but it insists on bringing in its own agendas at multilateral forums.

There are many similar examples, all of which strongly prove without exception that the practice of bringing geopolitical calculations into multilateral occasions has undermined global cooperation efforts and wasted many opportunities for developing countries and developed nations to reach compromises, reconciliation, and cooperation.

It has also severely limited the effectiveness of previously well-functioning multilateral platforms.

This is regrettable.

In this process, the US and the West have continuously demonised the legitimate and just demands of developing countries using their powerful public opinion tools.

On the eve of the opening of a series of important meetings at the United Nations General Assembly, the G77 + China Summit was held in Havana, the capital of Cuba, from September 15 to 16.

The participating representatives unanimously passed the Havana Declaration, which underscored the "right to development in an increasingly exclusive, unfair, unjust, and plundering international order."

This became a collective call from developing countries before the high-level meetings at the UNGA. However, it remains uncertain to what extent the voices and concerns of "Global South" countries and the UN Secretary-General can be heard by the representatives of developed countries inside the UNGA in New York.

The US and other Western countries are clearly increasing their efforts to win over the "Global South," but it is evident that this is not about granting developing countries a more equal status and development opportunities, but rather an attempt to continue to confine them to the periphery of the "centre-periphery" system.

The reality is that developing countries are now more awake and capable of maintaining independence and autonomy than ever before. This is not only reflected in their cautious and balanced approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict but also in their clear-headedness and calmness in the face of US instigation for confrontation against China and Russia.

The UNGA is the most representative multilateral forum globally, and the US and the West should be more humble here and clearly see the mainstream direction of the international community. -- Global Times

HD 	The Global North Should Focus on Climate Accountability, Not Just Compensation

Vast swathes of ancient forest are cut for timber. Oil is endlessly extracted from wells cut deep in the ground. And as countless species are irrecoverably driven to extinction, factories continue to belch pollution, clouding our once-clear skies.

For this destruction, the Global North has historically held the most responsibility - their insatiable demand for resources is driving near-constant extraction from the Global South. Equipped with wood, oil and metals, the Global North has advanced economically, leaving many in the Global South unable to keep pace.

TD 
	

Although this dynamic undoubtedly continues, the Global North is learning. As more people look to make amends, some have suggested compensation to be the answer. But in response, I ask, "How?"

Is the destruction not already too severe? Can any amount of financial assistance really compensate for the damage inflicted upon people and nature in the Global South?

Time is not infinite. The climate crisis is moving fast and we have commitments to fulfill by 2030 - a short seven years from now. Faced with so little time, I urge the North to look beyond compensation and instead help the Global South to advance economically without repeating their own calamitous, climate mistakes.

So little time is left to avert worse climate disasters than Africa already is experiencing.

There's no question that to develop economically, the Global South must use its resources; the challenge will be to do so sustainably. Here in Tanzania, multiple groups are reliant upon our country's natural assets. Hunter gatherer communities count on trees and bushes, pastoral communities need space for their grazing livestock and our growing urban population depends on rural areas to provide them with food and fuel.

While every community differs in their use and valuation of land, something each has in common is a need to survive. In Tanzania, meeting the costs of healthcare and education can be challenging, leaving people little choice but to tap into their most accessible natural asset - trees. Forests are cleared to make way for subsistence agriculture and are also cut to produce charcoal to supply the urban market.

While the Global North would call this deforestation, to many in the Global South it is simply a means to an end. But although tree clearance helps to meet immediate household expenses, it is only a short-term solution. Once a tree is cut, it is cut. That's it; it is gone.

Efforts have been made to curb deforestation in Tanzania, but something is clearly lacking. Perhaps due to the scale of the challenge, Global North aid and Official Development Assistance have so far left the local drivers of deforestation - that is meeting an individual's daily needs for food, fuel and income - relatively unaddressed. Therefore, even when the environmental value of forests is theoretically understood by local people, in daily life, their worth continues to lie in the tangible, financial support they can provide a family.

The wealthy countries most responsible for climate change must support sustainable revenues to meet human needs in countries least responsible for global warming. 

To fulfil our 2030 climate commitments, Tanzania and the Global South need solutions that create real-life, financial incentives to leave trees standing. Only then do I believe we can address the entrenched, local drivers of deforestation.

Despite its use for advocacy and research work, Global North aid has so far proved ineffective for building value in standing trees. This is not to say it is an unsuitable mechanism. Done well, aid can effectively transfer finance from North to South and if developed, could certainly incentivise the protection of forests. However, aid often remains vulnerable to the changing winds of political priority. It can arrive wrapped in complex conditions that limit its ability to reach the hands of local people. This is problematic - unless the benefits of aid are felt in a person's daily life, the need to cut trees will continue to persist.

Given the limitations of currently available Global North aid, the Global South is ready to embrace and scale additional solutions. One promising option is carbon finance - a market-based model that helps companies in the Global North achieve ambitious emission reduction targets while supporting conservation and restoration projects in the Global South.

While still working with the economies of the Global North, carbon finance differs from aid. In Tanzania, project developers work from the ground up to conserve and restore the country's forests. As a form of natural climate mitigation, these projects work to prevent greenhouse gas emissions and to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From here, a number of carbon credits - equivalent to the volume of avoided or removed CO2 - can be traded via the voluntary carbon market. Sold to predominantly Global North companies, revenues from credit sales are returned to the forest communities. Not only does this support individuals with their daily living expenses, but it can radically alter their relationships with nature. In experiencing first-hand lasting improvements to their livelihoods, people understand that trees provide greater benefit if left standing.

In the places I work, carbon finance is currently directed to health and education schemes. Why would you convert land to increase income for school fees if your children received scholarships? What would be your incentive to produce charcoal if you could cover your healthcare costs by just leaving your local trees intact? You want people to think, "if I clear it, I get less." When communities understand that this additional revenue comes from their standing trees, then you are making progress on deforestation.

The Global North certainly has a responsibility to cut its emissions and curb its demands, but this is not all. In addition, these countries must support the Global South as we seek to advance economically, socially and environmentally.

Yes, aid can be beneficial, but it is not the only answer to the climate crisis. With the right support, aid and carbon finance can complement each other, creating blended finance opportunities for the Global South. Aid alone is not enough, we need the voluntary carbon market to mobilise private finance too. Carbon finance can break down the historically entrenched imbalances that ensure finance remains held, seemingly permanently, by those in the Global North. It can transfer corporate capital straight to the hands of Global South citizens to incentivise forest conservation, provide greater agency and alleviate everyday financial challenges. I can see no alternative but to scale the carbon market in support the Global South. And on this, the Global North must be held accountable.

Azaria Kilimba works extensively with Tanzania's forest communities through Carbon Tanzania, an impact-driven social enterprise that generates value for Tanzania's economy and its people by producing carbon credits that enable local people to earn revenues from the protection of their landscape and allow global businesses with credible decarbonisation strategies to invest in locally produced solutions that serve climate, communities and wildlife. While working for WWF and other NGOs in rural Tanzania, he saw communities benefit from innovative enterprises that valued forests through tourism and non-timber products. In search of a mechanism that would scale investment in community forest conservation, generate greater levels of finance, and further boost the value of community-owned natural resources, he joined Carbon Tanzania as Operations Manager.

The Lobito Corridor infrastructure project casts the United States and the West in an unfamiliar role.

United States (US) President Joe Biden sounded positively Xi Jinping-ish this week when he said the New Delhi G20 summit provided a 'new path' that would save everybody money and increase the global south's capacity to grow.

TD 
	

Biden was referring to a new corridor from India to the Middle East and Britain, including new railroads, shipping lanes and pipelines. Xi wasn't at the summit, but this seemed like an alternative to his famous Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) connecting China to Europe - with tentacles snaking off to Africa.

Biden and the leaders of India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union (EU) announced the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor at the G20's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) event.

Biden added an African dimension, saying another G20 project was a railroad across Africa. The first stage will support rehabilitation of the existing Lobito Corridor - a 1 300 km Angolan railway that continues for 400 km in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Kolwezi, the heart of the Copperbelt.

The corridor is the shortest route to US and European markets for DRC and Zambian minerals and products

The 30-year concession was awarded to the Lobito Atlantic Railway consortium, a joint venture by Trafigura, international construction company Mota-Engil and independent railway operator Vecturis.

To some degree piggy-backing on what was the Benguela corridor, largely built by China, the US and EU have partnered to develop the corridor from the Angolan Port of Lobito through the DRC to Zambia. 'The greenfield Zambia-Lobito rail line connecting Zambia and Angola will be the largest single US and EU investment in [Africa] in a generation,' the US says. It's the shortest route to American and European markets for the DRC and Zambian minerals and other products.

Helaina Matza, PGI acting US Special Coordinator, said the G7's PGI was created in 2022 to close the infrastructure gap in emerging economies. An initial US$600 billion was pledged to finance the PGI over five years, of which the US had committed to US$200 billion. The Lobito Corridor was its first 'flagship' project, she said.

Matza said the EU joined the project at the recent G20 summit, and aimed to provide 'loan assistance' to refurbish the existing railway to Kolwezi and then on to Zambia (and beyond). She said currently it took about three weeks to port, mainly by road. The Lobito Corridor could reduce that to four days, and would concretise the African Continental Free Trade Area.

The project needs more support from the private than government sector, and so far business interest is low

The corridor's main purpose has been to carry minerals from the DRC and Zambia to Lobito Port. The aim is to develop commerce along the route, like agribusiness. The US is already exploring providing financial support for feeder roads to the railway in Zambia to carry agricultural produce to market.

Matza acknowledged that 'infrastructure has not been the traditional way we show up in Africa,' but the US and other partners had responded to the continent's appeals. Perhaps implicitly contrasting with China, she said the US and EU would provide their backing 'in a meaningful way ... that supports our values and our objectives, which includes supporting democracies, regional connectivity, and ... creating diversity in supply chains and trade routes.'

Angolan Transport Minister Ricardo Viegas d'Abreu told ISS Today that the Lobito Corridor's US and EU backing confirmed its importance in dynamising the economies of Angola, DRC and Zambia. Bob Wekesa, Wits University's African Centre for the Study of the United States Deputy Director, said US and EU support underscored the global competition between the West and China. Speaking to ISS Today, he said Western governments realised that the global south wanted more than 'preaching and proselytising' on governance issues.

However, Wekesa said the Lobito Corridor would transport raw materials to port, rather than value-added finished goods produced in Africa. That's no doubt true, though Matza said the US and its partners would try to drive US and Western downstream investment in the DRC-Zambia copper-cobalt belt. That appeared to be a nod to America's broader aim to keep strategic minerals in Africa rather than allowing them to be siphoned off to China in raw form.

Can Western countries knock China off its pedestal as the developing world's best friend?

The Western focus on infrastructure comes when China's Belt and Road Initiative is flagging, partly because it has largely been funded with Chinese loans, which recipients struggle to repay, and which have been opaque.

So, as Jakkie Cilliers, Head of African Futures and Innovation at the Institute for Security Studies points out, the critical questions about the Lobito Corridor loans will be their terms and interest rates, and whether they are public. He also flagged the need for common technical railway standards to harmonise the Chinese standards mostly being used in East Africa.

The sense that Biden was taking the gap left by Xi was palpable at the G20 summit. Beijing never publicly said why Xi didn't attend, but the weight of speculation was that he felt the host, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sought to bolster his aspiration to be the global south leader - a title Xi evidently claims for himself.

So Biden came with proposals to boost World Bank funding for development finance. There was also broad agreement to reform the Bretton Woods Institutions. But can Western countries knock China off its pedestal as the developing world's best friend? The Lobito Corridor could be the test.

It will require more support from the private than government sector, and so far, business enthusiasm is low. Reuters recently reported that only one mining company had signed up to use the corridor. Matza agreed that long-term commitments were essential to getting the project off the ground, but was nevertheless optimistic.

The Lobito Corridor is an ambitious project with many moving parts, making it vulnerable to breakdown. Perhaps the demonstrated commitment of the US and the EU will encourage sceptical mining houses to climb on board.

A senior Ethiopian official and scholar has underlined the significant role of China in addressing the current crises facing developing nations and building a sustainable future, saying that Beijing has championed the interests of Africa and the Global South.

Arkebe Oqubay, a senior minister and special adviser to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, told a recent news conference in Beijing that "China has given an inspiration to developing countries, showing how a developing country can grow faster and can make structural transformation".

TD 
	

Oqubay, who had served as the mayor of Addis Ababa, spoke via video link at the release of the Global Development Report 2023 by the Center for International Knowledge on Development in Beijing.

He noted that Africa has been most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and seen its food security threatened by geopolitical conflicts including the Ukrainian crisis.

"Being an observer of China for over 30 years, and also actively involved in China-Africa relationship. I would like to highlight that the China-Africa cooperation has been an important driver of economic growth in my continent," he said.

The Ethiopian scholar highlighted the immense potential for Chinese investment into the manufacturing sector and agriculture of Africa, which boosts a significant potential with its demographic dynamics.

"China has done unmatched performance in the innovations related with green technology, in wind energy, in solar energy, in electric vehicles, in battery technology -- areas which has significantly contributed to the reduction of cost and also accessibility of these technologies by poor countries or least developing countries," he said.

Oqubay also applauded the recent expansion of the BRICS to include Ethiopia, saying that grouping is "an important economic alliance and important front for the Global South to play much more important roles".

The Ethiopian scholar also expressed hope that China can play much more important roles in building partnerships, improving the global governance system and creating a new global order.

"We want China to play an important role in addressing international inequality because we have seen at the momentum how this inequality worsened during the COVID crisis."

HD 	Building the South-South Feminist Archive - an Interview With Ghiwa Sayegh of Kohl Journal

Debating Ideas aims to reflect the values and editorial ethos of the African Arguments book series, publishing engaged, often radical, scholarship, original and activist writing from within the African continent and beyond. It offers debates and engagements, contexts and controversies, and reviews and responses flowing from the African Arguments books.

TD 
	

My first profound encounter with feminist academic literature was during my postgraduate degree in the UK. I was reading a journal article by Zimbabwean feminist activist Everjoice Win entitled 'Not very poor, powerless or pregnant: the African woman forgotten by development'. In it, Win writes of the erasure of the middle-class African woman from the imaginaries of development and rights work. This woman, as Win observes, is often reminded that development work is about aiding the resource-poor and that her own experiences of patriarchy and oppression are not relevant to this narrative. In the meantime, if she happens to work in the development field, her 'legitimacy' is only realised in her role as mediator, connecting grassroots women and issues to the language and practice of international development. Having had similar experiences, Win's articulations made me feel less alone. I shared excerpts of it on social media and immediately, other young Zimbabwean feminists gathered to share how those words bore witness to their own struggles.

The growth of digitality and digital spaces has offered many African women access to the writings of African feminists that they otherwise might not have had before. Journals like Feminist Africa have been pivotal to this growing consciousness. And so too have less academically oriented digital spaces. There is Holaafrica! which documents queer African women's experiences, Adventures from the Bedrooms of African Women in which agency rather than academic interrogation shapes the debate around African sexualities and African Feminism which creates space for an ongoing conversation about living feminist lives from an African standpoint. In the past there have been platforms like The Wide Margin, a feminist journal. There was also Her Zimbabwe platform I founded and ran for some years which encouraged young Zimbabwean women's engagement with feminist thought and practice. A feature of all these platforms has been to curate content and exchanges from African feminists across the continent and its diasporas; shaped by a desire to know how we feminists relate or rather do not; this in turn helps us better articulate our own feminisms and attendant identities.

Looking beyond one's physical and even intellectual locale into transnational/regional feminisms has also greatly enriched these practices. South-South feminisms, or feminist exchanges of the global South, have allowed a deepened nuance and diversity for African feminists and feminisms, introducing new thinking, new thinkers and new intersections. In the following interview, I speak to Ghiwa Sayegh, founder and editor in chief of Kohl: A Journal for Body and Gender Research, based in Beirut, Lebanon. A progressive publication published in both English and Arabic, it covers issues of gender and sexuality in the Middle East, South West Asia, and North Africa regions.

I first met Ghiwa some years ago at a convening of global South feminists to discuss feminist digital futures. What was striking was the ease with which we - alongside feminist activists and thinkers from South Asia, Latin America and other regions - seamlessly found ways to connect our varied work in creating digital feminist knowledge.

Kohl also intermittently publishes works from sub-Saharan Africa thus offering a unique contribution to transnational and South-South feminist activism and solidarity. Kohl in its resistance to an Area Studies approach, an academic methodology with roots in colonial epistemologies, is breaking geospatial (digital) boundaries where intersectional feminist practice is often seen as feminists of the global South coming together with those of the global North, versus global South feminists collaborating free of Western dependency. As already mentioned, this serves to create dynamic exchanges and potentiality for feminists whose experiences and knowledge are often missing from mainstream conversations.

This interview is a contribution to these radical forms of knowledge production.

Fungai Machirori (FM): What was the prompting, thinking and vision behind starting a journal like Kohl?

Ghiwa Sayegh (GS): There were many factors to that and they were linked together, but also separate. I remember one of the earlier conversations, even before Kohl was in place. It was among researchers, particularly those who are part of academic institutions. And it looked at the kind of constraints that academic institutions imposed on people who are part of those spaces.

For example, what really shocked me was that publishing in Open Access journals did not contribute towards academic promotion, say from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor to full Professor. Similarly, publications in local journals do not count, so researchers who are part of institutional academia must mainly publish in what is considered an 'A-rated' journal, those mainly curated and published in the UK, United States, or Europe. This kind of knowledge production is confined to the academic institutional level.

Also within my own feminist activism, which started way before my academic or research work, what we were seeing, a practice we were not very happy about, was the arrival of white researchers to Beirut to meet with lesbian feminists. They spend a few days gathering data 'in the field' and go back to do the writing of theses, articles, newspaper articles and so on. It meant that we were transformed in the process to mere subjects of interviews, but not subjects of the research, because there was no time or resources put into that community.

At the same time, there was a kind of a collective amnesia more generally in terms of our histories and the activism of our foremothers; even women who organised before and during the civil war were not perceived as part of feminist history. There was a gap between what had been before and what we - as the post-war generation - were trying to do, in a sense.

For me, I realised that a lot is lost because what we have now is a hegemonic narrative that excludes our discourse and history. So the idea was to be able to, on the one hand, counter narratives about us that we have no say in. And on the other hand, to be able to archive and 'storytise' our struggles, through emphasising things that are important to us, even if we do not reach a definite conclusion on them.

Discourse is always contested; it is a site of contestation and also a site of activism. Even if it's not a discourse that represents all the young feminists in Lebanon. The debate should not be for the sake of representation - it would be a locality where we could have and keep those conversations, most importantly as a way of archiving.

Writing is a way of archiving after all.

FM: You mentioned that one of the things that surprised you was finding out that Open Access didn't count towards professional academic growth. How then is Kohl perceived? Are contributions by academic activists in it contributing to the professional trajectory of the academic?

GS: If they work in institutions, I don't think it does and I'm not just talking about Kohl; it is the same with other Open Access platforms as well. But although it does not give you a direct professional 'benefit' at an institutional level, being able to publish on this platform is also a political statement. So I do think that, yes, for many it is a kind of strong political statement - being able to publish in places that are not heavily institutionalised means you are part of a counter institutional movement in knowledge production - in feminist knowledge specifically.

FM: Why do you think it's important for Kohl to have a mix of academic papers as well as op-eds and artivist content? Most journals tend to be academically oriented even though they do have opinion pieces.

GS: I think it goes both ways in the sense that there is a binary between activism and academia. So initially, the idea was to break the boundaries of acceptable standards of research of what goes into a journal and what doesn't. What we are also doing is breaking the idea that academia can only be elitist; written for and by specific people who specialise in certain fields of knowledge, distinct from an activist body of knowledge. While we do get typical academic submissions, we mostly work with activists so we expand the boundaries on both sides of the binaries.

There is a lot of backlash now in terms of what academia is, at least in Lebanon. This is in terms of activists accusing academia of taking over their struggle and not consulting them on certain things. The way this has been employed, from what I have seen, is that it has been a way to silence any criticism classified as academic or not on the ground. This is quite homogenising as many feminist knowledge projects are anti-institutional; we also cannot overlook the struggle of other feminist researchers from within institutions, who are fighting the structures they have to operate under on a daily basis. And this is part of the reason why Kohl started. So I think what we do at Kohl is to really try and push boundaries and reclaim discourse as a legitimate side of raising concerns, but also as a way of doing activism.

FM: You also mention on your website how you are trying to deviate from the NGOised narrative. So on one hand you have this NGOised narrative while on the other, you have an 'academicalised' narrative. Activists sometimes fall outside of both spaces because the NGOised space is not radical enough in some circumstances, and then the academic space uses language that is not accessible to the general audience. So how does that work in terms of keeping focus and not making Kohl a space that is not too academic, but then also not too NGO-ised? How do you mix this kind of meeting of spheres in a way that reaches the intended audience?

GS: This is why we have a very long process of editing. The whole thing takes six months, which is long for us as editors. So we don't just send comments and say do your thing. It's a close follow-up with the authors and we do have long discussions about specific issues, like when they have to tone their jargon down and how to write in a way that is democratic. Another point is how to unpack certain issues that are assumed within the NGOisation discourse, like the idea of success stories on the one hand and victimisation stories on the other, how it is that we can look at these critically and not simply in a way that portrays winners or losers. I think that one of the characteristics or consequences of NGOisation is that the movement itself becomes NGOised through its institutionalisation through funding, reporting and social media advocacy. Focus on image and branding also means that nuanced conversations are swept under the carpet. Through Kohl we are trying to bring them back out.

FM: You mentioned something which is very interesting, which is to democratise language. What does democratic language look like to you given the different power dynamics of language, and of speaking and of being spoken of? And what ultimately would that democratic language look like in a journal like Kohl and in general?

GS: I would say that it would be a language that would deconstruct the image of the intellectual as a kind of an elite who is able to write in a certain way versus the rest of the population. I think what I would like to see is for everyone to have different ways of producing knowledge and not to be confined to this image of an intellectual researcher. On the other hand, among people who already write, I ideally would like to see a style of writing that would be accessible to as many people as possible. I think this is the problem of theory; we have feminist theory that is not accessible to feminists. So democratic language is how we write for each other, and not just write in this academic way, but rather give back to the communities that shape what we are writing into being.

FM: How do you retain your autonomy given that you are also subject to receiving funding to assist with the process of production? Obviously, in order to produce in the capitalist system which we all find ourselves in, we need money. So how do you then retain your editorial independence in producing the journal?

GS: We have two main guidelines in terms of funders. The first one is we don't take money from just anybody. We do not take money from state departments or embassies and we don't take money from any other entity that supports or directly funds the occupation of Palestine. That is one guideline that we have.

The second one is we would not collaborate with a funder who wants a say in the journal's editorial process. This has happened many times before. Many funders have asked us to publish a thematic issue of their choice as a prerequisite to funding. So it's these kinds of difficult choices. But it's also being able to find what would work well with our editorial ethos and not compromise just because we need funding.

This approach is reflected in our struggle to continue as we never have enough funding. Ours is a political choice and we might be more open to exploring crowdfunding in the future, with the possibility of retaining both funding streams at the same time. We are considering donations so that we are not fully reliant on funders.

Of course, mere guidelines of funding do not exempt us from NGOisation. What we try to do is to frequently have open and difficult conversations about power - ours and others' - while working on long term accountability processes.

FM: Beyond journal titles and platforms contributing to feminist knowledge and information, what does the feminist archive look like to you? Also, how do we build it further?

GS: On the one hand, the archive is what you want it to be. I think that on the collective level, we cannot dissociate archive from memory and it is the process of making memory in formats that are legible and recognisable. Because the archive is there, we are not inventing the archive. It is there. It is just how to make it readable and how to transmit it. The written format is not the only way. With the way that technology is moving forward, I think that the written and visual formats are taking over other forms of knowledge transmission and or historicising. So how is it that we can transform the archive to a format that is legible and timeless, but maybe that is not too romanticised? I am talking about a way that will allow it to sustain itself.

FM: That's also where we need to create new language because what is sustainability if we cannot find different terminologies for it? Where do you think this terminology is coming from and why is it so connotative of so many different things and how can we deconstruct that language?

GS: Deconstruction is an ongoing process in feminist knowledge production, it is also a constant debate, especially in terms of language. Is the language imposed or can it be given different connotations? So that is also another discussion that we often have with our contributors.

FM: What about the process of knowledge and information convergence? How do you think we are bringing people from various realms into one space to think: 'this is "our" archive and it's for all of us to partake and engage in'. For a long time, we have been operating as though the archive should be one monolithic thing that should speak to all people at all times. In our organising we have been bringing different people into spaces which don't always work out because people are expecting different things and some people get left along the way. This contrasts with feminist solidarity that tries to bring people from 'different walks of life' into one space. I also think of these spaces as a reflection of the archive where we say we want everyone to have access but then when we do bring people into these spaces, when we do say let's navigate this archive together, it's often very technical and exclusionary. So how do we overcome this?

GS: I think there is no one archive that speaks to everybody, it's okay to acknowledge that. I also think that's part of the major issue with our organising. We are so set on the fantasy of unity in the sense that we have to be united at times of 'crisis' despite differences, as if we are not in a constant state of urgency. In a sense, it is actually a setback for the movement and the archive. I think this also needs to be deconstructed in the sense that solidarity is important but being united uncompromisingly will not do the movement any good.

I perceive the archive in the same way. When I say the archive, I look at the body of knowledge. If we look at the specific contributions of a specific community and try to fit everybody to that, sometimes it is not possible, and that is okay. It does not mean that we should not have a process of self-reflection or of thinking who it is that we are excluding and why. Is it because of privilege or it is because we want to actively be a community that is segregated for one reason or another? I think these conversations need to happen but that does not mean that they would necessarily need to be unified and have an archive produced at a certain moment and time to document them. We, of course, would need to ask ourselves how it is that we stick within our positionalities and how we are contributing in further obscuring the histories of others. So these conversations need to happen but it doesn't mean that whatever we work on needs to be for everybody - sometimes it needs to be intentionally not for certain people.

FM: What is the longevity you see for Kohl? Do you see a time when there won't be a necessity for a journal like it, or is that not something that you factor into your thinking?

GS: I think there will always be a necessity for feminist platforms of knowledge and it's not about the name or the people; it's about being able to offer that space. I don't know if Kohl is going to be here in 20 years, but I hope that what we are doing is contributing to a movement of feminist knowledge production. And that it will serve as an archive for other movements to be able to pick up on later. Whether it will still be called Kohl or whatever they want, or on different platforms, contributing to the movement and the archive is what is most important to us.

To highlight the importance of ongoing cooperation between countries of the Global South, the UN commemorated its annual Day for South-South Cooperation on Tuesday.

This year's official theme is "Solidarity, Equity, and Partnership: Unlocking South-South Cooperation to Achieve the SDGs."

TD 
	

South-South cooperation is a manifestation of solidarity contributing to national well-being, national and collective self-reliance, and the attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Coming just ahead of the two-day SDG Summit, the commemoration is an opportunity for the Global South to emphasize the needs of various regions and accelerate practical action towards sustainable development targets.

"In our world of deeply connected challenges, South-South cooperation plays a vital role in shaping a brighter future," said UN Secretary-General António Guterres.

"The United Nations Day for South-South Cooperation is a powerful reminder that when nations unite, they can overcome obstacles and accelerate sustainable development."

He said it was "only together" that we can forge a world of shared prosperity, "where cooperation knows no borders."

Collaborative spirit

Examples of cooperation among the Global South include Cuba's support combatting Ebola in West Africa, the Republic of Congo assisting family farming and school feeding programmes in Brazil, and UNESCO facilitating exchanges between the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu to improve the teaching capacity of educators.

To boost this collaborative spirit, the UN Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC), promotes both South-South and triangular cooperation.

Triangular cooperation is a collaboration in which donor countries and multilateral organizations facilitate South-South initiatives through funding, training, management, and providing technological systems, in addition to other forms of support.

Collective self-reliance

South-South cooperation is conducted through a broad framework of collaboration among countries of the Global South in the political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, and technical domains.

Through South-South collaboration, developing countries share knowledge, skills, expertise, and resources to meet their development goals through coordinated efforts.

"From climate action to poverty eradication, from healthcare to education, from trade to digitalisation, solidarity and strong partnerships between developing countries can pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable world," said Mr. Guterres.

"As we mark the United Nations Day for South-South Cooperation, let us recognize this form of collaboration as an essential catalyst for change, embodying solidarity, innovation, and mutual support," concluded the Secretary-General.

President Bola Tinubu has declared that the G-20 would remain incomplete without Nigeria and expressed the nation's commitment to play a leading role within the group and contribute to shaping a more equitable world as Africa's largest economy, market, and democracy.

Addressing the world leaders at the 18th G-20 Leaders' Summit in New Delhi, India yesterday, the president emphasised that "Nigeria is poised, able and willing to be a major player in this family of the G-20 and in shaping a new world, without whom, the family will remain incomplete."

TD 
	

He called for global unity and cooperation in tackling pressing challenges, fostering inclusiveness, and establishing a fairer world order.

While acknowledging the vital role of the G-20 in shaping a rules-based world order that promotes shared prosperity and security, President Tinubu emphasised that most of today's pressing issues are "international in character and cannot be addressed without multilateral cooperation.

"Therefore, stronger collaboration, cooperation, and partnerships among diverse regions are the pathways to a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable future for our world.

"This is why the role and contributions of the G-20 in shaping a new world order that is fair and rules-based cannot be over-emphasised. A world that lives as one family, but is divided by staggering income inequalities and uneven access to basic social goods by the vast majority of our people cannot result in a peaceful and secure world where shared prosperity is achieved.

"I hasten to add that such rules and global governance structures of our collective dreams must be collectively designed, collectively owned, and collectively managed. This is consistent with the true spirit of One Family, mutual respect, and sustainable development".

The president congratulated India for hosting the historic summit and for successfully landing on the moon under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He described the achievement as an inspiration to all developing countries of the Global South.

On the issue of African Union (AU) inclusion in the G-20, President Tinubu welcomed the decision, saying it "opens opportunities for future membership of the group in a manner that reflects the relative balance of power and inclusiveness of humanity as One Family."

Reflecting on the theme of the Summit: 'One Earth. One Family. One Future,' the president stressed the interconnectedness of global affairs and the need for collaborative efforts.

He underscored the importance of tackling challenges related to technology, energy transition, and access to credit, as well as the growing socio-economic divide between those who have and those who do not.

President Tinubu urged greater solidarity among nations, tasking advanced economies to support disadvantaged regions in the Global South and to promote climate justice.

He also called for the strengthening of international frameworks for resource mobilisation and governance that are based on the principles of justice, equity, and fairness.

In addressing the sub-theme of Session II of the Summit, which is One Family, the president highlighted the magnitude of challenges facing humanity today.

According to him: "The need for us to work together as one family has, therefore, become more imperative. We must strive to create a world of inclusiveness in which everyone has access to the necessities of life, and in a manner that widens and strengthens the ownership of our planet regardless of one's economic, social, and political status."

President Tinubu urged the Global North, advanced economies, and multilateral institutions to mobilise resources and direct efforts to where help is needed most in the disadvantaged Global South.

"By doing so, we will be building a society anchored on the strong values of tolerance and mutual respect, where diplomacy, dialogue, and cooperation take precedence over competition, conflict, and divisions, which are based on inflexible ideologies and belief systems," the president further said.

HD 	Actionaid Launches Climate Justice Campaign

In a coalition for climate justice, ActionAid Rwanda (AAR) has joined hands with the ActionAid Federation to spearhead the Climate Justice Campaign with a theme 'FUND OUR FUTURE"

This collaboration started early this year and Monday, September 4, marked the beginning of a concerted effort to promote equitable investments in climate resilience.

TD 
	

The campaign is set to extend for three years.

ActionAid Rwanda's extensive interventions have been carried out across various Districts of Rwanda, namely Musanze, Karongi, Nyanza, Gisagara, and Nyaruguru, where Rights Holders share a national commitment to safeguarding the planet.

ActionAid Rwanda has been at the forefront of advocating for combating the effects of climate change by working with Rights Holders and other partners to implement impactful initiatives aimed at building resilience and ensuring environmental sustainability.

"Our work encompasses promoting community-led advocacy initiatives that include agroecology practices, climate-smart agriculture, afforestation efforts to mitigate carbon emissions, energy-saving cooking stoves, and educational campaigns focused on climate change adaptation and mitigation practices. Through these dedicated endeavors, ActionAid Rwanda has been empowering local communities to confront climate change head-on and nurture a more sustainable and resilient future for all," reads part of the statement.

The statement says that a pivotal aspect of ActionAid's initiative in its areas of intervention is the emphasis on promoting climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.

ActionAid Rwanda recognizes that climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable communities, especially women and girls. ActionAid is committed to promoting adaptive capacities that advance equity and justice.

The interventions are in line with government's green growth vision.

The Rwandan government has displayed a strong commitment to climate action by unveiling an ambitious agenda. This agenda commits to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 38% compared to business as usual by 2030, which equates to an estimated mitigation of up to 4.6 million tons of carbon emissions.

While such a commitment demonstrates dedication to combating climate change, a recent report from ActionAid International titled "How the Finance Flows: The Banks Fueling the Climate Crisis" sheds light on the significant role major international banks play in financing activities that perpetuate the climate crisis.

Notably, these banks have been funding fossil fuels and industrial agriculture in the Global South, both major contributors to climate change.

The findings of this report are stark.

Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, banks have injected a staggering $3.23 trillion into financing fossil fuel operations in the Global South, comprising almost US$870 billion in loans and US$2.4 billion in underwriting. Furthermore, these institutions have allocated $1.1 trillion toward financing industrial agriculture in the Global South, exacerbating the climate crisis and disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities in these regions.

Hence, the message from ActionAid Climate Justice Campaign is unequivocal.

" Banks must immediately cease financing fossil fuels and industrial agriculture, redirecting their resources toward sustainable solutions. The global community cannot idly tolerate the role of financial institutions in environmental degradation; so, it is imperative that they shoulder their responsibility in the fight against climate change," says the message.

Moreover, the report underscores the role of public finance in perpetuating these issues. Governments in the Global South have channeled $1.4 trillion in subsidies to fossil fuels and $500 billion to industrial agriculture. This gross misallocation of public funds must cease, with governments redirecting these subsidies toward sustainable solutions that benefit both the environment and their citizens.

Funding fossil fuel and industrial agriculture intensifies climate change by emitting greenhouse gases, causing climate-related hazards warming, and triggering severe environmental consequences like extreme weather, rising sea levels, and ecosystem disruptions.

Industrial agriculture exacerbates the climate change issue through deforestation, excessive water use, carbon dioxide and methane emissions, and soil and water pollution from synthetic inputs.

"Transitioning to renewable energy and sustainable farming practices is crucial to address these challenges and ensure a healthier, more sustainable future for the planet," ActionAid recommends.

Amidst these challenges, ActionAid Rwanda continues to promote and pursue innovative solutions to mitigate climate risks like commitment to renewable energy sources, including hydroelectric power, solar energy, methane gas, etc.

Simultaneously, ActionAid Rwanda advocates for agroecology to promote sustainable agricultural practices that prioritize soil health, organic farming, and biodiversity preservation as well as reforestation initiatives to improve carbon sequestration capacity, establishing carbon sinks that offset emissions, among others.

During the Africa Heads of States Summit on Climate Change in Nairobi held from September 4 to 6, 2023, leaders underscored the critical need for a global partnership to combat climate change.

Recognizing the interconnectedness of this issue that transcends borders, the summit underscored the importance of collaborative efforts among nations to mitigate the impacts of climate change and secure a sustainable future for the African continent and the world.

Beyond these commitments, and adding to ActionAid advocacy efforts there is a pressing need for a global movement to reallocate financial resources from harmful activities to sustainable solutions.

This movement is essential not only for advocating for addressing the climate crisis but also for building a more just and equitable future. By advocating for change collectively and holding financial institutions and governments accountable, we can usher in a new era of climate justice and environmental responsibility.

ActionAid urges major international banks to cease financing fossil fuels and industrial agriculture in the Global South as it exacerbates the climate crisis and disproportionately harms vulnerable communities. We call on Governments in the Global South to redirect subsidies away from harmful industries and toward sustainable solutions.

"Join us in this vital endeavor! Climate change threatens human rights globally by disrupting access to essentials like clean water and food, especially for marginalized communities. It worsens inequalities, particularly affecting disadvantaged populations, endangering rights to life, health, and livelihoods, and even undermining political stability," ActionAid calls.

HD 	AU to Join G20 As India Boosts Global South

By helping the African Union earn a seat at the G20 table, India has emerged as a champion of the Global South. The announcement that the AU will join the G20 comes as India and China are competing for greater influence.

The Group of 20 granted permanent membership to the African Union at its summit in New Delhi on Saturday.

TD 
	

"This will strengthen the G20 and also strengthen the voice of the Global South," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his remarks, which were also posted to social media.

With 55 member states -- six of which are currently suspended because they are under the rule of juntas -- the AU has become the second regional organization to join the G20, after the European Union. "This membership, for which we have long been advocating, will provide a propitious framework for amplifying advocacy in favor of the Continent and its effective contribution to meeting global challenges," AU Commission head Moussa Faki Mahamat wrote on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

Since India assumed the rotating presidency of the G20 in December, Modi's government has pushed for international consensus on issues that affect developing nations.

"One of the points India has also been making with its presidency is that, at a time when multilateral institutions across the board are not working effectively, the G20 with a mix of the developing and developed world is at a better position to articulate global governance issues," Harsh Pant, the vice president of studies and foreign policy at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, told DW. "While G7 represents an older order, G20 represents a new global order where new voices are rising, and new actors are making their presence felt."

'More African voices'

The African continent is home to about 17% of the world's population. However, until Saturday South Africa had been the only G20 member from the region.

"The idea is to bring more African voices to the table, instead of them being the recipients of decisions, norms and rules by countries and institutions that are far more advanced," Sreeram Chaulia, a professor and dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs at India's O.P. Jindal Global University, told DW. "It will also help unify African countries if they have a voice through the African Union."

Back in December, US President Joe Biden said G20 membership for the African Union had "been a long time in coming." At its summit in February, the AU formally declared its intent to become a permanent member of the G20. Modi expressed his support for AU membership during the Business 20 summit in August.

Though there was widespread support for the African Union from G20 members, there was also some initial reticence among countries such as Australia and Indonesia.

The approval is seen by some experts as a victory for Indian diplomacy.

"During the pandemic, the developed world was busy using vaccines for their own people while African countries were ignored," Rajiv Bhatia, the former Indian ambassador to Mexico and Myanmar and a distinguished fellow at the Gateway House think tank, told DW. "This is when nations such as India came forward to help them. When the Ukraine conflict happened, the developing world suffered due to the shortage of food, fuel and fertilizers. Keeping all this in mind and considering the heavy burden of debt that developing countries have to carry, India is pushing all these issues into the mainstream G20 agenda."

India, China compete

China is the largest trading partner for the African continent overall and the fourth-biggest source of international investment. Bilateral trade between China and Africa stood at about $282 billion in 2022, whereas trade between India and Africa stood at nearly $98 billion in 2022-23 according to government data from Beijing and New Delhi, respectively.

"There is a degree of competition for influence in Africa -- not only between India and China, but also other partners operating in the region such as the US, EU, Brazil, Turkey, UAE, Japan, Indonesia and so on," Bhatia said.

In August, the BRICS grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa announced that it would welcome six new members -- including Ethiopia and Egypt from the African continent.

International observers say officials from the US and EU would prefer to see India emerge as the more prominent ally of emerging economies.

"China today stands in opposition to the West, whereas India sees itself as a bridge," Pants said. "It doesn't see itself or its priorities as antagonistic to the West. India's idea of global governance is to bring together the developed and developing world to face common challenges. India provides an alternative to China, which a lot of developing countries are more comfortable with."

Beijing was supportive of the decision to admit the African Union to the G20 and the joint declaration at the summit. However, in a commentary posted online Saturday, the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations think tank criticized India for having "created divisions and rivalries in the G20" and hosting the Global Voice of the South online summit earlier this year without inviting China. The CICIR accused India of "using its presidency of the G20 to act as a spokesperson for the Global South."

African Union on Saturday joined the Group of Twenty (G-20) at the ongoing summit in New Delhi India.

"Advancing a more inclusive G20 that echoes the aspirations of the Global South! PM Narendra Modi extends a heartfelt welcome to President African Union and the President of Comoros Azali Assoumani. Thrilled to have the African Union as a permanent member. A milestone for the G20 family indeed," the Office of the Prime Minister of India said in a post on the social networking platform X.

Mr Modi said AU membership will strengthen the G20 and also strengthen the voice of the Global South. A position India has touted since assuming the G20 presidency.

AU chairperson, Moussa Faki, welcoming AU's membership of the G20, said, " This membership, for which we have long been advocating, will provide a propitious framework for amplifying advocacy in favour of the Continent and its effective contribution to meeting global challenges."

India took over the presidency of the G20 in December 2022. The G20 is a group of 19 countries and the European Union whose focus is global economics and development.

The G20 was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis as a forum for Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to discuss global economic and financial issues.

The G20 was upgraded to the level of Heads of State/Government in the wake of the global economic and financial crisis of 2007, and, in 2009, was designated the "premier forum for international economic cooperation".

The G20 Summit is held annually, under the leadership of a rotating presidency. The G20 initially focused largely on broad macroeconomic issues, but it has since expanded its agenda to include trade, climate change, sustainable development, health, agriculture, energy, environment, climate change, and anti-corruption.

Will an expanded BRICS precipitate a new international order, or collapse under the weight of its internal contradictions?

The words of 13th century Persian poet Jalāl al-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī, 'As you start to walk the way, the way appears,' certainly found new resonance in Johannesburg last week at the 15th BRICS Summit.

TD 
	

Apart from expanding the diplomatic club to include Iran, Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the summit revealed the global south's growing disillusionment with the current structure of the international system.

These frustrations have bolstered BRICS' appeal as a counterweight to leading Western countries, such as those composing the G7. More significantly, an expanded BRICS represents a resounding call for international reform by global south states, exclusive from, and in opposition to, traditional Western powers.

This unprecedented moment reflects the shifting locus of global power, and has propelled an expanded BRICS to chart a way into unknown territory.

Decisions over the nature and trajectory of global order were once the sole preserve of the European 'great' powers, along with the United States (US). The contemporary international system will undoubtedly be shaped by the Asia-Pacific region, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

If global institutions fail to evolve, international cooperation on pressing issues will inevitably fail

If global institutions fail to evolve and accommodate this reality, international cooperation on the most pressing issues of our time will inevitably fail. On paper, this is the fundamental challenge BRICS intends to address in order to bring about a more 'representative, fairer international order, [and] a reformed multilateral system.'

How it does so, however, remains poorly defined.

One likely approach is to use the group's combined economic clout to pursue global governance, financial and justice system reform, and alternative paths on specific issues like climate change.

Already, the current BRICS states' collective economic output (based on GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity) is roughly US$3 trillion larger than the G7, which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and United Kingdom. (As a non-enumerated member, the European Union is excluded.)

With six new BRICS members in 2024, this difference rises to just under US$11 trillion. However, economic output measured by GDP based on current exchange rates places the G7 as the larger combined economy (even with the six new BRICS members).

Coordinated action on points of contention may not be as easy for BRICS as for the G7

Regardless, countries in the global south are increasingly poised to challenge the economic dominance of traditional powers. And based on the former's current growth trajectories, will decisively outperform the G7 economies over the coming decades.

This combined economic influence could help to secure greater representation and fairer rules and procedures in the United Nations Security Council, International Criminal Court, World Bank and International Monetary Fund - among others alluded to in the BRICS Johannesburg II Declaration.

However, coordinating common action on specific points of contention may not be as easy for the expanded BRICS grouping as for the G7.

G7 countries have structured their cooperation on global matters around shared liberal political values and norms, particularly on democracy and civil liberties. While these have been threatened in recent years by the rise of populist right-wing administrations, G7 members' considerable normative and political alignment underpins their global economic clout.

The expanded BRICS grouping, on the other hand, is a more arbitrary constellation of states with very different (and sometimes diametrically opposed) political systems and values. They range from progressive constitutional democracies to closed and repressive theocracies, to countries experimenting with hybrid authoritarianism.

Ironically, BRICS may be in its ascendency due to its ambiguity and loosely articulated vision

An analysis of various governance variables across member countries, including perceptions of political stability, rule of law, government effectiveness and basic freedoms, reveals a high level of variance. Scores for each of these variables show a standard deviation from the mean that is often more than double that of G7 countries.

That raises serious questions about BRICS' ability to pursue coherent, coordinated action on global institutional reform, despite members agreeing that the international system is unfairly structured. Without a robust normative basis for cooperation, disagreements over issues such as gender equality, individual rights and liberties, and the character of a new international order, could derail momentum needed for meaningful change.

Ironically, BRICS may well be in its ascendency due to its ambiguity and loosely articulated vision of multipolarity and a reformed international system. However, as the group expands and evolves into something more concrete, difficult issues may not be as easy to kick down the road as before.

For example, how do all members justify provisions in the Johannesburg II Declaration on respecting international humanitarian law in conflict situations, increased participation of women in peace processes, and the promotion and protection of democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all?

Squaring these provisions with the brazen violations by certain current and incoming BRICS members will test the mettle of the diplomatic club. These contradictions must be overcome for BRICS to muster not only its economic clout, but the moral and political capital to pursue reforms and serve as a counterweight to the G7.

Rumi's wisdom still rings true, but as the expanded BRICS group marches towards a new world order, the way ahead may be murkier than initially expected.

Despite divisions among the BRICS members, there is an emerging consensus that the international order is not working and a new one is needed.

The leaders of the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) are gathering in Johannesburg this week in what is likely to be pivotal meeting for the bloc's trajectory. Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be attending due to an International Criminal Court warrant. But Moscow and Beijing will be pushing for the group's expansion in a bid to strengthen the bloc as an alternative to the U.S.-led liberal international order. Over 40 countries have applied to join. But there is division within the five members. Brazil and India fear that expansion will dilute their influence and impact their nonaligned foreign policies. China and Russia, on the other hand, would like to position BRICS as a counterweight to the Group of 7 (G7) and other Western-led alignments.

TD 
	

Although not formally on the agenda of the summit, "de-dollarization" is a priority issue for many BRICS countries and the dozens of other states in attendance. Some have suggested that BRICS establish its own currency to curb dependence on the U.S. dollar -- but most observers see that as unviable. What is more likely is that BRICS countries and other partners will continue the trend of trading in their own local currencies instead of using the dollar. The BRICS bank already lends in Chinese yuan and announced yesterday that it would also do so in South African and Brazilian currencies.

USIP's Andrew Cheatham and Adam Gallagher explain why this summit is important, what an expansion of the bloc would mean for its future and what this all means for the United States.

Why is this BRICS summit important and how does it figure into major geopolitical trends?

Cheatham: Many around the world have their eyes on the ongoing BRICS summit in Johannesburg, in part because together the BRICS nations encompass a population of 3.5 billion, accounting for a substantial segment of global emerging markets. Originally the countries came together as a grouping in the late 2000s to coalesce around issues of finance, development and trade. However, the bloc has now grown to symbolize one side of the ledger in a world of bitter strategic rivalry and growing multipolarity.

In this narrative, the G7 advanced economies -- Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States (and the European Union) -- are on the opposing side. Although Brazil has taken issue with this anti-Western framing, great attention to the BRICS around the world has helped China and Russia's rhetorical campaign to pin "the West" against "the rest." With Russia's illegal war of aggression raging in Ukraine and escalating tensions between China and the United States, countries are increasingly called on to take positions siding with one camp or the other.

This is not, however, a repeat of the Cold War. So-called "middle powers" have a much greater share of overall global influence in today's international politics. The BRICS are often seen as a key space for such powers, particularly non-Western states in the Global South.

BRICS expansion is one of the big themes of the summit. What would the group's expansion signal about its trajectory?

Cheatham: Over 40 countries have requested to join the BRICS. With membership, countries are likely to enjoy a special relationship with the members of New Development Bank, which was founded by the BRICS nations and provides financing for many states searching for alternatives to the Western-dominated Paris Club. Additionally, many prospective members are hoping to have influence within a rising coalition of non-Western states with ambitions to reshape the global order.

For almost 80 years the conventional pathway for affecting change and progress in the international system was through the multilateral institutions themselves. Today, however, we are seeing a new wave of "minilateralism" -- a style of diplomatic engagement that gives prominence to small- and medium-sized coalitions of like-minded states. This trend, which is on the rise in the West as well, will be exacerbated by the expansion of the BRICS.

One problem with minilateralism is that it threatens to further erode our means of global collective action needed to tackle the massive threats posed to humanity today. The extreme weather events witnessed recently highlight the critical balance between economic concerns and the pressing need for energy transitions to address climate change.

But climate change is just one of many pressing issues. The rise of disruptive technologies -- especially the widespread adoption of groundbreaking weapons technologies like bio-weapons by non-state entities -- is particularly alarming. The popularity of the Oppenheimer film should remind us all of the perennial nuclear threats -- now increased by the precarious state of nuclear arms control. Additionally, the ongoing challenges of diseases like COVID-19 underscore the ever-present risk of lethal pandemics. These represent just a fraction of the existential dangers that mandate global collaboration. If the world fragments into antagonistic small to medium blocs, our collective ability to address these threats might be compromised.

Gallagher: The debate over BRICS expansion reveals how divided the bloc really is -- it also demonstrates structural issues that make the development of a common currency unlikely.

As U.S.-China competition has ramped up over the last decade, Beijing has increasingly sought to position itself as the leader of an emerging multipolar world. Its Global Security Initiative, launched last year by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, is an attempt to fashion a new global security order that Beijing says is more capable of addressing intractable peace and conflict challenges than the Western-led system. With BRICS already accounting for 40 percent of the world's population and a quarter of global GDP, adding to the bloc means that BRICS would be stronger and more influential group, further advancing multipolarity.

For its part, Moscow is also keen on advancing a multipolar world and see BRICS expansion has a way to undermine the liberal international order. Isolated by the West following its illegal invasion of Ukraine, Russia has looked to the Global South to help keep its economy afloat. So, a bigger BRICS helps insulate Moscow from Western sanctions and opprobrium. And the attendance of dozens of countries at the summit will be seen by Moscow as a positive signal regarding its international standing.

South Africa has also been a proponent of BRICS expansion. Ahead of the summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that he wants to see more African countries join and partner with the bloc and he invited over 30 African leaders to participate in this week's summit.

India and Brazil see it a bit differently. Although the seventh largest country in the world in population, Brazil does not have the diplomatic weight of Russia or China and believes that BRICS expansion would diminish its influence in the bloc and as a leader of the Global South.

India is wary of the bloc becoming overtly anti-Western in orientation. One of the founding nations of the nonaligned movement during the Cold War, India has carried this legacy on amid today's great power competition. While it is a member of the BRICS grouping and the China-Russia founded Shanghai Cooperation Organization, New Delhi's relationship with the United States has reached new heights in recent years and it is a member of the Quad (along with Japan, Australia and the United States), a not so subtle effort to compete with China in the Indo-Pacific. Indeed, countering Chinese aggression and influence in India's backyard is the "bedrock" of U.S.-India cooperation, according to USIP South Asia expert Daniel Markey.

Over 40 countries -- including Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Argentina, Indonesia, Nigeria and Ethiopia -- have applied to join. Many of these middle powers are also frustrated by the liberal international order and chafe at what they perceive as U.S. hegemony, with U.S. and Western sanctions high on the list of irritants. For them, BRICS presents an alternative.

One straightforward way the admission of any of these countries' admission would impact BRICS is in its decision-making. BRICS operates by consensus. Adding more members means that consensus will be more difficult to reach, as each country has its own interests, priorities and relationships.

What countries join could also be critical in the trajectory of the BRICS. Will it evolve into the type of anti-Western bloc China and Russia seek? Iran, for example, would be more than happy to follow China's and Russia's lead in advancing an alternative to the U.S.-led order. But a country like Saudi Arabia -- despite the many troubles in its relationship with Washington -- is likely less inclined toward such an orientation, as it prizes its security ties with the United States.

Why does this matter for the United States?

Cheatham: In strategizing for short-, medium- and long-term national security concerns, the United States must closely monitor the BRICS evolution. While the ever-expanding competition with China will remain central to U.S. foreign policy, understanding the growing relative influence and potential choke points maintained by other key powers is also critical. Fostering robust engagements with friends like India and South Africa is paramount -- even as the latter shows a closer affiliation with Russia. Such partnerships can serve as counterbalances, ensuring that the BRICS trajectory does not veer toward an anti-Western alignment. However, this shouldn't tempt Washington to excessively lean into minilateral diplomacy at the detriment of multilateral efforts. Engaging even with adversaries in larger platforms is imperative to collaboratively address the monumental challenges of our era.

Gallagher: This BRICS summit comes amid a tumultuous, almost entropic period in international politics. Intensifying U.S.-China competition and Russia's illegal war on Ukraine have accentuated geopolitical trendlines. If there's a big takeaway for Washington, it should be that many countries, including traditional partners, are frustrated by the liberal international order and unsatisfied with post-Cold War unipolarity. The post-World War II system the United States designed and led has seen one of the most enduring periods of global peace and prosperity in modern history. But nothing lasts forever. The United States should take these concerns seriously and consider how to remake, or at least amend, the current multilateral order to address these frustrations and concerns, working with allies and partners to tackle the major challenges of the day. If not, other powers will step in, likely in ways that do not advance U.S. interests.

The response to the HIV epidemic is more than 40 years old. The African continent has been the most affected with millions of people over the years having battled HIV-associated opportunistic infections and subsequent deaths, leaving millions of orphans and decimated communities and economies. By 1996, the scientific evidence was clear - combination highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) prolonged and improved the quality of life of people living with HIV (PLWH).

In 1998, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) released its first HIV treatment guidelines, changing the course of the HIV epidemic, but only for communities with access to ART. Despite these advances, Africans were amongst the last to benefit from lifesaving ART, largely because of cost and many people in the north believing that it was not possible for African health systems to provide drugs to their people - as reported in the New York Times in 2001.

TD 
	

Shouldering the HIV burden

According to UNAIDS, of the 39 million people estimated to be living with HIV globally, 20.8 million live in eastern and southern Africa with a further 4.8 million in western and central Africa. This means that more than 65% of the global burden is in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, of the 1.3 million new HIV infections in 2022, UNAIDS reports that 660 000 were in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. With respect to treatment, 83% of PLWH in eastern and southern Africa are on ART, 78% in western and central Africa but only 50% of those in the Middle East and North Africa (compared to 76% globally). In addition, the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is heterogenous when compared to the epidemic in the US or Europe. HIV remains more prevalent amongst women than men, with heterosexual rather than homosexual encounters accounting for majority of HIV transmission, with higher rates of HIV and risk of new infections amongst female sex workers and their clients, and ongoing HIV transmission amongst pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV to their children.

A disenfranchised global south

Given that the challenges presented by the evolving HIV epidemic and the public health response are mostly experienced in Africa, it has recently been asked why are most of the conferences on HIV held in the north. This approach prioritises researchers and other stakeholders from the north attending and presenting their research, most of which is conducted in Africa. This disenfranchises global south researchers and stakeholders who have limited funding and enormous visa entry challenges with attending such conferences and participating in discussions and debates.

Good to see IAS learn from the Montréal debacle that saw many activists and leaders from the Global South excluded from the AIDS 2022 conference due to visa issues.

Continental rotation of conferences is at least one positive step to addressing this... https://t.co/dPp3sWhvuJ

An African-led HIV response

To address these inequities and propel African voices and perspectives in the next phase of the HIV response in Africa, a group of Africans approached the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to fund the establishment of an African-led HIV control working group (HCWG) of experts from the continent to come together as a working group to develop consensus perspectives on the definition of long-term sustained control of HIV and prioritise the systems and capabilities to achieve it. The HCWG is currently co-chaired by Dr Izukanji Sikazwe and Dr Yogan Pillay. Its members have expertise in a wide range of topics from epidemiology, clinical aspects of HIV, financing, and economics, lived experiences with HIV, advocates, and policy makers.

The vision of the HCWG is an "African-led response for long-term HIV control on the continent" and its mission is "finding sustainable solutions to end HIV as a public health threat in Africa led by African stakeholders, in partnership and solidarity with the global community".

The specific objectives of the project are to establish an HIV Control Working Group (HCWG) comprising African experts and to, through this, develop consensus perspectives on the definition of long-term sustained HIV control, the systems and capabilities required to achieve it, and the long-term sustainability of the HIV response by Africans. It also aims to offer recommendations to funders, African governments, and implementing partners.

The intended outcomes of this work include an effective African-led HCWG that contributes to the acceleration and coordination of African stakeholders' HIV response with a consolidated and coherent approach; a framework for reducing HIV as a public health threat and reprioritisation of HIV prevention; a platform to promote African governments' ownership of the HIV response; recommendations that impact policy formulation, HIV control, and sustainability.

Independent and collaborative

The working group will be independent and not aligned with any funder, government, or institution, and will represent African voices. Apart from its independence, its membership, which is representative of expert African technocrats and advocates, will work collaboratively with African government leadership, policy bodies, and funders to influence policies and practices toward a sustained response. The working group will proactively engage with a consultive group that is constituted of members drawn from the African Union, WHO, The Global Fund, PEPFAR, Africa CDC, UN Agencies, African Development Bank, funders, and community stakeholders.

The working group was convened for the first time on 10 August. The thematic areas that the HCWG will prioritise are broadly categorised into the following areas: Defining HIV control from an African perspective; governance and leadership to promote country-led HIV responses; HIV prevention; and health systems strengthening, including community systems. This effort will complement other efforts to mobilise African leaders to take greater responsibility for the response to HIV and AIDS, including the recently held meeting of African Ministers of Finance.

*Dr Pillay is the Director of HIV and TB Delivery at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Dr Sikazwe is the CEO of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia.

HD 	How Russia Is Fighting for Allies Among the Brics Countries Using 'Memory Diplomacy'

Since the start of the Ukraine war, there have been numerous diplomatic visits by Russian officials to Africa and Latin America aiming at boosting Russia's global influence.

TD 
	

In 2023 Russian officials visited Angola, Burundi, Eritrea, Eswatini, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, South Africa and Sudan. In the same year, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov toured some areas of Latin America visiting Brazil, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. The objective was to deepen ties and increase the support for Russia's war in Ukraine.

As the Ukrainian war goes on, some observers have noted that Russia is trying to gather influential support for its position in the war. Its claims to be fighting against the west's power and neo-colonialism appear to have won some supporters. Ukraine's attempts to win allies in the same regions by arguing that it is fighting off an empire don't appear to have resonated so well.

Some observers argue that we are witnessing the "return of the global Russia" through economic and political influence, and through its use of digital disinformation techniques to distribute narratives. In the 2010s, the expansion of Russia's influence in Africa was the result of economic "opportunism", but during the Ukraine war, it has become more strategic. There is evidence that in some African countries the influence of Russia continues to intensify. South Africa, for instance, seems to be moving away from the west and steering towards China's and Russia's orbit.

But this could partly be because a challenge to the current liberal order is likely to be beneficial for the global south, giving it more power to negotiate in the international arena and achieve some of its policy targets. This was hinted at the recent Brics conference meeting of senior leaders from Russia, China, Brazil, India and South Africa. The leaders of these expanding economies are therefore hesitant to fully condemn Russia for its actions in Ukraine.

At the summit, Brazil's president Lula da Silva said the Ukraine war "showed the limitations of the UN security council", and pointed to the economic power of the Brics allies as a symbol of its global relevance. The recent decision to integrate six new countries (including Argentina, Iran and UAE) into the bloc will increase that relevance and could enable its members to influence the current world order.

The strategic value of nostalgia

Two interrelated factors can help us understand Russia's attractiveness to the global south, and reluctance to fully support Ukraine. First, Russia frames itself as an "anti-colonial" agent, particularly in Africa. Such a strategy is based on "memory diplomacy", aimed at increasing its influence overseas by taking advantage of shared positive memories.

Memory diplomacy, for instance, invokes Russia's contribution to the victory against fascism during the second world war. In addition, it points out that Russia has never colonised an African country and that it did not participate in the slave trade. On the contrary, the argument goes, Russia, as the centre of the Soviet Union, supported different anti-colonial struggles in the region during the cold war, for example, in Angola and Mozambique.

Another factor in understanding Russia's appeal to the global south is the "legacy" of Moscow's solidarity with various countries in the past.

Read more: Africa is being courted by China, Russia and the US. Why the continent shouldn't pick sides

In 1927, the Communist International, an international organisation supportive of world communism that was led by the Soviet Union, sponsored the League Against Imperialism. The league aimed to eliminate colonial rule in the world. It brought together leading anti-colonial activists from around the world and prominent people such as Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi.

Ultimately, the league became an inspiration for many of the leaders of the global south's decolonisation struggles. In this sense, it has left a long-term legacy in the countries where Moscow's support had an effect on their anti-colonial struggles.

This is evident in the case of South Africa. Its position towards the war in Ukraine is arguably partly defined by a nostalgia relating to Moscow's support for its struggle against apartheid combined with a distrust for the west's policies. The criticism levelled at the west in the global south by leaders such as Brazil's Lula is that it upholds democracy at home while being willing to violate democratic principles elsewhere if the advancement of its interests makes it advantageous.

Challenging nostalgia

Ukraine has responded to Russia's diplomatic actions by increasing its embassies in Africa and prioritising the global south as a foreign policy. But this "battle" front may be more difficult than it seems.

Russia continues to advance narratives, usually via its expertise in the use of digital channels, that strengthen its geopolitical influence. In addition, for the global south, Russia is perceived as a counterbalance to the west - particularly the US. And importantly, what can Ukraine offer to the global south?

Ukraine could gather further support from Brics countries by strengthening existing economic ties and pointing out shared problems caused by Russia. Building the proposed new grain hubs for storing crops, such as wheat and corn, is a good start. This is particularly important because of Russia's decision to withdraw permission for Ukrainian ships carrying grain to leave Black Sea ports. This is likely to cause food shortages across Africa. The Kenyan government, for instance, denounced Russia's decision as a "stab in the back" for African countries.

Ukraine could also tap into the similarities of its national struggle and those of the global south's anti-colonial experiences. Rather than focusing its narrative against Russia, it could begin to build shared "memories" with the global south by concentrating on the commonalities of victimhood.

What is becoming increasingly clear is that any country that attempts to challenge the image of Russia as an anti-imperialist agent, is in for a long battle. Particularly, if those countries cannot effectively appeal to their own shared positive memories.

Johannesburg delivered a level of drama befitting of the occasion. But beyond the shared desire for reformed global economic governance, it's unclear how the expanded group will benefit South African citizens.

South Africa's Police Minister, Bheki Cele, compared hosting BRICS to the World Cup in 2010 - perhaps the last time the country felt like it was the centre of the world's attention. Fighter jets screamed over the city at regular intervals as if to remind its residents that important matters were taking place.

TD 
	

The message that BRICS represents 40 per cent of the world's population and a growing share of its GDP was echoed across marketing banners at the airport and venue, and across media. These statistics seem to serve as the central justification for why the group exists, and why South Africa would want to be a part of it.

But despite the fanfare and the impressive potential of the economies involved, BRICS membership still delivers few specific economic benefits for South Africa, remaining primarily a forum for its geopolitical ambition.

And in a newly-expanded BRICS, South Africa will need to work with new partners and engage in 'group diplomacy' to ensure its position is strengthened and not diluted.

A desire for a multipolar world

BRICS week began with a Sunday night public address by President Cyril Ramaphosa, rooting South Africa's foreign policy in the struggle against apartheid and a push for equal national recognition on the world stage.

In South Africa there is a historically justifiable deep scepticism of Western dominance of the global economic architecture

In South Africa there is a historically justifiable deep scepticism of Western dominance of the global economic architecture and a pragmatic desire to engage with a variety of partners in a multipolar world.

The economic repercussions of working with Russia, created by Western trade and investment partners, has prompted anger and accusations of bullying.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for President Putin also cast an unwelcome shadow over the run up to the event, as speculation mounted over South Africa's obligations should the Russian leader attend. (In the end he did not, by 'mutual agreement').

Despite these difficulties, the country has made a serious, if occasionally recalcitrant, effort to reinforce its close relations with the EU, US, and Western multilateral bodies.

BRICS is integral to South Africa's foreign policy, helping it counterbalance relations with the West. It views the grouping as a means for collective lobbying for a more equitable international economic system, and to champion the needs and concerns of the Global South.

BRICS trade

The economic benefits of membership, however, remain unclear. South Africa is home to the first regional office of the New Development Bank (Formerly the BRICS Development Bank), but aside from this it is hard to pinpoint benefits that have been accrued by group membership.

It is true that trade between members has increased over the last 20 years. But this can be largely accredited simply to their rapid economic growth, especially of China, rather than any specific BRICS mechanism.

A secondary driver of intra-BRICS trade has been Russia's increasing reliance on trade with China and India in the wake of Western economic sanctions.

China accounts for 68 per cent of South Africa's BRICS trade - its top international trade partner overall, closely followed by the USA.

China accounts for 68 per cent of South Africa's BRICS trade - its top international trade partner overall, closely followed by the USA.

President Xi Jinping arrived in South Africa early for a state visit ahead of the summit, and President Ramaphosa announced that in their private discussions the Chinese had donated R167 million in emergency power equipment and made available a grant of about R500 million as developmental assistance on energy.

Further agreements were fleshed out on the sidelines of the main summit, but the announcement served to underline the point that important matters are resolved bilaterally, not through BRICS.

Continuing division and expanded membership

Partly this is a result of the realpolitik of BRICS. Lingering geopolitical rivalries still make it difficult to act as a cohesive group, an issue illustrated by the theatrics of the occasion.

President Ramaphosa greeted President Xi Jinping off the plane when he arrived for his state visit. It was reported that India's president, Narendra Modi, refused to disembark when a minister was sent to greet him, instead holding out until South Africa's deputy president made his way to the airport.

Deeper divisions exist on a path forward on economic integration. Russia had been pushing for discussion of a BRICS currency, feeling the impediment of US sanctions. There is a shared desire for a less dollar-reliant world.

And the summit resolved to task finance ministers and central bank governors to consider the issue of local currencies, payment instruments and platforms and report back to the BRICS leaders by the next summit, to be held in Russia.

Moscow may find allies on this issue in Tehran. South Africa has made it clear it sees a unified currency as economically unfeasible.

This summit will mainly be remembered for President Ramaphosa's announcement that BRICS membership will be expanded

This summit will mainly be remembered for President Ramaphosa's announcement that BRICS membership will be expanded - a significant move that will test the diplomatic capabilities of South Africa.

Emerging economies are keen to be part of the group that shares a desire for non-Western multilateralism. After receiving applications from 23 prospective members, six additional countries will join the BRICS starting from 2024, ushering in the era of 'BRICS 3.0'. (BRICS 2.0 being the inclusion of South Africa in 2010).

South Africa has benefitted from being a small player in the club. Expanded membership will dilute its position - not least the inclusion of Ethiopia and Egypt as additional African members.

It could also serve as an opportunity. South Africa doesn't want to be reliant on Beijing any more than Washington, and new members will give the government fresh options within the new framework: to engage in 'club diplomacy', push for reform of the global economic architecture, and amplify the voice of the Global South.

South Africa's leaders will hold up the BRICS summit as a symbol of success for Global South multilateralism.

South Africa's leaders will hold up the BRICS summit as a symbol of success for Global South multilateralism. Its ambitions will continue in 2025 when it will host the G20, which will also celebrate expanding membership with the inclusion of the African Union.

Thirty years after it emerged from international isolation, South Africa prioritizes being part of the club, even if the benefits of membership remain unclear.

The Vice President, Kashim Shettima, says Nigeria remains committed to collaborating with China and African countries to ensure that the objectives of the partnership are achieved for the benefit of both parties.

Mr Olusola Abiola, Director, Information, Office of the Vice President, in a statement on Friday, said Shettima stated this at the China-Africa Leaders' Roundtable Dialogue Meeting on the margins of the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa.

TD 
	

Shettima spoke to a large audience at the Sandton Convention Centre, including President Xi Jinping of China, and some African leaders on the theme, "Promoting African Integration and Jointly Building a High-Level Africa-China Community with a Shared Future".

He said "Nigeria welcomes the new initiatives introduced by the Chinese authorities, which include supporting and promoting the modernization of Africa's agriculture and agribusiness sectors.

"It also supports the provision of robust support for Africa to expedite regional integration and backing Africa's industrialization and infrastructure expansion."

He commended the existing partnership between China and Africa, particularly "the three newly-identified initiatives and priority areas of cooperation between China and Africa in the areas of agriculture, industrialisation, and human capacity development.

"These align with the 'Renewed Hope' mantra of the President Bola Tinubu's Administration, the African Union's Agenda 2063, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2030.

"They are relevant to our continental and national development aspirations," the vice president said.

Shettima, who praised the commitment of China, added that Nigeria firmly endorses China and anticipates forging a close collaboration with the Chinese authorities, the African Union, and all other stakeholders.

"This collective efforts will elevate the Africa-China comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership to unprecedented heights, driven by our mutual pursuit of economic prosperity."

He identified critical areas for the prevailing partnership between Africa and China to include; fostering synergy among the pertinent national institutions tasked with formulating, coordinating, and implementing national policies in the three priority areas of cooperation; and encourage efforts that promote African ownership of these initiatives.

"Other areas include the new undertakings designed in a manner that acknowledges that local percularities are community-based, and tailors to individual country needs.

"Amplify international resources for financing education in Africa; Solicit input from pertinent African Union institutions and continental organizations such as the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, and other related regional bodies."

Shettima also stressed the importance of financing Africa's Infrastructure, with a focus on advancing key infrastructural components like Farm-to-Market Corridors, Farm-to-Ports Corridors, Export Transport Corridors, Railway Networks and Road Network Upgrades.

"Also, expansions, Airport Enhancements, including dedicated export-oriented airports, Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution, are important."

On Nigeria's relationship with the global south, Shettima told his audience that Nigeria prioritises its relations with the Global South and deeply values all aspects of the South-South Cooperation.

The vice president noted that the global South is currently grappling with unparalleled challenges, and we are compelled to devise solutions for climate change and establish security measures to contain and prevent transnational crime, terrorism, and cyberattacks.

"We are confronted with a significant rate of youth unemployment and disruptive natural disasters. This situation provides us with the chance to reassess the challenges we collectively face, as well as those confronting our partners."

In his address, the President of China and co-chair of the Dialogue, Xi Jinping, assured the African leaders that China would launch initiatives to support Africa's industrialisation and agricultural modernisation.

Shettima was accompanied to the event by Nigeria's High Commissioner to South Africa, Amb. Muhammad Manta, the Consul-General, Amb. Andrew Idi, and other senior government officials.

Nearly a decade and half, the BRICS platform has become a consequential and formidable multilateral international mechanism, shaping the emerging trend of inclusive global governance. Since after its first summit in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in 2009, the mechanism has phenomenally grown in consolidating its internal consultative frame work and has extended its outreach activities through the "BRICS plus" effects.

Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are heavy weights in their own respective rights but seized the opportunity and moment of their outstanding performances as significant emerging economies to evolve, shape and consolidate on international mechanism not only to enhance cooperation among themselves but sought to invest the trend of globalisation with the practice of multilateralism and opening new vista for inclusive and participatory global governance.

TD 
	

The opportunities of broad economic and financial inclusion, featuring market access, investments and a trend, away from a dominant single international currency offers countries in Africa, a crucial entry point to the global economy with robust prospects of integration to the international value chain. The trend of evolving an inclusive international financial architecture featuring diverse payment systems, to range from barter exchanges to the use of multiple currencies offer African countries a way out of the persistent conundrum of being tied to a settlement arrangement through a single dominant currency, they have no decision at all of its trajectories.

The early optimism about the BRICS, when they were just modelled as the emerging and hopeful economies of the 21st century has proved self-fulfilling. Just about a year ago, BRICS countries over took the G7, advanced Western capitalist economies in the global GDP contribution to the world economy, accounting for 1/3 of worldwide economic activities.The economies of the various countries in Africa have largely been constrained by the traditional structure of the global economy in which they are mostly limited to the market share of commodities.

This nature of the global economy has imposed a structural constraint, in which the economies of African countries became largely mono-cultural and dominated by single or a set of commodities without the benefit of the multiplying effects of value addition. This has considerably constrained industrial capacity in the region and stalled any meaningful efforts in economic diversification. BRICS membership or out-reach of Africa would not be a magic wand to wave off, decades of structural distortion and disarticulation of economies in the region fostered by the unequal relationship and exchange with the global North, but would provide the impetus and enable the conducive facility to shake off the structural gridlock that has mostly shackled these countries despite their best efforts. The openness and inclusiveness of the BRICS framework would provide the objective conditions for African countries to recalibrate and retool their economic outlook to benefit from the reciprocal economic intercourse that is at the heart of the BRICS dynamics.

BRICS promise of inclusion and to enhance broader cooperation mechanism is not a fluke. At the 14th BRICS Summit, held by video link last year and chaired by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, he urged his colleagues to "uphold openness and inclusiveness and pool collective wisdom and strength", and added that BRICS countries gather not in a closed circle but a big family of mutual support and a partnership for win-win cooperation". He noted that over the past five years, the BRICS has organised a variety of BRICS PLUS events which serve as a platform for cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries and set a prime example of South-South cooperation.

African countries, who have had extensive and pragmatic cooperation with China in both bilateral relations and the multilateral framework of the Forum on China-Africa cooperation, FOCAC, and the Belt and Road Initiative, BRI, have experiences of practical and tangible outcomes which have considerably supported their economic transformation. With the BRICS mechanism either through outright membership or more concerted outreach, they would have no doubts at all about the BRICS transformative impacts.

The Ukraine conflict, which is Europe's most fratricidal war since the end of World War II has rudely awakened African countries to mortal dangers of geo-political alliances and bloc confrontation. During the cold war, African countries insulated themselves from the ideological and military confrontation through the Non-Aligned Movement. The Non-Aligned Movement has significantly declined due to the thaw in the ideological and even prospective, military conflict between the then USSR-led Warsaw pact treaty and the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.

The conflict in Ukraine and the Washington/Brussels led efforts to compel African countries to line behind their proxy war with Russia have exerted imaginative thinking in several quarters in Africa about a prospective and genuine multilateral international framework that is neither an Alliance, Bloc nor an exclusive club. The BRICS mechanism fits the bill. Even though a party to conflict in Ukraine, Moscow is not known to have exerted any pressure among her BRICS partners to back her. Countries in the BRICS including China, Brazil, India and South Africa have demonstrated a long standing commitment to peaceful, diplomatic and negotiated settlement of the conflict.

China has issued a 12-point plan for negotiated settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. Washington and its NATO not only denounced the plan but rather stepped up their supply of lethal weapons to the war theatre in an obvious futile geopolitical fantasy to defeat Russia, a nuclear armed state. African countries who have to stave off pressures from the Washington-led NATO, to stay off the conflict, view the BRICS as the reincarnation of the Non-Aligned Movement, NAM, a historical framework of positive neutrality which many countries in the global South, including African countries, used to insulate themselves from the dangerous vagaries of the cold war confrontation.

With the NATO exclusive club, desperate to bifurcate the world into allies and enemies, African countries would reach to their historic wisdom to stay away from the rampaging Western alliance. The BRICS would function for most of African countries not only as an international economic framework but a geopolitical shield from the excesses of the hawkish US-led NATO Alliance. The BRICS 15th Summit in South Africa would be a watershed for African countries in particular and the global South in general. Already South Africa, the Chair of the Summit, has already invited all the 53 African countries and numerous other countries from the global South.

While African countries would seek to shield themselves from undue geopolitical pressure through BRICS as a credible multilateral framework, it(BRICS) will seek to end the dominance of the US dollar as the sole international currency for settlement. As the United States, unilaterally, tinkers with her currency with applications of flexible interest rate regimes to manage its own economy as she has sovereign right to do, countries in Africa whose external debts are mostly denominated in dollars suffer sudden explosion in their debt burden, thereby forcing more structural disarticulations to their respective economies.

Africa free trade area, the world largest trade zone, will be both spurred by the BRICS engagement, and also a unique opportunity for the BRICS mechanism. The free trade area will offer Africa the scope of an economy of scale to rationalise and optimise resources allocation, and would generate the momentum for the BRICS to rationalise their out ward investment to a huge market with potential for investment returns. Africa and the BRICS have complementarity in opportunity costs and even risk sharing. All these prospects are not going to be freely on offer, given that the global North, and especially the US-led Western alliance long used to "rule-based international order" drawn and set exclusively by them, will not watch gleefully why its well-crafted global dominance unravels.

A genuinely global multilateral platform would up-end several framework of "rules-based international order" elaborately crafted and sustained by the West. Despite that the contemporary trend and historical process validate and support multilateralism, there should be no illusion that it can be secured without a struggle. BRICS stands on the threshold of history but must push and exert itself to the utmost, to book a place in history.

BRICS Chair President Cyril Ramaphosa's media briefing remarks announcing the outcomes of the XV BRICS Summit

Excellencies,

TD 
	

Members of the Media,

Good Afternoon,

We successfully concluded the 15th BRICS Summit yesterday.

It is the first BRICS Summit to be hosted in-person since the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent global travel restrictions.

Leading up to the Summit, there was a wide-ranging BRICS business programme aimed at attracting investment, promoting collaboration and showcasing opportunities within South Africa, Africa and BRICS countries.

We welcome the clear vision of Ms Dilma Rousseff as the President of the New Development Bank on the role that the Bank should play in support of infrastructure and sustainable development in Africa and the Global South.

We celebrated the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the BRICS Business Council and welcomed the self-review by the Council and the subsequent recommendations made to Leaders.

We also welcomed the work of the BRICS Women's Business Alliance in their first in-person engagement with leaders. We particularly welcomed the participation of youth representatives in the Summit.

We addressed our expectations for the BRICS economic partnership to generate tangible benefits for our communities and deliver viable solutions for common challenges faced by the global South.

We shared our vision of BRICS as a champion of the needs and concerns of the peoples of the Global South. These include the need for beneficial economic growth, sustainable development and reform of multilateral systems.

We reiterate our commitment to inclusive multilateralism and upholding international law, including the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.

We are concerned about ongoing conflicts in many parts of the world. We stress our commitment to the peaceful resolution of differences and disputes through dialogue and inclusive consultation.

The Summit noted that an unbalanced recovery from the hardship of the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating inequality across the world.

We encourage multilateral financial institutions and international organisations to play a constructive role in building global consensus on economic policies.

We have noted that there is global momentum for the use of local currencies, alternative financial arrangements and alternative payment systems.

As BRICS, we are ready to explore opportunities for improving the stability, reliability and fairness of the global financial architecture.

The Summit agreed to task the BRICS Finance Ministers and/or Central Bank Governors, as appropriate, to consider the issue of local currencies, payment instruments and platforms and report back to the BRICS leaders by the next Summit.

This Summit reaffirmed the importance of BRICS people-to-people exchanges in enhancing mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation.

The Summit appreciates the progress made over the last year in the fields of media, culture, education, sports, arts, youth, civil society and academic exchanges.

We adopted the Johannesburg II Declaration which reflects key BRICS messages on matters of global economic, financial and political importance.

It demonstrates the shared values and common interests that underlie our mutually beneficial cooperation as the five BRICS countries.

BRICS itself is a diverse group of nations.

It is an equal partnership of countries that have differing views but have a shared vision for a better world.

As the five BRICS countries, we have reached agreement on the guiding principles, standards, criteria and procedures of the BRICS expansion process, which has been under discussion for quite a while.

We have consensus on the first phase of this expansion process, and further phases will follow.

We have decided to invite the Argentine Republic, the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to become full members of BRICS. The membership will take effect from 1 January 2024.

We value the interest of other countries in building a partnership with BRICS.

We have tasked our Foreign Ministers to further develop the BRICS partner country model and a list of prospective partner countries and report by the next Summit.

Today, we will be hosting leaders from Africa and the Global South in the BRICS-Africa Outreach and BRICS Plus Dialogue.

This is so that we can have an inclusive dialogue on key issues affecting developing economies and identify actions that we can take together towards a more equitable, inclusive and representative world.

May I conclude by thanking the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and China, together with their delegations, for participating in this most successful 15th BRICS Summit held in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Through this Summit, BRICS has embarked on a new chapter in its effort to build a world that is fair, a world that is just, a world that is also inclusive and prosperous.

I thank you.

HD 	World Bank Climate Finance Plan Little Help, Unfair

The World Bank plans to use public funds to subsidize private finance, ostensibly to mobilize much more capital to address the climate crisis. But the new plan is likely to be a distraction, not the solution it purports to be.

Rich nations have contributed most to the current climate crisis. They are primarily responsible for the historical emissions and greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation of the last two centuries.

TD 
	

Developing countries, especially in the tropics and sub-tropics, are the main victims of global warming today. Most need finance and other means to build resilience and to develop in the face of the climate crisis. But the rich have resisted major efforts to help developing nations better cope with the crisis.

Climate finance lacking

But recent international climate finance flows fall far short of developing countries' needs, not only in the aggregate, but also due to their restrictive terms. Nonetheless, increasing demands have been made of the global South to stem the growing crisis.

Meanwhile, climate finance has become increasingly commercial, not concessional. After all, most international agreements tend to be poor compromises reflecting corporate and political power in the world. They fail to address the crisis, let alone advance climate justice.

Rich nations have fallen far behind on their $100 billion annual finance commitment for the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference. This modest commitment was supposed to increase significantly after 2020, but there have been no signs of progress, e.g., at French President Macron's recent summit.

Instead of helping developing countries cope with more funds for adaptation, most available resources have been earmarked for mitigation. Finance for mitigation is over ten times more than the $56bn (8.4%) available for adaptation in 2020.

Meanwhile, official development assistance (ODA) has long fallen short of the promise of 0.7% of rich nations' national incomes made over half a century ago. This fell further after the end of the first Cold War, over three decades ago, to barely 0.3%!

Much ODA has gone to climate finance, resulting in double counting. As concessional finance - especially its grant content - declines, developing countries have no choice but to turn to commercial loans as 'debt-pushers' gain influence the world over.

Meanwhile, the USA, the dominant World Bank (WB) shareholder, has blocked increasing WB capitalization, to avoid China gaining more influence with a greater capital share.

WB subsidizes private finance

The WB has revised its earlier failed 'playbooks' as global warming accelerates, with worsening consequences, especially for the global South. Its new plan - Evolving the World Bank Group's Mission, Operations, and Resources - was issued in early 2023.

Eurodad warns, while it "seeks to incorporate climate considerations, the Roadmap does not address the continuing contradictions in its operations". Most worryingly, ever more private commercial finance is being touted as development and/or climate finance.

Despite being among the world's largest public lenders, the WB has been slow to provide climate finance, and is already years behind schedule. It is not even aligned with the non-binding 2015 Paris Agreement goals, with new operations only scheduled to become aligned from mid-2023!

Worse, WB subsidiaries - the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency - will only become aligned from mid-2025, a decade after Paris! Also, its climate finance definition, data and corporate strategy remain controversial and unhelpful.

Meanwhile, the WB has worsened the climate crisis, e.g., by providing $16 billion of project finance for fossil fuels since 2015. Its involvement in Clean Development Mechanism projects involves a 'serious conflict of interests', profiting from the climate crisis while worsening it!

The WB Group (WBG) intends to mobilize private capital with de-risking strategies, such as blended finance. Instead of using public finance to provide concessional terms to the deserving, public funds will thus make commercial finance more profitable.

Despite much cause for concern and caution, the WB's problematic 2017 Maximizing Finance for Development promotes commercial finance as the main source of development and climate funding.

The WBG claims to want greater development and climate impacts from private commercial finance. This is undoubtedly in line with the WB creed that only the private sector can overcome the climate crisis despite being its major enabler, if not cause.

Such initiatives by former WB president Jim Kim and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney are considered 'much ado about nothing' by many in the global South. Enabling profit-seeking businesses to call the shots can hardly be the solution, and may instead worsen the problem.

Way forward?

Developing country leaders have long appealed for a new 'international financial architecture' to better address development and climate challenges, drawing support from civil society, especially in the global South.

Without any agreed multilateral definition of climate finance, governments and corporations are 'greenwashing' their financial abuses by labelling their financial operations as constituting climate and development finance.

As poor nations in the tropical zone suffer the worse consequences of accelerating global warming, only multilateral recognition of the need for financial reparations to address historical and contemporary losses and damages.

It is unlikely the needed climate financing will be voluntarily provided by those most responsible for the climate crisis. At the very least, rich nations should support regular issue of IMF Special Drawing Rights in the near term within the constraints imposed by likely US Congressional disapproval.

These should be urgently reallocated for concessional climate finance in the coming years prioritizing the adaptation needs of developing nations, prioritizing cumulative losses and damages due to the climate crisis.

Meanwhile, Eurodad urges penalizing "the private sector of the developed global north for failure to meet its carbon emission reduction" promises as it is responsible for over 90% of excess GHG emissions.

It has also called for "providing developmental space for developing countries" to progress, and re-orienting "the bank's developmental model towards climate reparations", especially for Africa, the least developed countries and small island developing states.

But the WB plan offers no major improvements, only more of the same. Instead, the WB should help the UN design and implement a comprehensive monitoring and reporting framework for all development and climate finance, including private finance.

By recognizing the international and intergenerational inequities of global warming, the WB can become far more equitable by ensuring all nations develop sustainably while addressing the climate crisis.

To do so, it will need to uphold 'polluters pay' and 'common, but differentiated responsibilities' principles, enshrined in international climate agreements.

HD 	Extra BRICS Shouldn't Be Used to Build a Wall Against the West

As interest in joining BRICS soars, an expansion must be about more than the 'West versus the Rest'.

This year's Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) summit will have a distinctive African flavour. Hosted by its only African member, the meeting has an African theme and will be attended by many African leaders as part of an outreach programme. It is expected to consider at least six African countries' applications for membership.

TD 
	

The theme of the 22-24 August summit is 'BRICS and Africa: Partnership for Mutually Accelerated Growth, Sustainable Development, and Inclusive Multilateralism'. Sixty-seven leaders from the global south have been invited. Significantly, French President Emmanual Macron - who told Pretoria he would like to attend - hasn't been invited.

Interest in joining BRICS has surged. At a briefing this week, South Africa's international relations Minister Naledi Pandor said while several more nations had shown interest, 23 had formally applied. These were Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Morocco, Nigeria, State of Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Vietnam.

Pandor said this indicated recognition of BRICS as a champion of the global south, and the benefits of membership. South Africa's BRICS 'sherpa' Anil Sooklal believes one reason for seeking membership now is the growing polarisation impelled by Russia's war on Ukraine and rising United States-China tensions. These create anxiety among smaller nations, and an impetus to seek 'security in numbers.'

Not all six African governments that formally applied have officially confirmed this. Algeria, Egypt and Ethiopia have - but Nigeria, Senegal and Morocco's positions are unclear.

Countries' motivations for becoming members of BRICS differ even among current members

Nigeria's Ambassador to Russia, Abdullahi Shehu, was recently quoted as saying accession talks hadn't commenced, but he didn't rule out future membership. However Nigeria's Guardian cites several experts as saying Nigeria isn't ready for BRICS membership. They say it lacks economic sophistication - including having little to export to other BRICS countries besides oil. Also, the new reformist Bola Tinubu administration has much on its plate.

Nigeria analyst and Chief Executive of Africa @ Work Dianna Games told ISS Today she was surprised to see Nigeria on the list, but added: 'Tinubu is very proactive, so it's possible he could be driving something like that, looking to spread influence because Nigeria has turned quite inwards under Buhari in foreign policy, and perhaps he is trying to regain lost ground in terms of influence.'

What each African country hopes to get from BRICS is diverse and somewhat unclear. Egypt would probably be among the first to join, especially as it's already a member of BRICS' New Development Bank. Cairo is particularly interested in BRICS' plans to shift more trade from the US dollar into local currencies - and even perhaps to create its own currency.

Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune sees joining as helping to create a more equitable world order, which would help Algeria distance itself 'from the attraction of the two poles.' His foreign minister recently expressed hopes for deriving trade benefits.

BRICS is not a trade bloc - only about 6% of the five BRICS members' total trade is with each other

These views reveal common misconceptions about BRICS. The two poles Tebboune referred to - which are growing further apart due to the Ukraine war - are clearly the West on the one side and Russia and China on the other. So BRICS can hardly be called non-aligned.

And seeing BRICS as a useful trade booster misses the fact that it's not a trade bloc at all. Pandor highlighted that BRICS countries have around 42% of the world's population and 30% of its territory, 27% of global GDP and 20% of international trade. But only about 6% of the total trade of the five members is with each other.

BRICS is nonetheless a useful economic club - most concretely through its New Development Bank, which has already loaned US$5.4 billion to South Africa for five projects. But viewed geopolitically, BRICS is less of a non-aligned 'champion of the global south' as Pandor put it this week, than an alternative to a Western-dominated world, as Tebboune says - or even, more pointedly, anti-Western.

This is a prickly point. Pandor said South Africa didn't 'see BRICS as being pro-Russia or anti-Western ... South Africa's trading partners in the West are very, very important to South Africa's economic progress.' Games also didn't think Nigeria would join BRICS to tip the global power balance against the West, as it valued all its main trading partners equally.

Priyal Singh, Institute for Security Studies Senior Researcher, says the motivation for BRICS membership differs even among current members. 'India, for example, has consistently pointed to its pursuit of "strategic autonomy" on the world stage; and a stronger (or enlarged) BRICS grouping aligns with this foreign policy objective. This is also a compelling narrative for Brazil and South Africa, with Pretoria leaning heavily into its pursuit of a more multipolar international order narrative.'

As tensions rise over Ukraine and Taiwan, Russia and China increasingly see BRICS as an alliance against the West

But as tensions rise over Ukraine and Taiwan, Russia and China increasingly appear to regard BRICS as an alliance against the West, and so presumably would some candidate members like Iran and Venezuela.

Yet such an alliance has its own fault lines, most notably the tensions between China and India, especially over their Kashmir border dispute. Last week South African President Cyril Ramaphosa reportedly called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to persuade him that it was worth attending the summit in person.

And it's not coincidental that Russia and China, BRICS' two autocratic members, are apparently most enthusiastic about expanding membership while democratic India and Brazil are wary (with South Africa in the middle), a South African official said off the record.

This seems to be why the five BRICS members' foreign ministers are still struggling, days before the summit, to agree on membership criteria to submit to the heads of state. Defining the bloc's identity and global role has also become a struggle.

'I certainly would guard against any criteria for expansion that would lead us down a path where we contribute to increasing conflict in the global community or in any part of the world,' Pandor said. That is probably not how China and Russia see the issue.

BRICS offers benefits to its members, including more choices in development financing, collaboration on issues such as health, and gradual independence from the dollar's dominance. But anyone contemplating membership must be wary about the danger of going down precisely the path that Pandor warned against.

International Relations and Cooperation Minister, Dr Naledi Pandor, says she is confident that the upcoming BRICS Summit will strengthen the bloc's partnership and benefit the people of South Africa, BRICS, Africa and the global South.

"We call on South Africans to continue to extend the warmest of South African welcomes to the many official delegates, businesspeople, media and civil society, who will arrive from various parts of the continent and the world shortly for the summit," she said on Monday.

TD 
	

The Minister was addressing members of the media on South Africa's state of readiness to host the 15th BRICS Summit, scheduled for 22 to 24 August 2023 at the Sandton Convention Centre.

Pandor told the media that President Cyril Ramaphosa has confirmed South Africa's readiness to host the upcoming BRICS Summit, which will be hosted in person for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic.

"We chair BRICS in a dynamic global environment where the eyes of the world are on us. Developments in the ICC [International Criminal Court] were the sole topic of discussion around the summit for most of the year.

"We have consistently stated that we are aware of our domestic and international legal obligations. We have also been very conscious of the diplomatic implications of the narratives created around these developments."

Following an intensive engagement with the five-nation grouping, BRICS, she reaffirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would "actively" participate in the summit virtually.

She announced that the remaining leaders of Brazil, India, China, and South Africa would attend physically.

BRICS Business Forum

Leading up to the summit, Pandor said the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition and the BRICS Business Council will host a BRICS Business programme from 19 to 23 August 2023.

The gathering, according to the Minister, seeks to foster economic growth, promote collaboration, attract investment, and display opportunities within South Africa, Africa, and BRICS countries.

"All the BRICS Business Councils are bringing large business delegations to South Africa."

South Africa's overall trade with its BRICS partners, Pandor said has increased by an average growth of 10% between 2017 and 2021.

She told the media that the South African trade with BRICS reached R830 billion in 2022 from R487 billion in 2017.

"Last year, BRICS accounted for 21% of South Africa's global trade."

South African industry leaders, BRICS experts and invited African businesses will engage in a range of dialogues.

She believes that this fosters an environment of collaboration, driving strategic economic partnerships to expand trade and investment opportunities, knowledge exchange, and capacity building.

Leaders' retreat

"Following the Business Forum, the leaders move to a quieter venue for the BRICS Leaders Retreat."

This is a signature event of South Africa as BRICS Chair where leaders meet in a comfortable setting in a private venue to discuss contemporary issues of importance.

"There is no set agenda and leaders can initiate a discussion on issues of choice such as BRICS membership expansion, reform of global governance, or use of local currencies."

New Development Bank

The leaders will also discuss the New Development Bank (NDB), established by BRICS Members in 2015 to play a catalytic role in providing financial support to emerging markets and developing countries for infrastructure and sustainable development.

The bank, Pandor said, has to date approved twelve projects in South Africa, valued at around $5.4 billion, to improve service delivery in critical areas.

Former President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who was elected as President of the NDB this year, will engage with the BRICS leaders to talk about the management of the bank since her appointment.

Expansion

BRICS leaders are also expected to discuss the issue of membership expansion.

She said the bloc has had formal expressions of interest from the leaders of 23 countries in joining BRICS.

The President has therefore invited 67 leaders from Africa and the global South to attend the BRICS-Africa Outreach and BRICS Plus Dialogues.

To date, confirmations have been received from no less than 34 countries.

HD 	Ways to Narrow Educational Inequality in the Global South

The pandemic undermined the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. The prosperity of the Global South, including Nigeria, depends on universal quality education at the foundation level. This article highlights how the pandemic reversed the gains realised since 2015. It describes how technology and partnership could help build back the educational sector to achieve inclusive quality learning.

TD 
	

Educational inequality describes the disparity in education opportunities among socio-economic, regional, and cultural groups. In Nigeria, for example, the school completion rate among children from wealthy households and the southern region is 63% and 34% higher than those from low-income families and the northern part. Such educational inequalities contribute to widening disparity in opportunities. People with low or little education are more likely to work in the informal sector and low-wage employment. High educational disparities are associated with lower human capital development, limiting long-term economic growth. Reducing educational inequality is at the centre of SDG 4, which aims to leave no one behind.

With the COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing aftershock, educational inequalities might widen over time and reduce the likelihood of achieving SDG target 4.1 without concrete policy initiatives. Prolonged school closure has elevated the risk of dropping out among children from lower socio-economic backgrounds. It has been estimated that the number of out-of-school children in Nigeria increased by 5%. Many school-aged children engaged in child labour during the pandemic to supplement household income. This phenomenon suggests that an average child, especially those from low-income households, had little or no time to learn during the pandemic's peak.

Our estimation of the learning loss due to COVID-19 shows a 10% decline in students' performance in 2020 in relation to the 2016/17 and 2018/19 academic sessions among the final-year primary school children in Nigeria. There are multiple channels through which the pandemic education disruption has been sustained. First, the absence of effective learning recovery plans after the reopening of schools in many developing countries implies the learning loss will intensify. It will, over time, translate into weak human capital. Second, the economic slowdown and fiscal squeezing that has become prevalent within the Global South since the pandemic has affected government and household investment in education.

Another revealing observation from the COVID-19 shock is the lack of resilience in the Nigerian education system. With low technology adoption in schools, education apps or online learning approaches were inaccessible to most disadvantaged households. The government introduced alternative learning platforms through radio and TV. These are known as 'on-air programmes' and are meant to ensure students stay engaged during school closures. However, these alternatives are not a perfect substitute for classroom teaching. They lack immediate feedback, have an unreliable electricity supply, and parents cannot perform the role of teachers. These issues were most pronounced among poor households and rural areas, where electricity penetration and ownership of the learning tools were very unlikely.

How can we decrease educational inequality?

As much as the pandemic has negatively affected the education sector, it also points to the role of technology and partnerships as a tool to recover the learning loss and reset the global education agenda. Here are our suggestions on how to improve learning in countries such as Nigeria in the post-pandemic era:

Technology - Increase investment in digital infrastructure

While phone and internet access have improved in Nigeria recently, quality and costs represent huge adoption barriers for disadvantaged households. Still, studies have shown that if implemented well, low-cost technologies such as radio, TV or SMS support learning and have significant outreach. It points to a role for a blended learning environment for the future education sector in the Global South. Technological advancement expands the option for virtual learning, bringing about the required innovations in creating platforms that can complement face-to-face class interaction.

Embrace partnerships to upscale accelerated learning programmes

With government-limited fiscal space, the authorities could partner with international development institutions, local education experts, and philanthropies to design and implement accelerated learning recovery. It will ensure that the weak foundation laid due to the pandemic is rebuilt with a reorientation of the education system. The involvement of local experts would ensure that the accelerated learning programme integrates local reality into student learning. The partnership can also improve the funding of education through the mobilisation of domestic and external resources.

Prioritising the vulnerable groups in recovery efforts

Inequality is higher after the pandemic. It is vital to reset the education sector to better align with learning goals and enhance the teacher support system. Such interventions need to prioritise the disadvantaged groups who are disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 shock.

The pandemic has exacerbated the issues around access and quality of education in the Global South. New challenges with higher-level education inequalities and a wider digital divide have emerged. Yet, it is possible to draw on lessons around the importance of technology, partnership and effective education workforce, recovery and more inequitable education. These aim should be to build resilience in the educational system and tackle the learning loss.

HD 	India - Modi's Call for AU Membership in the G20 and the China Factor

The Hindu nationalist leader's G20 Africa membership appeal casts him in a heroic, anti-imperialist glow. What does his silence on the same issue among BRICS members reveal?

TD 
	

India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi's recent call for the African Union's full membership in the G20 in June 2023 revives the longstanding debate over the G20's enlargement. The call for the AU's membership echoes previous calls by other members. Before hosting the G20 Summit last year, Indonesia - not unlike the way Modi has gone about it - raised the issue for discussion. More recently, US President Joe Biden championed the cause of full membership for the AU. Ostensibly, Washington wants to enhance representation; keener observers suspect other motives, not least countering growing Chinese influence in Africa.

South Africa is the only African country with a permanent seat in the G20, while the European Union (EU) is the sole non-state entity represented. Despite almost half the G20 members belonging to the Global North, the Global South and swing states enjoy relatively stronger positions within the G20 than other platforms. Remarkably, Africa still does not have a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, and faces underrepresentation or limited influence in institutions such as the IMF and, more than a little surprisingly, its own African Development Bank; only five of the top ten shareholders are African states, with the US, Japan, Germany, Canada and France the other significant minority shareholders.

While the African Union joining the G20 would improve global governance and continental representation, India's interest in this issue goes beyond representation. New Delhi's realpolitik, strategic, domestic and international considerations play a significant role in its AU call.

The G20 is essentially an economic club, representing approximately 85% of global GDP. If the AU joined it, the G21 would be even more representative, Africa's population constituting 17% of humanity, and its economy adding $3 trillion into the G21 pot. And with its inordinate share of minerals powering the digital age, it is Africa's strategic importance to the future that would be at the heart of the G21's raison d'etre.

India's Domestic and Global Quest

India's AU request plays into Modi's bigger agenda to project himself to domestic audiences as an influential global figure by fusing India's prestige as host of the G20 meetings with his own as current G20 president. Karishma Mehrotra and Gerry Shih have commented on India's unprecedented PR campaign around this year's summit: projecting a hologram onto Humayun's Tomb; parading G20-themed floats at local religious festivals; incorporating the G20 logo into nationwide pupils' exams; launching a national billboard campaign themed 'India: Mother of Democracy', all of which raise the ruling BJP's Hindu nationalist jingoism to new heights.

Part of Modi's goal is to position himself as the voice of the developing world. Indeed, this quest carries echoes of India's anti-colonialist history as a bulwark of the Non-Aligned Movement, recalling first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru's foreign policy approach.

Prime Minister Modi emphasised the connection between being the voice of the Global South and his support for the African Union's membership, stating in a speech, "Giving a voice to the Global South is the way forward; that is why I firmly believe African Union be given full membership of G20." This sentiment reflects India's commitment to advocating the interests and representation of developing nations on the international stage.

Modi's AU advocacy aligned as it is with Washington's entrenched China antipathy, may be an attempt to balance the latter's growing influence, cultivated over the past two decades via what some detractors describe as 'debt trap diplomacy'. Given, however, that both India and China are BRICS members, Modi's support for AU membership at the G20 will ultimately count as part of the longer struggle to rebalance global power in favour of the South. In realpolitik terms, however, it allows New Delhi autonomously to pursue global influence and leverage, furthering its geopolitical goals.

Contrary to India's insistence on G20's enlargement, India does not welcome enlargement in BRICS - a quintet organisation in which Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are members. This is partly due to the fact that any possible BRICS engagement will not favour India, but will likely increase Chinese influence on the bloc. Forty nations have shown interest in joining BRICS. Among these possible members, African nations have shown great interest, such as Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Egypt, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Comoros, and Gabon. Because the influence of India might decrease with the enlargement of BRICS, Modi does not show a similar embracement of the Global South's representation.

Moreover, looking at this year's G20 guest list, Indian strategic choices betray its domestic preoccupations. India invited Oman and the United Arab Emirates, two Gulf countries hosting thousands of Indian migrant workers whose remittances constitute an important source of family and wider support. Considering the region is already represented by Saudi Arabia in the G20, the choice is more about bilateral relations than regional representation. Similarly, the invitation of Bangladesh to the summit shows the alliance's role in the invitation.

Most of the G20 members declared their support for the African Union's membership application. For example, Canada, Brazil, China, Russia, South Africa, France, the US, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, India, Japan, and Italy, already announced that they will support the AU's membership. Should it happen, it will be the first-ever enlargement since the club's foundation in 1999. Indeed, this will test their honesty and a chance for better global representation in important institutions such as G20. Moreover, because G20 discusses issues that affect the continent significantly, such as climate, food security, and trade, it is important for around 50 countries to be represented by more than just South Africa.

HD 	Will Ukraine Be Able to Win Over the Global South in Its Fight Against Russian Aggression?

I was running from my home in Kyiv as the Russian army occupied Bucha, Gostomel and Irpin in the early stages of its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

By accident, I was leaving in a bus that a nearby international school was using to evacuate its students and staff. We drove for a long time, spending nights in bomb shelters with young people and their kids from China, the Middle East and India who had been studying and working in Ukraine.

TD 
	

When the war broke out, Ukraine was hosting tens of thousands of students from the Global South and was generally viewed as a partner in many countries.

But the war disrupted everything, including public opinion in many of these same countries. Now, Ukraine is struggling to gain support in the Global South, which has shown ambivalence about the invasion and been reticent to cut off ties with Russia.

Differences of opinion

After the February 2022 invasion, Ukraine's leaders tried to rally the world's support by focusing on a narrative of fighting for democracy and decolonisation.

As Ukrainians, we see our country as a bastion of democratic values and oppose the totalitarianism taking root in Russia. At the same time, Ukraine perceives the war as a national liberation effort - freedom from centuries of colonial oppression by Russia and the Soviet Union and the enforced dominance of the Russian language.

While the democratic narrative continues to resonate strongly with Ukraine's western allies, the decolonisation narrative appears to have made little impact outside Ukraine - particularly in the Global South.

Most countries in the Global South, which includes Africa, Latin America and much of Asia and Oceania, used to be ruled by colonial powers. But it is clear there is not much solidarity with Ukraine's goal of decisively ending Russia's colonial influence in the former Soviet republic.

In fact, Ukrainian researchers monitoring the news in the Global South have found many media outlets are instead broadcasting manipulative pro-Kremlin messages.

For instance, the researchers found the Russian claim that Ukraine was being run by Nazis had gained popularity in some countries.

Specifically, there were reports in the Brazilian media that the CIA had organised a "Nazi coup" in Ukraine in 2014, referring to the country's Revolution of Dignity. One Indian publication went even further, spreading the message that "descendants of the Nazis" came to power in Ukraine after the Orange Revolution in 2004.

These messages are helping to drive public opinion. A global survey conducted one year into the war revealed a large gap between the West and "the rest" when it comes to views of Russia and how the war should end.

As foreign policy analyst Bobo Lo writes, few countries in the Global South are keen to see a "triumphant West", even if they have misgivings about Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions.

They would much rather a world where US and Western power is counterbalanced by other centres of influence. Smaller players would retain agency, preserve their political autonomy, and perhaps leverage great power rivalry to their advantage.

Why does so much of the Global South support Russia?

To be clear, attitudes toward the devastating war vary considerably across the Global South - the region is no monolith of public opinion. And most countries maintain the importance of safeguarding Ukraine's existing borders.

However, opinion polls in places like China, India and Turkey show a clear preference for the war to end now - even if that means Ukraine having to give up territory.

Clear majorities in Indonesia, Turkey and India also favour maintaining diplomatic relations with Russia.

Many countries of the Global South have a deep-seated "non-aligned" tradition dating back to the Cold War. Their colonial history reinforces a skepticism about the West. Some have also pointed out the West's hypocrisy in criticising Russia's invasion of Ukraine, given the US and its allies waged disastrous wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.

The war in Ukraine has also widened the gap between the Global North and South and exposed their different priorities.

While Western leaders are concerned about Russia's disruption of the liberal democratic order and the rise of China, much of the Global South is focused on economic and development challenges, such as debt relief, food security and climate mitigation.

Even when emerging powers agree with the West, they often maintain good relations with Russia and China. This is what Brazil is currently doing: President Luiz Inácio "Lula" da Silva advocates maintaining his country's neutrality towards Ukraine and Russia in order to avoid "any involvement, even indirect" in the war. He has, however, acknowledged Russia "has been wrong" to invade a neighbouring country.

Many countries have also pursued their own interests in the face of geopolitical polarisation. Some depend on Russia for wheat, energy and military hardware, or on China for investment, credit and trade.

Specifically, Russia has established a significant presence in parts of Africa. The private military contractor Wagner is operating across the continent, and the Russian and Chinese militaries recently held joint exercises with South Africa.

African leaders are also meeting with Putin this week in St. Petersburg as part of the second Russia-Africa Summit. The first edition, held in 2019, resulted in 92 agreements and contracts worth over US$11 billion.

Is the war of words lost?

Ukraine is aware that its relationship with the Global South is weak. Kyiv has struggled to get its message across to countries on the African continent, in particular, where it has only 10 embassies - a mere quarter of the Russian presence.

Ukraine is now working on opening more embassies and appointing ambassadors across Africa.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also identified the Global South as a priority in international relations. For instance, his foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, embarked this week on his third tour of African countries. The trip was seen as pivotal, with Russia pulling out of a deal to allow Ukraine to export its grain, which is hugely important to many African countries.

Last month, Zelensky also met with seven African leaders in Ukraine, where he stressed the need for "real peace" in the conflict and a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.

Zelensky has promised to do more to ensure food security in the Global South, for example, through the creation of grain hubs. He also noted Ukraine is ready to significantly expand educational programs for students from Africa.

But will this be enough to persuade the Global South to do more to support Ukraine in the war?

There was once a street in Kyiv named after the Congolese freedom fighter Patrice Lumumba. Lumumba was vital to Africa's struggle for independence and the end of the colonial rule. Before he was brutally murdered, he wrote:

What we wanted for our country -- its right to an honourable life, to perfect dignity, to independence with no restrictions.

Ukrainians can only hope other countries can see their shared aspirations for a fully decolonised world.

HD 	How Empowering Girls and Women Can Change the Future of Africa

Women's empowerment is like a pebble dropped in a pond. The ripples it creates spread far and wide, benefiting everyone in society.

Lack of resources has a devastating impact on individuals, families, and communities. According to the World Bank, about 460 million people in Africa live below the extreme poverty line, which is defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. This means that one in three Africans is living in extreme poverty.

TD 
	

This is a major challenge facing the continent.

Poverty is a complex issue with far-reaching implications, and it has a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable members of society, particularly young women and girls. These girls are often locked in a cycle of deprivation and hardship. They are denied access to education, healthcare, and other resources, making it difficult for them to break the cycle of poverty.

UNESCO reports that one in three girls in sub-Saharan Africa is not in school. WHO reports that girls in poverty are more likely to experience early pregnancy and childbirth, as well as violence, including sexual violence. As a result, their dreams and aspirations are stifled, and they are unable to reach their full potential.

However, despite the challenges they face, these girls are resilient. They have the potential to reshape their destiny and uplift not only themselves but also their communities. It is a pressing call to action to address the systemic inequalities that perpetuate this injustice.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need for holistic approaches to empower girls and women worldwide. This is because traditional approaches, which have focused on education and economic opportunities, have often been insufficient to address the root causes of women's inequality because they have not considered all aspects of women's lives. The Global South is often seen as a place of poverty and despair. However, it is also a place of great innovation and creativity. The women of the Global South are leading the way in developing new approaches to empowerment that are challenging the status quo and creating a more just and equitable world. They are showing the world that women's empowerment is not a luxury, but a necessity.

Empowering girls and women is not just a moral imperative, it is also a smart investment.

When girls and women are empowered, they are more likely to stay in school, get good jobs, and have healthy families, reports UNICEF. They are also more likely to be involved in decision-making at all levels of society. There are many different ways to empower girls and women, but a comprehensive approach involves addressing all aspects of their lives, including education, economics, social status, and political participation.

This has a ripple effect on their communities, families, and countries.

Empowering Women and Girls in Africa

In Africa, women and girls face a number of challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, and gender-based violence. But there are organizations working to address these challenges, and one of the most successful is BRAC International.

BRAC is a global development organization that has been working in Africa for over 50 years. Its holistic approach to empowering girls and women has been very successful. BRAC has reached millions of women and girls in the Global South, and its programs have had a significant impact on their lives. The non-profit organization works with adolescent girls and young women to improve their health, education, and economic empowerment. It also provides girls with information and education about sexual and reproductive health, as well as access to contraception and safe abortion services. BRAC also trains and develops the capacity of small-scale farmers to grow more food, earn more income, and build secure businesses, with a focus on women and youth.

BRAC's work has helped over 15 million adolescent girls and young women in Africa.

Rudo Kayombo, Regional Director of Africa for BRAC International, speaks on the organisation's integrated approach to bringing systemic change for positive and measurable impact for adolescent girls and young women. Kayombo said BRAC International believes that when adult women are empowered, their families, communities, and society as a whole benefit.

"But over the years of working with adult women, we've realized that some of the barriers to economic and social empowerment start when they're younger. Hence, we've adopted the lifecycle approach of trying to target young girls, adolescent girls, and young women earlier, so that we already begin to remove barriers and release their potential for being people who are empowered and who can empower their communities and families."

Initially, BRAC offered financial services to older women. However, they realized that they needed to intervene earlier when they are younger because the barriers to empowerment start manifesting very early. For example, if a girl does not have access to education, she will not be able to develop financial literacy or achieve financial security, and then be able to actualize their potential to seek to achieve life load security. By targeting young girls, adolescent girls, and young women, BRAC is helping to break the cycle of poverty and empower women to reach their full potential. This approach is having a positive impact on families and communities, and it is helping to build a more just and equitable world.

Kayombo added that the most significant barriers to female empowerment are gender norms and cultural beliefs that often lead to girls being denied an education.

"Gender norms and culture still prioritize sending young boys to school, when there are resource constraints, as opposed to young women. This is because a lot of society still believes that women have value when they get married and have children, rather than being able to deploy their economic potential and achieve livelihood security in their own right, which then contributes to lifelong security for their families and communities."

Kayombo explained that BRAC is dedicated to empowering young women and addressing gender disparities to promote gender equality. They have developed an age-appropriate intervention model that focuses on the different needs of girls of different ages. For girls between 10 and 14, BRAC focuses on making sure that they stay in school. They provide financial support for school fees, as well as menstrual hygiene kits. This helps to keep girls in school and prevents them from dropping out at the transition stage from primary to secondary school.

"The primary reasons for dropping out are cultural norms, financial constraints faced by families, and the distance between communities and schools," Kayombo added. "In many areas of Africa and parts of Asia, schools are located far away from where families reside. This poses safety concerns for young girls, leading them to avoid attending school altogether or dropping out at an early age. Additionally, some girls may not even start school until they are much older, further exacerbating the challenges they face. Older girls entering school may feel uncomfortable or lack confidence compared to their male peers."

A lot of it is poverty that keeps a lot of young girls out of school.

Poverty plays a significant role in keeping young girls out of school. To address this issue, BRAC runs programs aimed at keeping girls in school and promoting early childhood education for both girls and boys. They recognize that early childhood education provides a foundation of support that helps children successfully transition from primary to secondary school, resulting in longer school attendance.

"Girls who have access to early childhood education and are supported through the transition from primary to secondary school are more likely to stay in school longer, delay marriage and childbirth, and become economically empowered," said the Regional Director.

Challenges facing Africa and what needs to be done

"We need to make universal access to primary education part of our laws," Kayombo said. "It is imperative to ensure that education is universally accessible and provided free of charge, enabling more young individuals to attend school from an early age. We must support these schools to facilitate a seamless transition to secondary education."

She added that we need to fight gender-based violence, sexual abuse, and sexual harassment, that impedes the progression of young women in particular, through their education, to tertiary studies.

Measuring Impact

Their flagship program, Empowered Livelihoods for Adolescents, has been shown to delay early marriage among participants. This delay in marriage has a positive impact on their empowerment, as they are more likely to stay in school, transition to tertiary education, and secure the skills they need for the job market.

The Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program is a comprehensive program that provides adolescent girls with education, social empowerment, and economic empowerment. The program is designed to help girls develop the skills and knowledge they need to become strong, resilient, and adaptable adults. According to BRAC, ELA clubs are located near girls' homes, providing them with a safe space to socialize with other girls and learn about life skills, livelihoods, and financial literacy. The program also offers girls access to microfinance, which can help them start their own businesses or invest in their education.

Kayombo also went to explain that the early programs targeted mostly young girls and young women. However, there is now a multi-country, multi-year program that also targets adolescent boys and young men. These programs target young men as allies to young women, as we recognize that they are also disadvantaged due to a lack of employment opportunities and skills training. However, we know that the gap is higher for young women, so most of our programs still target them.

The multi-country program is currently in four countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. It has recently kicked off in Rwanda and will expand to Ghana and Kenya in the future.

Vision for Africa

Our vision is that we would not only directly implement these programs that are aimed at accelerating the impact of empowerment programs for young women and adolescent girls and young women, but that we would also be able to share some of our proven modules with other implementers who can roll out integrated programs, she said. One of our successful models is the Ultra-Poor Graduation program, which helps individuals who are not economically active by providing them with livelihood programs and opportunities.

"The program takes people who are not economically active at all up a ladder to a point where they have some livelihoods programs."

"Now, with that program, we implemented this program as BRAC, but we are also collaborating with governments to enable them to scale up the ultra-poor graduation program as part of their safety net programs," she said. "We have ongoing partnerships with the governments of South Africa, Rwanda, and Ethiopia, and we encourage more government-led initiatives in this area. By involving governments, we can achieve faster scalability, but it's important to ensure that these programs are comprehensive rather than limited safety net measures. To achieve scale, we aim to implement programs ourselves, collaborate with partners, and work with government entities."

Kayombo added that they only work with targeted communities where we are already present. This is because our integrated program is rolled out through both our non-governmental organization (NGO) activities and microfinance. If there is no microfinance, the economic empowerment programs may not be sufficiently rolled out. We have a dual-pronged implementation program. We are scaling up as resources become available, but we also work with partner agencies to offer them technical support so that they can roll out similar programs in their areas of operation.

Advice for women working to make a difference

Kayombo said that to effectively reach adolescent girls and young women, it is essential to implement integrated programs that address their multifaceted needs. They need to have sustainable economic livelihoods, but they also need sexual and reproductive health rights, and a voice in their own communities so that they can negotiate the support they need. The best way to address these needs is to roll out holistic, integrated programs that target people's empowerment and self-efficacy, as well as their livelihood security.

"So integrated programs are the way to go," she said.

HD 	Africa's Linguistic Diversity Goes Largely Unnoticed in Research On Multilingualism

Language is a uniquely human skill. That's why studying how people learn and use language is crucial to understanding what it means to be human. Given that most people in the world - an estimated 60% - are multilingual, meaning that they know and use more than one language, a researcher who aims to understand language must also grasp how individuals acquire and use multiple languages.

TD 
	

The ubiquity of multilingualism also has practical consequences. For example, in the early schooling years, children learn more effectively when they are taught in their mother tongue rather than a second or third language. Research also shows that people make different decisions depending on whether they are thinking in their first or second language.

The problem is that much of the published research about multilingualism is not conducted in the world's most multilingual societies. For example, the African continent is home to some of the most multilingual countries in the world. Cameroon has a population of around 27 million people; over 250 different languages are spoken as first languages, often alongside English and French or both.

Studies of African multilingual contexts are almost non-existent in high-impact scientific journals, however. This matters because it is research published in these journals that receives the most attention globally and is therefore most likely to shape people's understanding of multilingualism.

Our recent study provides new empirical evidence of the geographic bias in multilingualism research published in high-impact scientific journals. We show that the regions most commonly studied are not particularly multilingual. The reverse is also true: the most multilingual regions are massively understudied in research on multilingualism.

A glaring mismatch

The mismatch that emerged in our research is neatly illustrated in this map.

The top panel presents a world map of the most common sites of multilingualism research; regions that are more commonly studied appear in darker colours. The map shows that North America and Western Europe are the primary locations of research on multilingualism. China and Australia are also fairly well represented.

This is a stark contrast to the bottom panel, which represents the extent of societal multilingualism in different countries. In this map, the shading represents a country's score on the Linguistic Diversity Index - a measure of the likelihood that two randomly selected individuals from a country will have different first languages. The index ranges from 0 to 1, with largely monolingual societies receiving low scores and largely multilingual societies receiving high scores.

The top and bottom panels are near mirror images of each other: for example, the African continent is almost entirely blank in the top panel and intensely shaded in the bottom panel.

Other highly linguistically diverse regions such as the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia are also underrepresented in the sample as sites of multilingualism research.

Geographic bias is detrimental

This geographic bias is not unique to multilingualism research. It echoes concerns raised in many other scientific fields about the lack of representation of scholars and research locations in the so-called "global south" (Africa, Latin America, and most countries in Asia and Oceania).

In this case, however, the underrepresentation is particularly detrimental. It is precisely in the global south that multilingualism is most common. The predominance of global north research locations, then, means that much of the knowledge of multilingualism stems from regions that are comparatively monolingual.

This is not to say that no research is being carried out in highly multilingual regions. We ourselves are currently conducting a large-scale study on multilingualism in South Africa, and we know of several (South) African scientific journals that regularly publish studies conducted in African countries and other linguistically diverse areas. However, studies published in smaller journals may be less likely to shape the field of multilingualism research.

The reduced visibility of research conducted in the global south has a complex web of causes. These include the unequal distribution of resources (like research infrastructure and research funding), as well as bias in the academic publishing system, which is dominated by global north institutions and publishing houses.

As a consequence of this imbalance, the global north is often seen as the "default" site for research, while global south settings are perceived as specific and a source of knowledge that is not generalisable to other contexts. This is simply untrue.

Tackling the problem

To address the geographic bias that we have identified, the systemic inequalities in academia will need to be targeted. In the meantime, we are pleased to see the smaller steps that are already being taken.

One is increasing the visibility of the research that is being conducted in the global south. An example of an attempt to do this is the 2023 edition of the International Symposium on Bilingualism, which has as its theme "Diversity Now". Furthermore, several high-impact journals have issued calls for studies conducted outside of the typical North American and western European settings.

Big team science, in which many scientists spread across institutions and locations work together, and collaboration between north and south will also help. With these and similar efforts, the field ought to diversify in the years to come and thus increase the validity of our knowledge of the human capacity for language.

HD 	The Global South Is On the Rise - but What Exactly Is the Global South?

The unwillingness of many leading countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America to stand with NATO over the war in Ukraine has brought to the fore once again the term "Global South."

TD 
	

"Why does so much of the Global South support Russia?" inquired one recent headline; "Ukraine courts 'Global South' in push to challenge Russia," declared another.

But what is meant by that term, and why has it gained currency in recent years?

The Global South refers to various countries around the world that are sometimes described as "developing," "less developed" or "underdeveloped." Many of these countries - although by no means all - are in the Southern Hemisphere, largely in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

In general, they are poorer, have higher levels of income inequality and suffer lower life expectancy and harsher living conditions than countries in the "Global North" -- that is, richer nations that are located mostly in North America and Europe, with some additions in Oceania and elsewhere.

Going beyond the 'Third World'

The term Global South appears to have been first used in 1969 by political activist Carl Oglesby. Writing in the liberal Catholic magazine Commonweal, Oglesby argued that the war in Vietnam was the culmination of a history of northern "dominance over the global south."

But it was only after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union - which marked the end of the so-called "Second World" - that the term gained momentum.

Until then, the more common term for developing nations - countries that had yet to industrialize fully - was "Third World."

That term was coined by Alfred Sauvy in 1952, in an analogy with France's historical three estates: the nobility, the clergy and the bourgeoisie. The term "First World" referred to the advanced capitalist nations; the "Second World," to the socialist nations led by the Soviet Union; and the "Third World," to developing nations, many at the time still under the colonial yoke.

Sociologist Peter Worsley's 1964 book, "The Third World: A Vital New Force in International Affairs," further popularized the term. The book also made note of the "Third World" forming the backbone of the Non-Aligned Movement, which had been founded just three years earlier as a riposte to bipolar Cold War alignment.

Though Worsley's view of this "Third World" was positive, the term became associated with countries plagued by poverty, squalor and instability. "Third World" became a synonym for banana republics ruled by tinpot dictators - a caricature spread by Western media.

The fall of the Soviet Union - and with it the end of the so-called Second World - gave a convenient pretext for the term "Third World" to disappear, too. Usage of the term fell rapidly in the 1990s.

Meanwhile "developed," "developing" and "underdeveloped" also faced criticism for holding up Western countries as the ideal, while portraying those outside that club as backwards.

Increasingly the term that was being used to replace them was the more neutral-sounding "Global South."

Geopolitical, not geographical

The term "Global South" is not geographical. In fact, the Global South's two largest countries - China and India - lie entirely in the Northern Hemisphere.

Rather, its usage denotes a mix of political, geopolitical and economic commonalities between nations.

Countries in the Global South were mostly at the receiving end of imperialism and colonial rule, with African countries as perhaps the most visible example of this. It gives them a very different outlook on what dependency theorists have described as the relationship between the center and periphery in the world political economy - or, to put it in simple terms, the relationship between "the West and the rest."

Given the imbalanced past relationship between many of the countries of the Global South and the Global North - both during the age of empire and the Cold War - it is little wonder that today many opt not to be aligned with any one great power.

And whereas the terms "Third World" and "underdeveloped" convey images of economic powerlessness, that isn't true of the "Global South."

Since the turn of the 21st century, a "shift in wealth," as the World Bank has referred to it, from the North Atlantic to Asia Pacific has upended much of the conventional wisdom on where the world's riches are being generated.

By 2030 it is projected that three of the four largest economies will be from the Global South - with the order being China, India, the United States and Indonesia. Already the GDP in terms of purchasing power of the the Global South-dominated BRICS nations - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - surpasses that of the Global North's G7 club. And there are now more billionaires in Beijing than in New York City.

Global South on the march

This economic shift has gone hand in hand with enhanced political visibility. Countries in the Global South are increasingly asserting themselves on the global scene - be it China's brokering of Iran and Saudi Arabia's rapprochement or Brazil's attempt to push a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine.

This shift in economic and political power has led experts in geopolitics like Parag Khanna and Kishore Mahbubani to write about the coming of an "Asian Century." Others, like political scientist Oliver Stuenkel, have began talking about a "post-Western world."

One thing is for sure: The Global South is flexing political and economic muscles that the "developing countries" and the "Third World" never had.

HD 	Debunking Migration Myths - the Real Reasons People Move, and Why Most Migration Happens in the Global South - Podcast

Around the world, borders between countries are getting tougher. Governments are making it more difficult to move, especially for certain groups of vulnerable people. This comes with a message, subtle or not: that people are moving to higher-income countries to take advantage of the welfare system, or the jobs of people already living there.

But evidence shows that much of what we think about migration - particularly those of us in Europe, North America and Australia - is wrong. Political narratives, often replicated in the media, shape the conversation and public attitudes toward migration.

TD 
	

As the researchers we speak to in this episode of The Conversation Weekly tell us, these narratives are not the full picture. Our interviewees explain what migration really looks like around the world, what drives people to uproot their lives and move, and how some countries in Africa are welcoming refugees.

Challenging the narrative

Heaven Crawley, a researcher at UN University Centre for Policy Research based in New York, has been interested in migration since the late 1980s. Then, the breakup of the former Yugoslavia caused what was often referred to as a refugee "crisis" in Europe.

Language like "crisis" has been a part of the discourse on migration for years. But Crawley thinks of this in a particular way: "It's absolutely fair to say that there is a crisis associated with migration. It's normally for the people who are actually moving, because they're often in situations where there are huge inequalities in the right to move."

Crawley shared that migration, while "intrinsic to our economies and the way we function", is not actually the norm. Most people don't migrate, and those who do mostly move within their country of origin.

She explained how, in Europe especially, perceptions of those who do migrate are often clouded by a narrative that people who move, legally, for work are "good" migrants. Conversely, people who move without visa permission or through clandestine means are viewed as "bad" migrants.

In reality, people moving for any reason is usually a force for good for the country they move to and the people they encounter, Crawley suggested. "People are coming to realise that actually, migration can be very positive in terms of their day-to-day lives, who they mix with, who their family are married to."

When people decide to migrate, whether seeking economic opportunities or to escape violence or persecution, there are a number of factors influencing where they go. Valentina Di Iasio, a research fellow at the University of Southampton in the UK, has researched what makes people choose one country over another.

Di Iasio and her colleague Jackie Wahba wanted to investigate the theory of the "welfare magnet", that people choose to migrate to countries where the welfare state is more generous.

But looking specifically at asylum seekers, they found that the strongest "pull factor" attracting people to particular countries is social networks. In other words, it's not about the economy or welfare state, it's about "having the possibility to rely on a community that is already there and already established".

Di Iasio also noted that many countries have policies preventing asylum seekers from working when they first arrive. But she said these policies often backfire, both for people arriving, and the host country's overall economy: "If you ban asylum seekers from employment, this leads people ... to become more dependent on public spending in the short term, and this is not good for anyone."

Migration in the global south

It's impossible to understand the global picture of migration if we only look at specific routes - for example, from India to the UK, or from Mexico to the US. According to Crawley, about one third of global migration happens within the global north (Europe, North America, Australia and parts of Asia), one third happens within the global south (South America, Africa and parts of Asia), and the remaining third is between the two.

With that in mind, we spoke to Christopher Changwe Nshimbi, a researcher at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, about a region with frequent movement across borders. He studies the relationship between migration, development and regional integration (countries forming economic and trade relationships with each other) in Africa.

Nshimbi said that more open borders are beneficial to regional integration in Africa. They allow people to move where their skills are needed, and to send remittances (money) back home to family, often within the same region.

And yet, some countries are tightening their migration policies. Part of this, Nshimbi explained, is even influenced by attitudes in the global north. For example, development funding from the European Union is often tied to efforts to curb migration from Africa to the EU. Nshimbi said that when migrants are seen as a threat to high-income European countries: "The tendency seems to be to try and influence the movement ... of Africans within the African continent."

But he said this approach is misguided, and that funding development in low-income countries "doesn't necessarily translate into people stopping migrating". In some cases, this funding to stop migration has been used in a way that causes instability and violence - and ultimately, more migration.

Looking toward the future

Nshimbi is now researching how the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather patterns, are leading people to migrate. While this will present challenges for governments, Nshimbi said the history of migration on the continent gives him reason to be optimistic.

He said he wonders why European countries talk about refugee "crises" when countries in Africa regularly host many more refugees. Citing the example of Uganda, he said: "There are shining examples on the continent of countries that, though poor, host large numbers of refugees."

Again referencing Uganda, Nshimbi said that some countries are used to hosting refugees, providing them with land and resources so they can participate in local economies until they move elsewhere: "A poor country, but they take care of them."

With improved funding for South Africa's Just Energy Transition, the country will be able to invest significantly in bolstering the electricity grid and new renewable energy generation.

In his weekly newsletter to the nation on Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa said this will significantly help to end load shedding.

TD 
	

The President's newsletter comes after his participation at the New Global Financing Pact Summit in Paris last week, where several world leaders gathered.

"With improved funding for our Just Energy Transition, we will be able to invest substantially in strengthening our electricity grid and new renewable energy generation.

"This will make a significant contribution to ending load shedding and securing a reliable and affordable supply of electricity. This will, in turn, promote economic growth, make our exports more competitive and create employment," he said.

The President explained that the funding will enable the country to develop new industries, such as electric vehicles and green hydrogen, which will increase the country's industrial output and create jobs for the economy of the future.

Through such funding, investment in infrastructure, expanding the capacity of the economy and reducing the costs for emerging businesses will be increased.

"There are immediate challenges that we are addressing as a country. We are working to accelerate the implementation of our Energy Action Plan and Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan so that we can end load shedding, grow the economy and create jobs," he said.

At the same, the President stressed the importance of asserting the needs and interests of developing economies in international fora, so that the country can raise the funds that are required to achieve a just transition and advance developmental objectives.

This is important not only for people in South Africa, but for people throughout the Global South.

In summarising the outcomes of the Summit, French President Emmanuel Macron said: "More than ever, international solidarity and transfers from the richest countries to the most vulnerable ones are essential to shape a fairer world."

President Ramaphosa said this is a view that African leaders share, and they will continue to work with other countries across the world to ensure that it becomes a reality.

Reflecting on the summit, President Ramaphosa reiterated that global development financing, if properly directed and provided on a significant scale, can make a huge difference to the lives of people living in countries like South Africa.

During the summit, the President told world leaders that the Global South "does not want to be treated like beggars, as if we are asking for charity".

"The industrialisation and economic development of the Global North was achieved at the expense of the Global South. Wealthier countries therefore have both an obligation and an interest in supporting development and climate action in poorer countries.

"As South Africa, we argued for a fundamental overhaul of the international financial institutions that are responsible for supporting development across the world," he said.

The President called for a restructuring of bodies such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to be more inclusive and responsive, saying they should provide funding in a way that does not increase the debt burden of countries that are already struggling to service their debt.

The President said the international community must appreciate the scale of the challenge and make sure that sufficient funds are available.

As a start, industrialised countries need to meet their existing commitments, such as mobilising $100 billion a year for climate action in developing economies. He said that even as this goal is achieved, much more money will be needed to ensure an effective response to climate change.

"While the Paris Summit is not a formal structure through which international agreements are reached, it is significant that there was broad consensus among most of the countries that much more funding is needed and that international development banks needed to be significantly reformed to direct that funding to where it will have the greatest impact.

"There was general agreement that additional private sector funding should be mobilised and that funding should be provided on better terms," he said.

HD 	World Bank to Create Catastrophe Toolkit in Response to Calls for Financial System Reform

The debt profiles, especially of countries in the global south, are rising, with many are now adjudged high-risk countries, keeping investors far from them

The

TD 
	

World Bank's President Ajay Banga on Friday said the bank would create a catastrophe toolkit in response to calls for a reform in the global financial architecture.

The debt profiles, especially of countries in the global south, are rising, with many now adjudged high-risk countries, keeping investors far from them. Most of these countries are also the worst hit by climate change. To cater to their disaster-prone population and communities, they continue borrowing at ridiculous interest rates.

Addressing these debts is one of the many development questions that brought about the just concluded summit for a new financial pact and a transformation of the Bretton Wood initiative, which birthed the World Bank.

Mr Banga, who recently assumed office as the new president of the World Bank, attended the summit in Paris. In agreement to the arguments made from Thursday morning through Friday, at a press conference, said the toolkit will be comprehensive and address crisis preparedness, response and recovery.

The World Bank will achieve this in five ways, he said.

The multilateral bank will help governments build advanced emergency systems to respond immediately when an emergency hits. This will allow more countries to build emergency systems and have quick-disbursing finance available in times of crisis.

Additionally, it will provide new types of insurance to back development projects, allowing work to get back on track quickly.

"We actually have these bonds out now in Peru and Jamaica, and the idea is to scale and replicate them to other parts of the world," he said.

According to Mr Banga, this approach will enable businesses to sustain operations and protect jobs, building resilience and long-term sustainability.

The bank also plans to give countries new flexibility to quickly redirect some of their funds for an emergency response to make cash immediately accessible. This will allow countries to immediately repurpose a portion of their lending portfolio for emergency needs when a crisis occurs, including redeploying undisbursed funds in longer-term infrastructure projects for immediate disaster response.

Perhaps the most important to countries in the global south is the plan to pause debt repayments so that countries can focus on what matters and not worry about the bills.

The catastrophe insurance in the World Bank's lending products will enable insurance premiums and interest to be covered through the generosity of others and give countries recovery resources without adding to their debts.

What does this mean for Africa?

Dan Kunle, a Nigerian energy and business consultant, said Africa needs to see the criteria the World Bank is adopting to grant the reliefs. He is certain these criteria will differ from country to country because smaller countries with huge debts and climate hazards will get more urgent attention and possibly generous interventions than bigger countries that are less exposed.

Acknowledging that Africa is faced with poverty and instabilities, including climate change, Mr Kunle noted that "each country in Africa may have to develop their framework for the World Bank offerings because of the peculiarities from region to region.

"Carbon emissions and reductions are paradoxes that national leaders must confront as is the case in China and Germany. Can African countries meet the minimum requirements of the developed countries who are the major inducers of both emissions and reductions now?"

Mr Kunle added that the delicate process of balancing would attract experts and a sustainable period to attain the desired equilibriums.

For Nigeria to key into this, he said the government needs to rapidly study the World Bank's criteria for such reliefs and quickly develop a framework to capture the dynamics surrounding climate change and poverty.

"Nigeria must exhibit transparency in her poverty reduction programme and energy transitions from fossils to clean power", if it must access these reliefs.

A private-sector investment lab

Mr Banga stated that trillions are required to address the challenges confronting the world today, stressing that development banks, government and philanthropists alone cannot address them, and "so we need the private sector."

He added: "Our efforts over the years have not come nowhere near what we need to be showing as an output."

He said this had led the bank to try a new approach called the private sector investment lab, designed to identify and remove the barriers preventing private investment in emerging markets.

"The lab will put an emphasis on scaling transition finance; the initial focus is renewable energy and sustainable energy infrastructure," Mr Banga added.

HD 	Through Carbon Markets, Corporations Have a Role to Play in Africa's Development. They Should Take It Seriously.

Corporations are in a unique position to responsibly engage in the "wild west" that is the carbon-offset market, all while supporting Africa's rising low- and middle-income populations.

Through the purchase of carbon credits, corporations can immediately reduce their global carbon footprints while also serving their long-term economic interests to expand their market bases. That is in part because, by purchasing high-quality carbon credits in voluntary carbon markets, these companies can support the sustainable growth of low- and middle-income populations in the world's fastest-growing regions--including across the African continent.

TD 
	

Voluntary carbon markets allow entities like corporations and individuals to buy carbon credits entirely at their discretion to offset their emissions. These markets differ from compliance markets, which feature legally binding emissions-reduction obligations, often under cap-and-trade structures like those in the European Union and California. Carbon credits are not intended to replace corporate emissions-reduction efforts; rather, they can serve as an additional mechanism to accelerate transitions to net zero, offset unavoidable emissions, and direct capital to regions with insufficient local investment.

Although still relatively immature, voluntary carbon markets have grown considerably--in 2022, their overall value surpassed two billion dollars, a fourfold increase from 2020, and African credits have grown 36 percent on average over the last five years. However, this rapid growth coupled with a lack of underlying structure has led to various issues, including concerns about the quality and legitimacy of many carbon credits sold, which cast doubt on the credits' actual contributions to climate-change mitigation and stall market growth. Additionally, some carbon credits, which are primarily purchased by corporations based in the Global North, have hindered development in the Global South. For example, some governments in the Global South have forced local communities to sell land for the purpose of creating carbon credits. Organizations such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market are working to solve the various issues related to the voluntary carbon market; in March, it released the first part of its "Core Carbon Principles," outlining standards around carbon credits to ensure that offset efforts create verifiable impact.

Carbon-credit prices currently lack standardization, with prices being determined by the type or specific characteristics of the credits. They typically range from under four dollars per ton for lower-quality credits, often renewable energy projects, to over one hundred dollars for higher-quality credits, mainly tons removed from the atmosphere through carbon-removal technologies such as direct air capture. However, with large-scale removal technology still in development stages, removal projects accounted for just 3 percent of all projects issuing credits in 2022. In recent years, low-priced or "junk" credits have flooded the market, enabling dozens of companies to claim carbon-neutral status while only making limited environmental impact. At the twenty-seventh United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, Kristalina Georgieva, head of the International Monetary Fund, asserted that unless carbon credits are priced on a trajectory that attains a seventy-five-dollar average price per ton by 2030, climate goals will remain out of reach. While Georgieva's comments were likely targeted at compliance markets, pricing between the two markets is inherently connected, and there's interest in formalizing that connection. By adopting thoughtful carbon-credit-purchasing strategies, including by supporting higher-quality credits that accurately reflect the value of a carbon ton, corporations can strengthen the voluntary carbon market and help it integrate it with compliance markets, rather than delegitimize it.

As rating agencies in the industry mature, corporations will need to take it upon themselves to work with these players and do their own due diligence to ensure that the carbon credits they purchase are high quality, as determined by key characteristics. For example, high-quality credits are "additional": In other words, the emission reduction would not have occurred without the offset financing activity, an increasingly difficult hurdle for renewable energy credits. A high-quality credit is also quantifiable, in that it is produced by a project that can properly track resulting emissions reductions, and brings other environmental benefits such as improving air quality or enhancing biodiversity. Corporations may need to hire teams to analyze and determine the best partners to purchase credits from or work with trusted brokers with shared values. It will require collaborating with governments, banks, and other industry players to help build the necessary infrastructure and integration with compliance markets.

Thoughtful participation comes at a price, leaving open the question of why corporations should, if not mandated, participate sincerely or meaningfully in voluntary carbon markets at all. Engaging cheaply just to claim carbon-neutral status, what many call "greenwashing," will likely become meaningless to consumers soon. While corporations may be incentivized to invest in credits to get ahead of regulatory risk or to appease investors, another often unmentioned reason is to support and grow their future consumer bases. Many opportunities for high-quality carbon credits are in the Global South, which will be disproportionately affected by climate change--and also host the largest urban centers and burgeoning middle-income populations. By the end of the century, Africa is projected to be the only continent experiencing population growth and will be home to thirteen of the world's twenty largest urban areas. India's population just surpassed China's. If the Global South is not supported in its sustainable growth, achieving climate goals will become nearly impossible, and economic environments will become less prosperous.

Instead, by purchasing high-quality carbon credits, corporations can help build a sustainable future that expands economic opportunity in the Global South. For example, corporations can purchase reduction credits by supporting organizations like KOKO Networks, which developed a bioethanol cooker and fuel dispensary service in the hopes of transitioning the third of the world's population that currently cooks on charcoal or wood (particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia) to a less carbon-heavy and less pollutive fuel source. By integrating hardware (their cookstove) with software (data collected at their dispensaries) KOKO Networks is able to properly measure its carbon impact and issue carbon credits to account for the reduction in emissions. Other such organizations are LifeStraw, which prevents carbon-dioxide emissions generated from boiling water via wood or charcoal by offering a drinking straw that filters water, and Mauto, which recently closed a five-million-dollar transaction to deploy electric two-wheelers across Africa. While more advanced technologies for carbon removal may prove fruitful in the future, corporations should not overlook the credits available today via initiatives like these that can have an immediate impact on ensuring Africa and other regions' low- and middle-income populations grow sustainably.

Carbon-reduction credits (in contrast to carbon-removal credits) can help shift high-polluting consumer behaviors to sustainable practices in the world's fastest-growing markets. When purchasing a bioethanol cookstove or an electric vehicle is not financially feasible in African markets, the sale of carbon credits could effectively subsidize these products and make them available to consumers at competitive prices. On the individual level, a mother in Nairobi can cook cleanly in her home, improving her family's health, resulting in possibly lower medical costs or fewer days of missed work. On a larger scale, avoiding deforestation can help lessen the local impact of climate change because forests regulate weather conditions and help to avoid massive droughts or monsoons that can destroy crops and livelihoods. It is in corporations' best interest to ensure African consumers are increasingly economically advantaged, a reality that is only possible through sustainable expansion, and carbon credits serve as one tool to support this growth.

By participating in the voluntary carbon market and purchasing high-quality carbon credits, corporations can contribute to sustainable development in the urban centers of tomorrow, while serving their own business interests. Rather than turning away from carbon credits due to the difficulties involved, corporations should lean in and consider which credits can best support their future customers.

South Africa will host the BRICS summit in August 2023. The event could offer the country an opportunity to exercise leadership in the BRICS' efforts to reform the arrangements for global economic governance and in supporting sustainable and inclusive development in Africa and the Global South. However, the opportunity has morphed into an international challenge because Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court, has indicated that he will attend.

TD 
	

South Africa could face the wrath of its BRICS partners if it fulfils its international obligation and arrests him. On the other hand, if it does not arrest him, it could face sanctions from those countries that want to see Putin tried for war crimes.

Hosting the 2023 BRICS summit is therefore fraught with dangers. The international environment is complicated, dynamic and unpredictable. South Africa can avoid embarrassment and capitalise on the opportunities presented by the BRICS summit only if it is able to skilfully manoeuvre in these choppy waters._

Trying to understand South Africa's dilemma raises a number of questions: Who are the BRICS? What has the grouping achieved?

Who are the BRICS?

In 2001, the global investment bank Goldman Sachs stated that it expected Brazil, Russia, India and China to become leading actors in the global economy. It collectively named the four countries "BRICs".

These countries decided that Goldman Sachs had a point and that they could enhance their global influence if they cooperated. They first met at a ministerial level in 2006 and at a leaders' summit in 2009. In 2010 they invited South Africa to join the group. The group became known as "BRICS".

A primary objective of the group is to reform global economic governance so that it is more responsive to the concerns and interests of the Global South. For example, the BRICS have called for a new global currency that can challenge the dominant role of the US dollar in the international monetary system. It has also pushed for a greater voice - and more votes - for developing countries in key international economic organisations like the IMF and the World Bank.

The group has also sought, through groups like its business forum, to promote greater economic cooperation between the participating countries.

What has the BRICS grouping achieved?

The BRICS record of achievements is mixed.

In 2016, the group established two new international economic entities.

The first was the New Development Bank. They contend that it is a "new" multilateral development bank which offers its members an alternative to institutions like the World Bank. It claims that its governance is fairer than the World Bank because its five original members all have equal votes. At the World Bank, shares (and therefore votes) are unevenly distributed among member states.

The development bank also strives to provide financing more quickly than the World Bank, and in a way that is more respectful of the laws in its member states.

However, to date, the New Development Bank has been less transparent and accountable than other multilateral development banks.

It has provided US$32.8 billion to 96 projects in the 5 BRICS countries and it has begun looking to expand the scope of its operations.

Since 2021 it has approved membership for Bangladesh, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Uruguay. It is expected to add new members in the coming years.

The second new entity was the Contingent Reserve Arrangement. This established a series of swap arrangements between the BRICS central banks. These arrangements allow each central bank, when its country is facing a balance of payments crisis, to exchange its local currency for hard currencies, like the US dollar, with its counterparts in the BRICS.

Pursuant to the terms of the arrangement, a central bank can only draw on a fraction of the available financing without also having to enter into a financing arrangement with the IMF. Thus, the conditions that are attached to the IMF's finances also become applicable to the funds made available through the Contingent Reserve Arrangement.

To date, no BRICS central bank has used the arrangement.

According to their communiques, the BRICS leaders have agreed to create other entities, such as a vaccine centre and a new credit rating agency. However, they have not yet implemented these agreements.

They have not been successful either in reforming the existing institutions and arrangements for global economic governance, such as the IMF. One reason for this failure is the strong opposition to reform from states, primarily those in Europe, which currently have dominant voices in the IMF and would lose them in the case of true reform.

But another important reason is that the BRICS are not unified in their demands for reform. For example, while Brazil, India and South Africa support reforming the UN Security Council to include more permanent members and to eliminate the veto power of the existing permanent members, China and Russia, as sitting permanent members, don't.

Similarly, not all the other BRICS have supported South Africa's call for a third African seat on the IMF's board of directors.

Are there any downsides to BRICS membership?

The global political and economic situation has changed dramatically since 2010. These changes have created both opportunities and challenges for the BRICS.

One opportunity arises from the fact that approximately 19 countries in the Global South, including Argentina, Cuba, Iran and Saudi Arabia, have expressed an interest in joining the BRICS. It is expected that the BRICS will consider the issue of membership at their upcoming August 2023 summit.

Another opportunity arises from the growing interest around the world in having an alternative currency to the US dollar as the basis for the international financial system. The BRICS have been vocal supporters of de-dollarisation. However, given the complex economic and political relations between the BRICS member states, there is considerable scepticism about the feasibility of the BRICS developing a new global currency in the near term.

The primary challenges facing the BRICS arise from geopolitics. The war in Ukraine has created tensions within the BRICS. The participating states have been forced to balance their respect for such international law principles as self-determination, sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes with their friendly relations with Russia. In addition, the BRICS cannot escape the fallout from the growing economic and security tensions between China and the west, particularly the US.

Both these issues complicate the efforts of the other BRICS to maintain their formal non-aligned position. They also exacerbate existing tensions within the BRICS. The most important example of this is the complex and tense relationship between India and China. In recent years, they have had military skirmishes in disputed border areas. In addition, India has imposed economic constraints on Chinese companies operating in India. The two countries have refused to renew the visas of journalists from each country so that now there are almost no journalists from Chinese publications in India and vice versa.

What hangs on the summit?

South Africa faces another opportunity that is fraught with danger when it hosts the G20 in 2025. The G20, which brings together the 20 leading economic powers in the world, has called itself the "premier forum" for global economic governance. South Africa is currently the only permanent African member of the G20 and 2025 will be the first time the group is hosted by an African country.

Planning for this G20 event must begin soon because in 2024 South Africa will join India, the current G20 host, and Brazil, the 2024 G20 host in the troika that manages the G20 process. If the country does not plan carefully and effectively for this G20 event, South Africa risks emerging with a diminished reputation and its credibility shredded.

HD 	US Legislators Strip China of 'Developing Nation' Status

As signs of a new Cold War are fast emerging at the United Nations, the US continues its war of words with the People's Republic of China (PRC).

The rivalry, which extends from Russia and Taiwan to Iran and Myanmar - where the UN's two permanent members are on opposite sides of ongoing political or military conflicts- has now triggered a battle on semantics.

TD 
	

Is China, described as the world's second largest economy ranking next to the US, really a "developing nation"?

The US House of Representative unanimously passed a bill March 27 directing the Secretary of State Antony Blinken to strip the PRC of its "developing country" status in international organizations

Titled "PRC Is Not a Developing Country Act" -- the bill cleared the House in an overwhelming 415-0 vote. The legislation reads: "It should be the policy of the United States--

(1) to oppose the labeling or treatment of the People's Republic of China as a developing country in any treaty or other international agreement to which the United States is a party;

(2) to oppose the labeling or treatment of the People's Republic of China as a developing country in each international organization of which the United States is a member; and

(3) to pursue the labeling or treatment of the People's Republic of China as an upper middle-income country, high income country, or developed country in each international organization of which the United States is a member".

At the United Nations, China is closely allied with the 137-member Group of 77 (G77), the largest single coalition of "developing countries" (a group created in 1964 with 77 members).

Since China is not a formal member of the G77, the group describes itself either as "The G77 and China" or "The G77 plus China."

Ambassador Anwarul K. Chowdhury, a former Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the UN and a former UN Under-Secretary-General, told IPS the defining of a developing country is a complex challenge.

"There is no established framework or charter for defining a "developing country," he noted

According to well-respected economist Jeffrey Sachs, the current divide between the developed and developing world is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century. Some economists emphasize that the binary labeling of countries is "neither descriptive nor explanatory".

For the UN system, the G77, which provides the collective negotiating platform of the countries of the South, is in reality synonymous with nations which are identified as "developing countries, least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries and small island developing states" (SIDS).

"They are all sub-groupings of developing countries and belong to the G-77, he pointed out.

Outlining the group's history, he said, the G-77 was established in 1964 by seventy-seven developing countries, signatories of the "Joint Declaration" issued at the end of the first session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva.

Although members of the G-77 have increased to 134 countries, the original name was retained due to its historic significance. Developing countries tend to have some characteristics in common, often due to their histories or geographies, said Ambassador Chowdhury, Chairman of the Administrative and Budgetary Committee (Fifth Committee) of the UN General Assembly in 1997-98 and Chair of the Group of 27, working group of G-77, in 1982-83.

In October 1997, he said, China joined the G-77 while keeping its special identity by proposing the nomenclature as "G-77 and China". China aligns its positions on the global economic and social issues with G-77 positions for negotiating purposes.

Being the largest negotiating group in the United Nations, and in view of the mutuality of their common concerns, G-77 is not expected to agree to separate China from the current collaborative arrangements.

"And more so, if the pressure comes from the US delegation, in view of the recent resolution of the House of Representatives of the US Congress, to take away the categorization of China as a developing country", declared Ambassador Chowdhury.

In a World Bank Data Blog, Tariq Khokhar, Global Data Editor & Senior Data Scientist and Umar Serajuddin, Manager, Development Data Group, at the World Bank, point out that the IMF, in the "World Economic Outlook (WEO)" currently classify 37 countries as "Advanced Economies" and all others are considered "Emerging Market and Developing Economies" according to the WEO Statistical Annex."

The institution notes that "this classification is not based on strict criteria, economic or otherwise" and that it's done in order to "facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful method of organizing data."

The United Nations has no formal definition of developing countries, but still uses the term for monitoring purposes and classifies as many as 159 countries as developing, the authors argue.

Under the UN's current classification, all of Europe and Northern America along with Japan, Australia and New Zealand are classified as developed regions, and all other regions are developing.

The UN maintains a list of "Least Developed Countries" which are defined by accounting for GNI per capita as well as measures of human capital and economic vulnerability.

"While we can't find the first instance of "developing world" being used, what it colloquially refers to -- the group of countries that fare relatively and similarly poorly in social and economic measures -- hasn't been consistently or precisely defined, and this "definition" hasn't been updated."

"The World Bank has for many years referred to "low and middle income countries" as "developing countries" for convenience in publications, but even if this definition was reasonable in the past, it's worth asking if it has remained so and if a more granular definition is warranted."

In its legislation, the US House of Representatives says "not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report identifying all current treaty negotiations in which--

(a) Any international organization of which the United States and the People's Republic of China are both current member states, the Secretary, in coordination with the heads of other Federal agencies and departments as needed, shall pursue--

(1) changing the status of the People's Republic of China from developing country to upper middle income country, high income country, or developed country if a mechanism exists in such organization to make such a change in status;

(2) proposing the development of a mechanism described in paragraph (1) to change the status of the People's Republic of China in such organization from developing country to developed country; or

(3) regardless of efforts made pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2), working to ensure that the People's Republic of China does not receive preferential treatment or assistance within the organization as a result of it having the status of a developing country.

(b) The President may waive the application of subsection (a) with respect to any international organization if the President notifies the appropriate committees of Congress, not later than 10 days before the date on which the waiver shall take effect, that such a waiver is in the national interests of the United States.

Speaking during the debate, Representative Young Kim (Republican of California) said: "The People's Republic of China is the world's second largest economy, accounting for 18.6 percent of the global economy."

"Their economy is second only to that of the United States. The United States is treated as a developed country, so should PRC," Kim said. "And is also treated as a high-income country in treaties and international organizations, so China should also be treated as a developed country."

"However, the PRC is classified as a developing country, and they're using this status to game the system and hurt countries that are truly in need," she added.

Elaborating further, Ambassador Chowdhury said the World Bank, as a part of the Bretton Woods institutions, classifies the world's economies into four groups, based on gross national income per capita: high, upper-middle, lower-middle, and low income countries.

In 2015, the World Bank declared that the "developing/developed world categorization" had become less relevant and that they will phase out the use of that descriptor.

Instead, their reports will present data aggregations for regions and income groups.

The World Trade Organisation (WTO) accepts any country's claim of itself being "developing".

He said certain countries that have become "developed" in the last 20 years by almost all economic metrics, still wants to be classified as "developing country", as it entitles them to a preferential treatment at the WTO - countries such as Brunei, Kuwait, Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates.

The term "Global South", used by some as an alternative term to developing countries, began to be mentioned more widely since about 2004.

The Global South refers to these countries' interconnected histories of cafolonialism, neo-imperialism, and differential economic and social change through which large inequalities in living standards, life expectancy, and access to resources are maintained.

"Most of humanity resides in the Global South," declared Ambassador Chowdhury.

HD 	Call for Vaccine Equity So Covid 'Mistakes' Are Not Repeated

More than 130 leaders are urging western countries in particular to do more to ensure vaccines can be distributed globally. Both now, with an end to COVID "within our grasp," and in future pandemics.

A group of world leaders and activists have called for urgent action to vaccinate low and middle-income countries to bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic.

TD 
	

The letter from The People's Vaccine NGO alliance calls for large-scale investments to develop scientific innovation and manufacturing capacity in the global south. This will ensure that vaccines and treatments can be quickly developed and rolled out in all regions, also in future pandemics, they say.

This follows an unprecedented bid during the COVID pandemic, spearheaded by India, to waive the patents for COVID vaccines and enable cheaper production in the global south. To the surprise of many observers, the US signalled a willingness, but European countries and in no small part Germany torpedoed the idea.

The former world leaders, Nobel laureates, scientists, economists, humanitarians, faith leaders, business leaders, trade unionists, and celebrities are urging world leaders to unite behind a People's vaccine based on equity and solidarity.

They argue that the COVID-19 vaccines should be accessible to everyone, everywhere and free from patents and profiteering.

What are the contents of the open letter?

The letter criticizes the massive inequality witnessed during the response to the global pandemic.

The pandemic has so far claimed 7 million lives worldwide although the true toll is believed to be higher.

"Decisions made now will determine how the world prepares for and responds to future global crises," the letter reads. "World leaders must reflect on mistakes made in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic so that they are never repeated."

With the end of the pandemic in sight, "the world is at a critical juncture," they wrote.

"We must recapture the spirit of solidarity to end the suffering and create a better future. That starts now with ending callous pharmaceutical monopolies on COVID-19 vaccines, so Africa and the world can tackle this crisis and the next," former Malawian President Joyce Banda, one of several senior African politicians to sign the letter, said.

The letter was published on the second anniversary of the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic.

The letter further condemns world leaders' approach as being "immoral, entirely self-defeating and also an ethical, economic and epidemiological failure."

The alliance warns that leaving billions of people unvaccinated increases the risk of more dangerous variants of COVID-19 emergine.

First World under heavy criticism

According to Ban Ki-Moon, signatory and former Secretary General of the United Nations, "rich country leaders are protecting pharmaceutical monopolies on COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics over the health of billions of people."

The leaders criticize the European Union, the United Kingdom,Germany, and Switzerlandfor continuing "to block the lifting of intellectual property rules which would enable the redistribution and scale-up of Covid-19 vaccine, test and treatment manufacturing in the global south."

The letter insists that "these are the people's vaccines, the people's tests and the people's treatments."

Failure to meet global vaccination targets ha been blamed on "self-defeating nationalism, pharmaceutical monopolies and inequality," according to the leaders.

South Africa and India proposed an intellectual property waiverduring the World Trade Organization (WTO) in October 2020 and are being supported by more than 100 countries including the U.S.

Despite the rallying call to waive intellectual property rights of the vaccines, strong European opposition led by the UK and Germany has prevented the WTO from reaching a consensus.

According to Winnie Byanyima, Executive Durector of UNAIDS, "the heartbreaking tragedy of our era is that the remarkable innovations of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments have been withheld from so many... Please support developing countries to vaccinate everyone everywhere. A people's vaccine."

Other signatories to the open letter include Tanzanian President H.E. Samia Suluhu Hassan, Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Charlize Theron, and Paul Polman, the former CEO of Uniliver, among others.

HD 	How White Saviourism Harms International Development

A little while ago, two comedians on a late-night show poked fun of the "white saviour complex." It's the idea that people of colour, whether in the Global South or in the West, need "saving" from a white western person or aid worker.

The comedians, Seth Meyers and Amber Ruffin, were talking about representation in movies, but the issue of white saviourism and colonial attitudes, especially in international development, is very real.

TD 
	

Accusations of white saviourism often include a story about white international volunteers taking selfies with Black children. However, such voyeuristic tourism is just the tip of the iceberg.

White saviourism - in theory and practice

These conversations are not new. More than a decade ago, writer Teju Cole defined the white saviour mentality as "an emotional experience that validates privilege." Cole described white saviourism as an intricate web of North/South power relations that involve for example American-backed coups and western interests in Africa.

Cole discusses a now infamous social media campaign and documentary, #Kony2012 led by the American organization Invisible Children and its founder Jason Russell. #Kony2012 focused on the importance of arresting the Ugandan militant Joseph Kony, then the No. 1 war criminal for the International Criminal Court.

The impulse behind Russell's short documentary was that western populations did not know about Kony and that the conflict would resolve itself if they knew. It was based on Russell's quest to help Ugandans. "Everything in my heart told me to do something," Russell said in the movie. But Russell never went into depth with expert sources and he did not offer real potential solutions to the conflict.

Ugandan writer Rosebell Kagumire says white saviour narratives often lessen the complexity of African socio-political situations. In so doing, they also ignore the role of western countries in encouraging inequalities and wars in the Global South.

Aid workers in unequal power structures

Scholars have described aid workers as "missionaries of development" who represent a system supported by individuals with good intentions who avoid criticizing capitalist mechanisms of exploitation.

This paradox means that our economic system continues to exploit Global South populations for private gains, while international organizations try to help with localized development interventions. All this is undergirded by the western self-perception that westerners are more capable, intelligent and thus more "developed."

White saviourism is thus both a state of mind and a concrete unequal power structure between the Global North and the Global South based on white supremacy and exploitation.

As Frantz Fanon said in the Wretched of the Earth, white people's subjectivity is always confirmed, whereas non-whites are victimized. Indeed, most initiatives by European and western donors to address inequality in the non-western world thrive on the assumption that the latter cannot manage themselves and that only external "white saviours" can put things in order.

Common threads

As development practitioners and scholars from three countries (Uganda, Pakistan, and Canada) who have witnessed these issues within our fields, we decided to invite those impacted by white saviourism to voice their understandings of it.

We discussed the issue with 15 people from the Global South with diverse professional backgrounds. They talked about their scholarship and lived experience of white saviourism in international development.

In our conversations and then in our edited volume, White Saviorism in International Development: Theories, Practices and Lived Experiences, we found several common threads of white saviourism.

The contributors described the many woes of the international development industry: its racist tendencies, colonial attitudes, lack of accountability, lack of respect for its subjects and the lack of inclusion of those it works with and its attitude of superiority over others.

These include the continued dispossession of Indigenous people from their lands; the role that white women play in white saviourism; the perpetuation of the saviour complex by "Brown" saviours who take on the mantle in their own countries; how organizations of the Global North steal space from those in the Global South -- a space that is not their own.

Today's buzz-worthy phrase: 'Decolonizing aid'

The goal, "decolonizing aid," has become buzz-worthy in recent years and organizations, activists and civil society organizations have set up task forces, and indexes, published reports here and there about this issue. They have recorded podcasts, listed tons of resources, organized conferences and written books and articles.

Read more: Why it's time to end child sponsorship

But as international development practitioner and researcher Themrise Khan points out, racism does not only exist within aid: it's the structure the sector is built on.

To tackle that racism and "decolonize aid," international development practitioners and scholars first need to understand the structure of white supremacy it is based on. This does not mean North/South solidarity should not exist, but that we need to reinvent its foundations.

Global South observers have voiced this same criticism for decades now, but western organizations and individuals have been slow to hear them.

International involvement in Haiti is a seminal example of this contradiction, as Rose Esther Sincimat Fleurant indicates in her chapter in our book.

On the one hand, the country was founded on the freedom of previously enslaved peoples, who were then economically annihilated over time with the enforced debt reimbursement to France for their independence and the United States occupation from 1915 to 1934. On the other hand, when an earthquake strikes, western populations and governments send money and NGOs, while accusing the Haitian government of corruption.

The road to change

To disrupt these legacies of colonial inequalities (not to use the "decolonial" buzzword), Global South aid workers need to take more control.

Our book documents and critically analyzes the actions of global aid organizations: it is one step towards dismantling the structure of white saviourism. But it will definitely not end there.

Themrise Khan from the International Institute for Migration and Development contributed to the writing of this article.

HD 	The Case for Criminalizing Ecocide

Genocide, war crimes, aggression, ecocide, crimes against humanity - which is the odd one out? The right answer is ecocide - destroying, polluting or damaging the natural living world on a large scale is not among the crimes that can be prosecuted at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

So ecocide, which literally means to "kill one's home", can take place constantly in much of the world at the moment and no one is held responsible.

TD 
	

Deforestation, oil spills, air contamination - the corporations behind episodes of severe environmental harm like this may sometimes be sued, and occasionally fined, but they can simply budget for this. No one gets arrested, so there is no real disincentive.

A growing global network of lawyers, diplomats and activists are campaigning to rectify this and have ecocide join this exclusive club of 'crimes against peace' that the International Criminal Court can punish in order to make the perpetrators liable to prosecution.

"We call ecocide the missing crime," Sue Miller, the Head of Global Networks for the Stop Ecocide campaign, told IPS.

At the moment, it is predominantly corporations based in the Global North that are causing environmental damage in the Global South, where the rule of law is often not as strong. An International law of ecocide will not only strengthen national laws, but will also provide a court of last resort for those affected by ecocide who cannot obtain justice in their own countries

"Right now, corporations are causing serious environmental damage in pursuit of profits. Mostly they get away with it.

"If they are called to account, they may end up paying a fine, some civil damages or even possibly a bribe to make the problem go away.

"Whatever the penalty, it is monetary and can sit on the company's balance sheet as a business expense".

One of the key virtues of criminalizing ecocide is that it would give a means of redress for the peoples of the Global South who are the biggest victims of it.

"At the moment, it is predominantly corporations based in the Global North that are causing environmental damage in the Global South, where the rule of law is often not as strong," said Miller.

"An International law of ecocide will not only strengthen national laws, but will also provide a court of last resort for those affected by ecocide who cannot obtain justice in their own countries".

But, above all, it would also create a deterrent to trashing the environment that currently does not exist.

Miller believes that this would be a game-changer when it comes to business practices.

"A new crime of ecocide would place personal criminal liability on the key decision makers - the controlling minds - in most cases the company directors," she said.

"As such, an ecocide law will reach into the boardrooms where the decisions are made and act as a brake on the projects which cause the worst environmental harms.

"Faced with prosecution and possible imprisonment, company directors are likely to be far more circumspect about the projects they approve.

"Funding and insurance for potentially ecocidal projects will dry up and funds, effort and talent will be diverted into healthier, more sustainable practices.

"Whilst it will enable justice to be pursued if damage is done, more importantly, an ecocide law has the power to stop the damage happening in the first place".

Rather than being hostile to the law, Miller argues that many CEOs actually want legislation that would forbid them from making profit at the expense of the natural world.

"There is no business on a dead planet and many businesses are coming to that realisation now," she said.

"They are also realising that there are advantages to working with, rather than against, nature.

"These include: unlocking innovation; stimulating investment in new, regenerative business models; levelling the playing field for sustainable enterprise; stabilising operational and reputational risk; and providing a steer towards more sustainable business practices".

These are among the reasons that make Miller confident the drive to have ecocide criminalized will ultimately be successful, despite the power of lobbies who opposite it.

The campaign has won the backing of figures including United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Pope Francis, Greta Thunberg and Paul McCartney.

In June 2021 an independent expert panel presented its formal definition of the proposed crime of ecocide as "unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts".

When discussions were taking place for the creation of the International Criminal Court at the end of the 1990s and in the early 2000s, ecocide was one of the crimes which was going to be included alongside genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes - aggression, the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, integrity or independence of another State, did not come under its jurisdiction until 2018.

In the end, ecocide was dropped during a closed doors meeting for reasons that remain unclear.

The world today would likely be a better place if it had been in there from the start.

"If it had been in place, so many events since might not only have been punished but might not have happened at all," Miller said.

"Had ecocide law been in place it is unlikely, for example, that (former Brazilian president) Jair Bolsonaro would have been so keen to encourage destruction of the Amazon in Brazil.

"It is unlikely that corporations would now be prospecting for deep sea mining sites.

"So much of the damage we are now seeing could have been avoided".

HD 	World Leaders, Private Sector Urged to Establish an International Green Bank to Win Climate Change Battle

As the effects of climate change escalate and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and droughts become more frequent and severe, threatening lives and livelihoods, humanity is losing the climate battle.

A sharp decline in the variety and the number of both wild animals and species, severe food insecurities, high levels of malnutrition, disappearing streams, springs, and rivers in some areas, and dangerous rises in sea levels that threaten island nations are alerting the world to a climate-driven catastrophe.

TD 
	

Yet even as the world stares at unprecedented climate disasters, experts such as Hafez Ghanem caution that existing international institutions are not delivering on climate change mitigation and finance and are now calling for renewed efforts through the establishment of a Green Bank.

Ghanem, former regional Vice President of the World Bank Group and a current nonresident senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development Program at the Brookings Institution, Senior Fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, and Distinguished Fellow at the Paris School of Economics tells IPS that "the creation of a Green Bank as a new international institution to solely address climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts is long overdue."

"Everybody is looking at how to finance investments in climate change. The estimate is that USD 2 trillion is needed every year for countries in the global South alone to address climate change."

Today's development assistance, he says, is about USD 200 billion per year, "so we need to multiply that figure 10-fold and only use the funds for climate change and forget about critical social sectors such as health and education."

Choosing the climate agenda over critical social sectors or vice-versa is a lose-lose situation because they are both matters of life and death. This has led world leaders to a critical crossroads.

To meet the climate financing gaps, Ghanem says many of the developed countries are asking existing multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, to reform and invest more in climate change.

Ghanem says reforms within existing institutions will not work and recommends a different approach: the establishment of a singular international institution that concerns itself solely with climate-related matters. An institution that would be a repository for global knowledge on climate change and advice governments on climate policies.

He says a Green Bank would also develop green projects across the Global South and support their financing and implementation. As currently constituted, multilateral development banks are yet to open up space for Global South to be heard at the same level as those in the North.

At the World Bank, for instance, he says, the voting power is such that the G7 countries control 39.8 percent of the World Bank while other donors control another 14.9 percent.

"Despite the World Bank conducting most of its business in Africa, the largest ten African countries control only about 3.5 percent of its voting power. A development bank that is controlled by its borrowers is not a good idea; neither is a development bank where beneficiaries feel that they don't have enough voice," he expounds.

Ghanem further emphasizes that the absence of the private sector will continue to curtail efforts to raise much-needed funds. "I believe that the Green Bank should be a public-private partnership where private corporations, foundations, and civil society organizations are invited to participate in its capital together with sovereign states. I am calling for a tripartite approach where countries of the Global South have the same voice, same voting rights as those in the Global North and the private sector."

The need to attract much-needed funds from the private sector cannot be over-emphasized, he says as it is now, "there is no voice from the private sector because the owners of, say, the World Bank and the African Development Bank are all sovereign states."

The Green Bank would, therefore, primarily support private green investments through equity contributions, loans, and guarantees at the national, regional, or global level. The new institution would also free existing multilateral banks to direct scarce resources to social and development assistance.

This would significantly boost progress toward the delivery of critical social sectors services such as health and education, particularly in poorer, more vulnerable nations such as those classified as Least Developed Countries.

As such, the proposed Green Bank will not be in competition or opposition to existing multilateral banks but an instrument to partner with other institutions and complement their projects.

"Climate change is an external threat facing all of humanity, and all of humanity needs to unite to face it. But a major share of humanity and particularly the Global South lacks the necessary resources," he says.

"There are many international meetings and summits at which resources are pledged, but the pledges are for much less than what is needed to deal with climate change. Moreover, not all pledges materialize as actual commitments and disbursements."

As governments in the Global North face tighter budget constraints and competing interests, limiting their ability to provide much-needed finance for climate projects in the South even as climate catastrophes increase, Ghanem says a new approach in the form of a Green Bank that is a private, public partnership would be an important contribution to the solution.

HD 	When Two Elephants Fight - How the Global South Uses Non-Alignment to Avoid Great Power Rivalries

An African proverb notes that "when two elephants fight, it is the grass underneath that suffers".

Many states in the global south are, therefore, seeking to avoid getting caught in the middle of any future battles between the US and China. Instead, they are calling for a renewal of the concept of non-alignment. This was an approach employed in the 1950s by newly independent countries to balance between the two ideological power blocs of east and west during the era of the Cold War

TD 
	

The new non-alignment stance is based on a perceived need to maintain southern sovereignty, pursue socio-economic development, and benefit from powerful external partners without having to choose sides. It also comes from historical grievances during the era of slavery, colonialism and Cold War interventionism.

These grievances include unilateral American military interventions in Grenada (1983), Panama (1989) and Iraq (2003) as well as support by the US and France for autocracies in countries like Egypt, Morocco, Chad and Saudi Arabia, when it suits their interests.

Many southern governments are particularly irked by America's Manichaean division of the world into "good" democracies and "bad" autocracies. More recently, countries in the global south have highlighted north-south trade disputes and western hoarding of COVID-19 vaccines as reinforcing the unequal international system of "global apartheid".

A return of non-alignment was evident at the March 2022 UN General Assembly special session on Ukraine. Fifty-two governments from the global south did not support western sanctions against Russia. This, despite Russia's clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, which southern states have historically condemned.

Read more: Five essential reads on Russia-Africa relations

A month later, 82 southern states refused to back western efforts to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council.

These included powerful southern states such as India, Indonesia, South Africa, Ethiopia, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.

The origins of non-alignment

In 1955, a conference was held in the Indonesian city of Bandung to regain the sovereignty of Africa and Asia from western imperial rule. The summit also sought to foster global peace, promote economic and cultural cooperation, and end racial domination. Governments attending were urged to abstain from collective defence arrangements with great powers.

Six years later, in 1961, the 120-strong Non-Aligned Movement emerged. Members were required to shun military alliances such as NATO and the Warsaw Pact, as well as bilateral security treaties with great powers.

Non-alignment advocated "positive" - not passive - neutrality. States were encouraged to contribute actively to strengthening and reforming institutions such as the UN and the World Bank.

Read more: Rethinking how we look at Africa's relationship with China

India's patrician prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, is widely regarded to have been the intellectual "father of non-alignment". He regarded the concept as an insurance policy against world domination by either superpower bloc or China. He also advocated nuclear disarmament.

Indonesia's military strongman, Suharto, championed non-alignment through "regional resilience". South-east Asian states were urged to seek autonomy and prevent external powers from intervening in the region.

Egypt's charismatic prophet of Arab unity, Gamal Abdel Nasser, strongly backed the use of force in conducting wars of liberation in Algeria and southern Africa, buying arms and receiving aid from both east and west. For his part, Ghana's prophet of African unity, Kwame Nkrumah, promoted the idea of an African High Command as a common army to ward off external intervention and support Africa's liberation.

The Non-Aligned Movement, however, suffered from the problems of trying to maintain cohesion among a large, diverse group. Many countries were clearly aligned to one or other power bloc.

By the early 1980s, the group had switched its focus from east-west geo-politics to north-south geo-economics. The Non-Aligned Movement started advocating a "new international economic order". This envisaged technology and resources being transferred from the rich north to the global south in order to promote industrialisation.

The north, however, simply refused to support these efforts.

Latin America and south-east Asia

Most of the recent thinking and debates on non-alignment have occurred in Latin America and south-east Asia.

Most Latin American countries have refused to align with any major power. They have also ignored Washington's warnings to avoid doing business with China. Many have embraced Chinese infrastructure, 5G technology and digital connectivity.

Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Many of the region's states declined western requests to impose sanctions on Moscow. The return of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil - the largest and wealthiest country in the region - heralds the "second coming" (following his first presidency between 2003 and 2011) of a champion of global south solidarity.

For its part, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has shown that non-alignment has as much to do with geography as strategy. Singapore sanctioned Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Indonesia condemned the intervention but rejected sanctions. Myanmar backed the invasion while Laos and Vietnam refused to condemn Moscow's aggression.

Many ASEAN states have historically championed "declaratory non-alignment". They have used the concept largely rhetorically while, in reality, practising a promiscuous "multi-alignment". Singapore and the Philippines forged close military ties with the US; Myanmar with India; Vietnam with Russia, India, and the US; and Malaysia with Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

This is also a region in which states simultaneously embrace and fear Chinese economic assistance and military cooperation. This, while seeking to avoid any external powers dominating the region or forming exclusionary military alliances.

Strong African voices are largely absent from these non-alignment debates, and are urgently needed.

Pursuing non-alignment in Africa

Africa is the world's most insecure continent, hosting 84% of UN peacekeepers. This points to a need for a cohesive southern bloc that can produce a self-sustaining security system - Pax Africana - while promoting socio-economic development.

Read more: Peace and security in Africa: how China can help address weaknesses

Uganda aims to champion this approach when it takes over the three-year rotating chair of the Non-Aligned Movement in December 2023. Strengthening the organisation into a more cohesive bloc, while fostering unity within the global south, is a major goal of its tenure.

Uganda has strong potential allies. For example, South Africa has championed "strategic non-alignment" in the Ukraine conflict, advocating a UN-negotiated solution, while refusing to sanction its BRICS ally, Russia. It has also relentlessly courted its largest bilateral trading partner, China, whose Belt and Road Initiative and BRICS bank are building infrastructure across the global south.

Read more: South Africa and Russia: President Cyril Ramaphosa's foreign policy explained

Beijing is Africa's largest trading partner at US$254 billion, and builds a third of the continent's infrastructure.

If a new non-alignment is to be achieved in Africa, the foreign military bases of the US, France and China - and the Russian military presence - must, however, be dismantled.

At the same time the continent should continue to support the UN-led rules-based international order, condemning unilateral interventions in both Ukraine and Iraq. Pax Africana would best be served by:

*liiitag building local security capacity in close cooperation with the UN;

*liiitag promoting effective regional integration; and

*liiitag fencing off the continent from meddling external powers, while continuing to welcome trade and investment from both east and west.

In a new and unique initiative, the Government of India hosted the "Voice of Global South Summit" (virtual) on 12-13 January 2023 under the theme "Unity of Voice, Unity of Purpose."

The summit envisaged bringing together countries of the Global South to share their perspectives and priorities on a common platform.

TD 
	

125 countries, including Liberia, participated in this Summit. A dispatch from the Embassy of India near Monrovia said the inaugural session was addressed by the Prime Minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi.

The theme of the Inaugural Leaders' Session was "Voice of Global South - for Human-Centric Development" and that of the Concluding Leaders' session was "Unity of Voice-Unity of Purpose."

The summit envisaged ten sessions. Four sessions were held on 12 January 2023 while six sessions took place on 13 January 2023.

In addition, there were 8 ministerial sessions held on different fields which are Foreign Affairs, Environment, Health, Energy, Security, Education, Finance, and Commerce and Trade.

The Ministerial Session on Health took place on 13 January 2023. It was an opportunity to discuss and find solutions to health-related concerns in the Global South.

Liberia was one of the participant countries in the above Session. The other participating countries were Bhutan, Cameroon, Dominican Republic, Eswatini, Grenada, Guatemala, Malawi, Niger, Paraguay, Samoa and St. Kitts and Nevis.

Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, Health Minister of India, addressed the Session while Dr. Wilhemina Jallah, Minister of Health represented Liberia.

Dr. Mandaviya highlighted India's various initiatives to ensure quality healthcare for all.

He stated that there was a need for a 360-degree transformation of healthcare delivery pathway and infrastructure, especially in view of the unprecedented damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic across the world.

He emphasized on long term measures to build a stronger, more resilient health system that could prevent, prepare for and respond to future health-related challenges while maintaining essential health services.

On the occasion, the Minister also mentioned India's G20 Presidency and highlighted the priorities for the Presidency in line with the Global South.

He reiterated Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi's vision of shaping the priorities of G20 by not only consulting the G20 partners but also the members of the Global South.

Dr. Wilhemina Jallah, in her address, also stressed the need for strengthening the health systems to be able to respond to public emergencies and improve public health outcomes for everyone.

She stated that cooperation and partnerships among countries could contribute significantly to improve the health outcomes of a population and prepare nations to respond to public health emergencies.

She also stressed on regional cooperation as one ill-prepared country could threaten the heightened vulnerabilities of an entire region.

She emphasized that the cooperation, collaboration and cooperation were the key elements to overcome the existing challenges in the healthcare systems and build a resilient healthcare system across the world.

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has assured his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of Ghana's full support on India's well-deserved assumption of the G20 Presidency.

"Like others in this organisation, we, in Ghana are hopeful that India's presidency will consciously help to provide solutions to the development imperatives of the Global South and the rest of the world," Nana Akufo Addo stated over the weekend.

TD 
	

He was speaking at the virtual session of the Voice of The South Summit, a two-day event meant to discuss the future of partnership in view of the spiraling economic challenges which disproportionately affect countries of the Global South.

Held on the theme: "Way Forward For The Global South, Unity of Voice, Unity of Purposes" It had more than 120 heads of state and government participating in the event which was the initiative of the Prime Minister Modi and the Government of India.

President Akufo-Addo said there has never been a time where malevolent forces have combined in such a manner to bring hardships to the world, "We are indeed, operating in the most challenging and difficult of times. The interlocking challenges and the convergence of crises we face pose existential threats that require our immediate solidarity and collective action."

One of such challenges we must address collectively, he said was the issue of climate change that undoubtedly has become the defining issue of our time, which threatens the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals, as it brings in its wake significant consequences if no action was taken.

He continued: Every part of our world, today, is experiencing the drastic effects of climate change, such as severe precipitation and floods; prolonged droughts and heat waves are happening all over the world, both in the developed and developing worlds.

These manifestations of the change in weather patterns have serious security implications, which cannot be ignored stressing that "We have a sacred obligation to respond now and act decisively."

President Nana Akufo-Addo said as part of a national strategy to deal with the menace of climate change, Ghana has developed 19 policy actions in 10 priority areas to realise "our nationally determined contribution goals in the next decade, to help curb climate related issues, as well as creating a pathway to development that is sustainable and resilient to climate change."

Although, the world experienced remarkable progress in healthcare delivery in the last half of the 20th century, global health inequalities persist for instance, in some developing countries, several of which are in Africa, life expectancy is between 37 to 40 years, much lower than in most developed countries.

Also, maternal and infant mortality is high, and there is a lack of access to basic preventive and life-saving medicines, as well as high prevalence of neglected diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.

According to President Akufo-Addo, the entire world was in the grip of the largest food crisis in modern history where some 828 million people face hunger, and, since 2019, the number of people experiencing severe food insecurity has increased from 135 to 345 million.

The current structure of the UN Security Council represents a long-standing injustice toward the countries in the Global South, and the time has come to address it.

It is only through reform that the Security Council can be effective in addressing the challenges of our time. And it is only through its effectiveness at maintaining international peace and security that the Council can remain credible, legitimate and relevant.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good evening, everyone. Good to see you all. So earlier this year in South Africa, I had an opportunity to set out the administration's Strategy for Africa. And at its core, it really can be distilled to a single word, and that word is partnership. The reality is that the United States and African nations cannot deliver on any of the fundamental aspirations of our people - we can't solve any of the big challenges that we face - if we don't work together. So our approach is about what America can do with African nations and people, not for them. And that's what this summit, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, has really been all about.

TD 
	

We took full advantage of having so many leaders from African governments, businesses, civil society here in Washington to strengthen these partnerships, as was demonstrated, I think, by the robust engagement from President Biden, Vice President Harris, and a large number of our Cabinet secretaries throughout the course of the week. And as you've heard, we're putting considerable new resources toward advancing our shared priorities, $55 billion over the next three years alone.

So let me just take a minute to sum up and highlight a few of those key areas that have come out of the summit. But let me start by saying the bottom line is this: We made significant, tangible progress across every one of our priorities this week, building on the momentum that we've generated over the past two years. We committed to ensuring African countries have a prominent seat at the table. Wherever consequential decisions are being made, consequential issues discussed, we've delivered on that. At the United Nations General Assembly in September, you heard President Biden express support for adding a permanent member from Africa to the UN Security Council. And this week the President announced support for the Africa Union to join the G20 as a permanent member.

In our strategy, we also committed to expanding broad-based economic opportunity in Africa in part by mobilizing the unmatched power of the American private sector. If you go back to 2021, our government has helped close more than 800 two-way trade and investment deals across 47 African countries worth $18 billion. During the summit just this week, President Biden announced more than $15 billion in new deals. At the U.S.-African Business Forum, we brought together leaders from over 300 American and African companies with the heads of the 50 delegations, fostering new connections that will create even more opportunity.

Seizing 21st century opportunities requires digital connectivity. This is vital to the free flow of ideas, information, investment. That's why the President announced our plan to work with Congress to invest more than $350 million toward a new initiative on digital transformation with Africa.

Too often, international infrastructure and trade deals are opaque. They're coercive. They lead to projects that are environmentally destructive, poorly built, that import or abuse workers, that foster corruption and burden countries with unmanageable debt. We have a different approach. We offer investments that are transparent, high-quality, and sustainable for the planet. We empower local communities. We respect the rights of their people. We listen to their people, to their needs.

America will not dictate Africa's choices. Neither should anyone else. The right to make these choices belongs to Africans and Africans alone. But we will work relentlessly to expand their choices, and the agreements and investments we made this week showed that when African governments, businesses, and communities are offered the choice to partner with the United States, they will take it.

The U.S. Strategy for Africa also committed us to help our partners recover from the devastation wrought by COVID-19 and the unprecedented global food security crisis. African countries have consistently made clear that as much as emergency assistance - in fact, even more than emergency assistance - what they want is to strengthen African capabilities, institutions, technology, supply chains, and industries so that they're more resilient in the face of future shocks, and together we are building that very resilience.

On health security, we've provided 231 million doses of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines to African countries free of charge. At the summit, President Biden committed to investing at least $4 billion by 2025 to help African countries train and equip health care workers to meet citizens' needs. We're also expanding the capacity of African countries to manufacture vaccines, tests, and therapeutics in Africa for Africans, and indeed, for the world beyond.

On food insecurity, we've provided more than $11 billion over the last year to address global hunger and improve nutrition. Much of this assistance has gone to African countries, which have been disproportionately impacted by the drivers of hunger - COVID, climate, and conflict, and by President Putin's war on Ukraine, which has made a serious crisis much worse. We're making unprecedented investments to help African countries fulfill their goal of not only being able to feed their own people but those around the world. Sixteen of the 20 partners in the Feed the Future program, our flagship program to reduce malnutrition and increase food security, are in Africa, where innovations like high-yield, high-nutrition crops that can endure extreme weather are putting communities on the path to greater resilience.

Now, we know that the climate crisis is a major driver of increased food insecurity and the spread of deadly viruses. It's exacerbating tensions that can spark and spread deadly conflict. Yet as the President often points out, once-in-a-generation's opportunity to create good paying jobs for the future. That's why we committed to foster a just energy transition that can both meet the region's need for more reliable, affordable energy and, at the same time, create opportunities for businesses and workers in African countries and the United States as well.

Since January of 2021, we've dedicated massive resources toward this very goal - solar energy in Angola, wind power in Kenya, hydro-solar energy in Ghana, and a new 100 million project that the President announced to expand off-grid access to solar energy; and that's just to name a few of the initiatives and projects that we're working on. We're deepening the resilience of African communities to a changing climate through a $150 million adaptation fund, and this is critical, and you've heard the President talk about this. We have a responsibility in the United States as, historically, the largest emitter in the world - and now still the number two emitter after China - to help countries adapt, to help them build resilience.

And we are putting the resources, we're putting the technology, we're putting the technical know-how, into doing that and sharing it with our partners. We're teaming up with governments and NGOs to incentivize the protection of irreplaceable natural resources like the Congo Basin rainforest, which absorbs more carbon than is emitted by the entire continent of Africa. Finally, we committed to work with African partners to fulfill the promise of democracy. That includes helping strengthen its core pillars - the rule of law, human rights, a free press - as well as addressing some of the root causes of insecurity, which undermines the ability of democracies to actually deliver for their people.

Yesterday President Biden hosted a small group of leaders to discuss how we can help support free, fair, and credible elections in 2023 like the ones we saw in several places this year, including Kenya. As part of that discussion, the president pledged to work with Congress to provide over $165 million to support elections and good governance in Africa in the coming year. These will be key themes of the second Summit for Democracy coming up in March, where Zambia will be one of our co-hosts.

Where there are crises and conflicts, we are supporting the African leaders, the regional institutions, and citizens who are stepping up to find diplomatic solutions. That's what we've demonstrated over the last year through our diplomatic engagement in places like Chad, Ethiopia, Sudan, and eastern DRC. We know African countries face real security concerns, including terrorism and transnational organized crime. The message we sent this week is that African nations can continue to count on the United States as a partner in building more effective and accountable security forces.

So if you're keeping score - and I couldn't cover everything - there are a lot of commitments there. And we know that commitments are only as good as our ability to deliver on them. That's why we asked one of our most experienced senior diplomats, Ambassador Johnnie Carson, to return to the State Department as our special representative for the U.S-Africa Leaders Summit implementation. With nearly four decades of experience as a diplomat, deep relationships across the region, I can think of no one better to ensure that our words are actually translated into action.

Across every single one of our priorities, civil society will play a critically important role, and in particular, youth. Today the median age in Africa is 19 years old. By 2032, two in five people on this planet will be African. And the choices that rising generations make will shape the future not just for Africa but for the entire world. That's why we're investing more in Africa's emerging leaders, more than ever before. The Vice President announced that we plan to devote an additional $1.1 billion over the next three years to youth programs like the Mandela Washington Fellows, a number of whom took part in this summit, and, of course, the YALI Network, which provides tools, resources, and a virtual community for now more than 700,000 rising leaders across the continent.

Of course, a big part of that is investing in women and girls because we know that when they have the opportunity to reach their full potential, when they're empowered to lead in business and government and communities and families, all of society benefits.

The very first gathering that I took part in this week was a meeting of rising African innovators and entrepreneurs. The energy, the ingenuity of this group, its eagerness to turn so many of the problems that we face into opportunities, and to do so in partnership with the United States, is truly inspiring. It's impossible to feel cynical in their presence because they're so energized. They're so committed to serving their communities. They are so full of good ideas. And that kind of sums up the way that we feel coming out of this summit.

As the President said yesterday, we're all in on Africa's future because we know that the future of African nations and the United States is a shared one. And in what the President's called a decisive decade, that partnership is more vital than ever.

With that, happy to take some questions. Thank you.

MR PRICE: We'll start with Shaun Tandon of the AFP, please.

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Shaun, where are you? There you are.

QUESTION: (Laughter.) Good to see you. Could I just pursue in some more detail a couple of the security issues that you mentioned?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Sure.

QUESTION: DRC: You mentioned - you mentioned the DRC in your remarks. You met with President Tshisekedi. If not mistaken, you didn't meet with President Kagame. What was the reason for not meeting with him? Does that indicate any sort of pessimism with controlling the M23 situation in the eastern DRC?

Ethiopia: You did meet with Prime Minister Abiy. How do you see the Pretoria agreement going forward? The fact that you met with him, does that show that he - that Prime Minister Abiy is back in U.S. good graces? Could there be discussion perhaps of renewing AGOA membership for Ethiopia?

And if I could just pursue AGOA a bit more broadly as well, you - the President talked about a U.S. MOU with the nascent free trade agreement of Africa. What does that mean for AGOA? I mean, should African leaders presume that AGOA is finished after 2025? Thanks.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Great. Shaun, thank you very much. Let me say this a little bit more broadly before addressing the specific conflicts that you point to. As I said a moment ago, the approach that we've taken - actually from day one of this administration - has been to support and empower African-led solutions to challenges the continent faces, including the conflicts that you've alluded to.

And from day one - whether it's Ethiopia, eastern DRC, Somalia, Sudan - the State Department has been deeply engaged and we've lent our support, our assistance to the African Union, to the EAC, to other regional groupings, to individual countries to try to help solve these challenges. That's been the approach we've taken. We believe that whenever and wherever we can find African-led solutions to these challenges, we're going to be better off, they're going to be more sustainable. And I'm proud to say that our diplomats have played, I believe, important roles in helping to move some of these forward.

So with regard to Rwanda and the DRC, first of all, I spoke to President Kagame on the phone just before the summit and we had a good conversation, just as I had a chance to speak here in Washington to President Tshisekedi. And I can say this: There is a two-track approach that are - and these tracks are pretty much joined - the Nairobi Process and then the efforts that Angola is leading that led to an agreement in Luanda, where all sides made commitments to, in effect, pull back and de-escalate the situation. And that's an important agreement and, if and as it's implemented, I think it offers tremendous promise for ending the current conflict and hopefully leading to more durable stability in the eastern DRC.

Now, a big part of that is M23 genuinely pulling back, and there, we are looking to Rwanda to use its influence with M23 to encourage that and to move that forward. At the same time, any militarized nongovernmental group needs to stand down, and that includes groups like the FDLR, and we are looking for all sides to use their influence to ensure that that happens. Rwandan forces need to pull back.

So the challenge now is implementation of what was actually agreed, and that's what we're working on with the leaders in question, but also, critically, with those who are playing a leading role in trying to reduce tensions and resolve conflict - notably, Kenya, Angola, the EAC, et cetera.

So I have some hope that we now have an agreement and a process that can lead to that result. That's what we're working on, and we'll continue to engage directly with the president of the DRC, the president of Rwanda, and with all of the others in the region who are leading this effort.

With regard to Ethiopia, there too we have a very important cessation-of-hostilities agreement that has led, over the last few weeks, to a significant reduction in violence in Tigray, the start of humanitarian assistance getting in in significant quantities, the beginning of the restoration of services, and, we hope as well, the need to verify with international monitors that human rights abuses are no longer taking place.

Implementation of this agreement, just as with the Luanda agreement, is the critical piece. The agreement's there. We need to make sure it's implemented and that, ideally, the implementation is done as quickly and as effectively as possible. Another critical component of this agreement is for Eritrean forces to withdraw from Tigray, and we're looking to that and we're - I've had discussions with a number of the leaders who were here about the need to see that happen.

So in both of these cases, I think we have now positive foundations to try to reduce tensions, resolve conflicts, create a stronger foundation for durable peace. But these things are fragile; they demand constant engagement, constant effort. And part of what we did here in Washington this week with the relevant actors was to work on the roadmap ahead for implementing these agreements, so there'll be a lot of follow-up in the days to come.

With regard to AGOA, it's produced, I think, tremendously positive results in the time that it's been in force, and we are discussing now with all of the different stakeholders - the partner countries, the private sector, our Congress - and listening to them, learning from them about how AGOA can be as effective as possible and having these conversations as we look to see where we take it once it expires, as you said, in 2025. As to countries and their participation in AGOA, the law has clear criteria, and we simply apply the facts in any given case to the law.

MR PRICE: Anthony Osae Brown, Bloomberg Africa.

QUESTION: Hi. My name is Anthony Osae Brown from Bloomberg Africa. You mentioned protecting democracy, encouraging democracy in Africa, and one of the meetings you had yesterday with the Ghanaian Government, he raised the question of the Wagner Group being allocated a mine in Burkina Faso and basically called on the U.S. to help protect democracy in West Africa. And I'm wondering what assurances are you giving to the Ghanaian Government and to your allies in the region that you'll protect them from destabilization from the activities of the Wagner Group or mercenaries in the area.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: So a few things to be said about this. Wagner Group came up in a number of conversations over the course of this week on the margins of the summit, including, indeed, in my meeting with President Akufo-Addo of Ghana. We've heard repeated concerns that Wagner and groups that are linked to it manufacture or exploit insecurity, they threaten stability, they undermine good governance, they rob countries of mineral wealth, they violate human rights. And we've heard that and seen that again and again.

If you go back to 2017, Wagner forces have deployed to the Central African Republic, they've deployed to Mozambique, to Mali, to Libya, and at the same time we've seen disinformation campaigns that are furthering the exploitative goals that Wagner and its founder have quite literally across the continent of Africa. There are United Nations investigations that detail the targeting of minority groups, the killing of civilians in Central African Republic, in Libya, in Mali by Wagner forces. I called out Wagner recently in a report that we put out on international religious freedom for its activities in the Central African Republic.

These investigations have documented human rights abuses. They've documented recruitment and use of child soldiers. And they've also documented the exploitation of resources that Wagner engages in. And we've also seen Wagner interfere with UN peacekeeping operations, endangering peacekeepers, endangering United Nations personnel. It's a long litany of bad things.

And then the bottom line, ultimately, is this: Wherever we've seen Wagner deploy, countries find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, and less independent. That's the common denominator. That's the common story across the board, which is why it's so important that we work together with partners in Africa to make them resilient to something like the Wagner Group. We have something called the Global Fragility Act that is now being implemented in an effort to address in a very comprehensive way problems of instability so that there's not a vacuum that something like Wagner comes in and tries to fill. We're using all of the relevant tools that we have to counter its influence, everything from sanctions to exposure, some of which I've just done; bolstering state capacity, bolstering regional capacity, bolstering international cooperation. All of these things are necessary.

And the bottom line is this: What I heard in conversations this week, as I've heard in the past, is our partners in Africa tell us that they do not want their resources exploited. They don't want the human rights of their people abused. They don't want their governance undermined, and ultimately, as a result, they really don't want Wagner.

MR PRICE: Shannon Crawford, ABC News.

QUESTION: Thank you, Secretary Blinken. Through the course of the summit, you have been very careful to make the case that the administration doesn't want to force African nations to choose between the U.S. and China, but the Secretary of Defense clearly said that Beijing's influence on the continent is a destabilizing threat. Do you share that assessment?

And secondly, we heard today from the Ukrainian military that Russia is digging in for a prolonged war. Now, as you noted, the White House did commit $55 billion for Africa over the course of three years, but of course, aid to Ukraine through this 10-month conflict has already eclipsed that level. Are you confident that the U.S. can maintain support for Ukraine among members of the Global South through a drawn-out fight, levels of support that have already been described as tepid at best by some?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. First part of the question - this summit is about one thing, Africa and the relationship between the United States and Africa. It's about one region and only one region, Africa. It's not about any other region. It's not about any other country, and I think you heard that across the board this week. And I recognize people may want to turn it into something else, but sometimes a thing is just what it is, and this is the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.

And fundamentally, it's about what we are affirmatively able to bring to the table, some of which I described - the partnerships, the investments that are based on shared interests and shared values, and again, done in a way that's transparent, that's high-quality, that's sustainable, and with a focus on empowering local communities, respecting their needs, their decisions, and their rights. That is what we've been talking about for the last three days.

And in doing that, we're actually creating more opportunity, more opportunity for Africans, more opportunity for Americans - new, good-paying jobs, particularly in the green economy; infrastructure that actually connects countries and peoples, which is maybe one of the biggest needs in Africa because to realize the extraordinary potential, that connectivity is the one missing piece. We're working on that. A more educated, dynamic workforce; more effective approaches to shared challenges, particularly food insecurity, climate.

In short, what we're seeking to do is to try to help deliver on what people need. That's what this is about. And it's a fundamental challenge. Can we effectively deliver? That's the challenge for all of our countries. That's what all of these leaders were talking about this week. And our answer to that question is yes, we want to work affirmatively with you; and the answer is yes, we can deliver if we do it together.

Now, if other countries have the ability and the will to do the same thing, that's great. There's more than enough need to go around. But from our perspective, to the extent that anyone else is engaged, we just want to make sure it's a race to the top, not a race to the bottom. We want to make sure that when we're seeing investments in Africa, they're done to the highest standards. They're not piling debt on countries. They're not abusing workers or importing workers from outside. They respect the environment. They don't bring corruption with them.

If that's the case, if we have these affirmative partnerships and investments, then it's great for everyone to be involved. And ultimately, as I said, this is about choices that Africans will make, and our purpose is simply to make sure that they have a good choice. That's what this is about.

With regard to Ukraine, let me just say two things. First, I had an opportunity over the last week to spend some time on Capitol Hill - first with the Senate last week, the House actually this morning before we came to the summit - with the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and colleagues from the Treasury Department, USAID, and others. And what I heard there was continued strong bipartisan support for the efforts we're making to help Ukraine defend itself, to sustain pressure on Russia, to end its aggression, as well as to continue to strengthen our own defensive alliance, NATO.

With regard to the Global South, it's very powerful because you hear countries that are - were here in Washington this week - Ghana, Kenya, so many others - that have been the victims of imperialism in the past and who see that now happening to Ukraine by Russia, and it cuts to the core for them. They feel strongly that this is not simply a matter of what's happening to Ukrainians in Ukraine. It's a matter for all to be concerned by because it goes to the very principles that were established after two World Wars and after colonialism to try to make sure that there are rules and understandings that one country is not going to go in and change the borders of another by force; it's not going to engage in land grabs; it's not going to try to erase the identity of a country and subsume it into itself; that territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty, all of these things matter, they're meaningful, and they're especially meaningful when it comes to Africa. So we heard this again and again.

Now, having said that, it's been very important to us to demonstrate that we can run and chew gum at the same time, by which I mean this: Even as we and many other countries are trying to deal with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, we're also working on, engaging, dealing with the problems, the challenges that people are feeling around the world, and notably in the Global South, including dealing with climate, dealing with global health and their own situations, dealing with food insecurity, problems that, parenthetically, in some cases have been made worse by the Russian aggression. I think everything that comes out of these three days demonstrates that that's exactly what we're doing - that we are responding in partnership to these needs even as we're dealing with the situation in Ukraine. It is not a zero sum, and I think if you - I don't want to speak for them, but if you ask many of the countries that were here this week, I think that they have to come away, based at least on what I've heard, very - feeling very positive about the engagement of the United States on the issues that matter to them and to the lives of their people day in, day out.

MR PRICE: Guilaume Naudin, RFI.

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I wanted to have your take about the outcomes of this summit. Did it meet your expectations? Did it exceed it? And isn't the tough part starting right now, considering the last summit was eight years ago and we had to wait eight years to have another event like this, with the implementation and the follow-up of everything that was decided here?

(Via interpreter) There are many French-speaking countries here. What is your feeling and the rapport from the summit? Does the hard work start now?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: (Via interpreter) The outcome is very positive, and you're entirely right: the hardest remains to be done now, and that's always the case with a summit such as this one.

The bottom line is this: We have made significant and tangible progress across every one of the shared priorities that we had going into the summit, and I described some of them a few minutes ago. And so I don't want to repeat the - I could actually spend probably the next 15 minutes just going through the list of what we call deliverables. But just in summary, we've announced very significant commitments across the board, some of them even groundbreaking, on peace and security, on diplomacy and good governance, on trade and investment, on health, on the environment, on food security, on technology and innovation, on people-to-people connections and ties.

But to your point - and I very much agree with you - what happens over three days is very important in setting the direction, making the commitments, but it's what happens over the next 362 days that really matters. It is the follow-through. It is the implementation. And I think that was felt across the board. It's one of the reasons why the President was keen on having maybe our most experienced diplomat for Africa over the last four decades, Johnnie Carson, take on this role of doing the follow-through, doing the implementation, making sure that everything that we said we would do we're actually going to do.

Similarly, the strategy that we put out on Africa a few months ago that I had the opportunity to do in South Africa, we're in effect putting out a report card on ourselves as well as in partnership with African countries to make sure that we're making good on what we said we would do.

So that's what, I think, ultimately this needs to be judged on. I believe that the last three days were a significant success, but ultimately, the ultimate judgment has to be in the days to come, the weeks to come, the months to come, are we making good on what we said we would do? I'm convinced that we will.

And by the way, over the last couple years that I've been on this job, I've had an opportunity to travel a fair bit in Africa - Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, Algeria, Senegal, Egypt, South Africa - but as the President mentioned today, I think you're going to see a lot of us in Africa next year, including the President. So that's an opportunity as well to carry forward everything that we've done here, to continue these conversations, to continue the implementation. And I know when the President goes, when other Cabinet members go, we're going to want to be able to show that what we did and said here in Washington, we're actually carrying out.

MR PRICE: Jonathan Donkor, Ghanaian Times.

QUESTION: My question has to do with debt forgiveness. Huge investment deals and commitments have been announced over the last three days. However, many African countries are saddled with debt. Ghana, for instance, is currently undertaking a debt exchange program as part of the IMF support it's seeking. Is the Western word willing to forgive the debt owed by African countries? And how would you help the countries to prevent similar situations in the future?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah, thank you. So this is a subject, a theme that we've heard loudly and clearly here. It's not new in the sense that this has been part of the conversation for some time. And there is no doubt that the rise of unsustainable debt burdens, especially in Africa, is a tremendous challenge, and it's one that we're committed to addressing. When you look at the debt crises that we've seen, they're devastating from a humanitarian standpoint, and they can be debilitating when it comes to effective economic development and inclusive growth. So there are a number of things that we talked about and that we clearly need to move forward.

One is we need all creditors, both countries and the private sector, to work together with us to support debtor countries. It can't simply be the United States. And we've attempted to address this - for example, through the G20, through the Paris Club - as I think you know. We've also led debt reduction efforts through the - something called the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. That has provided, to date, about $75 billion in debt service relief to dozens of countries - I think nearly 40 countries - going back to 1996. Of those 40 or so countries, I think more than 30 are African countries. So there's a real focus on this.

There's a G20 initiative that suspended more than $12.9 billion worth of debt service payments owed by 48 countries. This was between May of 2020 and December of last year. So these are some of the things that we've actually been doing and working on. But I think it's also fair to say more needs to be done to prevent debt crises from emerging in the first place. That's a big part of the challenge.

And one of the things that we're especially concerned about is the growth of untransparent debt, including off-balance-sheet debt and debt that's hidden by non-disclosure agreements. So a company or a country may come in, lend the money, and part of the agreement is, no, you can't reveal the terms. And that means, among other things, that when other countries are negotiating for loans, they don't know what the terms are, the people don't know what the terms are, and countries wind up being saddled with debt that they can't possibly repay. So that transparency that we bring to everything we do, we need to see that spread around in the way that these loans are made.

And not only does this actually increase the risk of a debt crisis, but it also can prolong the duration and create barriers to actually resolving these debt burdens. So bottom line is this: We need both the creditors - again, countries, private sector, as well as the debtors - to do their part to support greater fiscal and debt transparency and try to remove the barriers that exist to that transparency.

MR PRICE: Unfortunately, we're out of time. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it.

MR PRICE: Thank you, everyone, for joining. Thank you.

HD 	A Dangerous Pesticide Isn't Being Monitored in Key Bird of Prey Populations - We're Shedding Light On That Gap

It was once regarded as a miracle chemical to protect against disease and improve global food production. The man who discovered its properties even won a Nobel Prize for medicine. But today, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is best known for its devastating effects on the environment, as well as on animal and human health.

It was first used in the second world war to protect Allied soldiers against malaria and typhus, which are spread by mosquitoes and body lice. After the war, DDT became a widely available pesticide to kill insect crops pests and insects causing disease in humans.

TD 
	

However, it became clear that DDT was toxic to more than its intended targets. Continued exposure to the chemical can cause neurological damage, endocrine disorders and reproductive failure in both humans and animals.

Awareness of this damage was in no small part due to Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, published in 1962. Silent Spring brought global attention to DDT's environmental impacts and sparked a public outcry that forced much of the developed world - the "global north" - to ban the use of DDT in the 1970s and 1980s.

In 2004 the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants - those that stay in the environment for a long time after use - was adopted by over 90 nations. DDT was among the most dangerous pesticides, industrial chemicals and by-products placed on the convention's "dirty dozen" list, and was banned in most parts of the world.

Two years later the World Health Organization recommended the restricted use of DDT to control malaria. It remains in use for this purpose in various tropical countries in Asia, Africa, and South and Central America. Its use here doesn't just put human health at risk: top predators, among them birds of prey (also referred to as raptors), are threatened too.

Birds of prey as sentinels

Birds of prey or raptors are often apex predators, sitting at the top of the food chain. As such, they can act as an "ecological baraometer", helping us gauge the health of the environment. In addition to their value as indicator species, they provide valuable ecosystem services, controlling pest animals such as rodents and removing carrion from the environment, potentially reducing the spread of disease.

Because DDT accumulates in wildlife and magnifies up the food chain many raptor populations were nearly wiped out by its use. However, this bio-accumulation also means they have the potential to serve as a useful indicator to monitor levels of DDT in the environment. Thus, raptors can be regarded as sentinels for DDT.

There has been extensive monitoring of DDT in raptors by conservation agencies and academics across the globe for the last 60 years. But no study has looked at the patterns emerging from these monitoring programmes, nor compared these patterns through space and time. Our new study fills that gap.

A global north bias

We found that DDT monitoring in raptors is heavily biased toward the global north. Europe and North America account for 95% of samples. This is a concern because most DDT use is currently in the global south, as are most raptor species.

We found that DDT has been measured in over 27,000 raptors across more than 100 species. The numbers of birds sampled peaked in the 1960s and 1970s, an increase that coincided with international concern surrounding DDT.

However, just three species account for half of all raptor samples collected: bald eagle, Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon. Only the peregrine falcon occurs on all continents, but have been sampled far less in Africa, Asia, Central and South America than Europe and North America. The Eurasian sparrowhawk is also found in Asia but similar to the peregrine has been sampled far less frequently there than in Europe.

The geographical one-sidedness we've identified can likely be linked to a dearth of available funding, appropriate infrastructure and the necessary training in global south nations.

And it's worrying for three reasons.

First, most current DDT use is in the global south because of the chemical's role in malaria control.

Second, the region is home to most of the world's raptors. Most raptor species come from South and Southeast Asia, followed by sub-Saharan Africa and South America. The tropics in particular (mostly in the global south) display the highest raptor diversity. There are also many declines of species in these regions.

Third, many countries in the global south are notoriously poor enforcers of environmental legislation.

More gaps to fill

Even with better enforcement, global north countries are not always good at protecting their environments. It was only when peregrine falcons were wiped out from many regions of the UK and the US - in the late 1950s to mid 1960s - that their governments finally acted by banning DDT.

As more data are being gathered and collated to develop a clearer picture of DDT levels among raptors in the global south, countries in the region might learn from the US and UK measures and prepare similar programmes to start monitoring DDT levels in their raptor populations in a more systematic manner.

Our research is a critical first step in consolidating the uneven information on the global monitoring of DDT. The next step will be to compare how DDT levels in raptors from tropical regions still using DDT compare to levels in raptors from more temperate regions where DDT has long been banned. We are currently working on that research.

As more data becomes available and a clearer picture is created, we hope governments will feel compelled to act to ensure we do not face a second "Silent spring".

Debating Ideas aims to reflect the values and editorial ethos of the African Arguments book series, publishing engaged, often radical, scholarship, original and activist writing from within the African continent and beyond. It offers debates and engagements, contexts and controversies, and reviews and responses flowing from the African Arguments books.

TD 
	

India's historical interest in engaging with countries on the African continent was largely anchored in a sense of solidarity based on similar experiences of postcolonial marginality in the post-World War II global order. At the now famous Bandung Conference in 1952, where 29 countries met to discuss Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation,Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India declared that the 'tragedy of Africa is greater than that of any other continent, whether it is racial or political' and that it was the responsibility of newly independent Asian nations 'to help Africa to the best of [their] ability'.[1] As Antoinette Burton puts it, such arguments 'imagined the global south and emergent African nations as clients of Indian technological expertise and the cultural/civilisational improvement that ostensibly came with it'.[2] Indeed, the idea that India and emergent African nations were at different stages in their developmental journeys was already entrenched in Bandung and would reverberate in India's future Africa outreach.

Soon after independence, the Indian political elite began framing India as a leading representative of the Global South and a model for other postcolonial countries to emulate.What was less clear then was how India understood its normative power, that is the models of institutional development established in India that were deemed worthy of export to postcolonial geographies. From the very beginning, India prided itself as an emergent powerhouse of frugal innovation and technology, and African students were offered scholarships by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and invited to study mainly technical subjects under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) scheme. In the 1990s, three transformative events redefined India's foreign policy. First, the neoliberal reforms of 1991, which resulted in a burgeoning private sector and a rise in GDP growth, were widely hailed as a great success at home and abroad. Second, India entered the nuclear club in 1998 after successfully detonating a weapon, gaining greater negotiating clout on the global stage. Third, as the country moved towards the political right, the internal political landscape in India gradually changed, which resulted in a reorientation of societal values, institutions and geo-economic concerns.

Rather than a bounded nation-state, the Indian right largely conceives of India as a unique ancient civilisational state, which developed the capacity to regulate moral, scientific and political order better than any other civilisation. Political strategists often declare that the nation's role is that of a vishwaguru (Sanskrit: world teacher), with a global responsibility to share the benefits of the country's developmental trajectory with other nations. Against this backdrop, Southern solidarity gave away to a sense of Indian exceptionalism. Indian actors began to develop a clearer idea of what institutions and forms of technical expertise were worthy of export to other nations of the Global South. The Indian model of development, dubbed the 'Mumbai Consensus', was upheld as a viable developmental model for African nations. New Delhi claimed that this Indian alternative was radically different from the 'Beijing Consensus', the Chinese export-led, state-controlled model of growth, and the 'Washington Consensus', the American free-market model based on deregulation and privatisation of state enterprises. Indian policymakers claimed that the key elements of the Mumbai Consensus included a pluralistic democratic polity, decentralisation, a demand-driven economic landscape, an emphasis on private entrepreneurship and innovation and non-expansionist geopolitical outlook.

The model of development cooperation that has emerged in India in the past couple of decades incorporates some of the above elements. For example, New Delhi has subtly changed its stance on democracy promotion in a move to align itself with the United States and differentiate its value systems from China. Indian grassroots developmental initiatives encourage the processes of democratisation at a local level and seek to promote gender parity and the inclusion of marginalised groups in their local socio-economic milieus. The ITEC programme has also run several technical courses on election management and good governance for Africans. However, the official Indian stance continues to emphasise non-interference in the internal affairs of partner countries, and India has remained silenton the question of democracy and governance in African countries in contrast to donors from the Global North who often seek to tie aid to the improvement of human rights.

Indian thinktanks and policy circles frequently highlight the country's successful developmental experiments based on frugal innovation and how such models could potentially benefit African countries."Jugaad" in Hindi stands for "an improvised fix, a clever solution in adversity"and a well-known case of frugal innovation is the "Jaipur foot"- a cheap prosthetic limb with a wooden interior and a sponge-rubber protective exterior that takes a few hours to manufacture and costs around $80 - a small fraction of the cost of a comparable product in Europe or the United States. Another example is the MittiCool refrigerator made from terracotta clay that does not require electricity. Similar innovations have taken place in India for the delivery of low-cost healthcare including inexpensive eye surgeries. India has, moreover, exported its brand of frugal innovation to Africa by offering tele-education and tele-medicine services under the auspices of the Pan-African e-Network, inaugurated in 2009. As of 2017, 22,000 African students obtained degrees through distance learning programmes from Indian universities; 770 tele-medicine consultations were carried out annually, and 670 Continuous medical education (CME) sessions were conducted through the PAN.

Another example that New Delhi frequently highlights is improved food security resulting from the adoption of appropriate technologies and the success of its agribusiness sector. Home-grown 'triple A' (affordable, appropriate, adaptable)technologies are portrayed as being particularly useful to Africa on account of similar socio-economic and climatic conditions. India has thus consistently advertised the lessons from its Green Revolution as a sustainable solution for the African continent. In recent years, digital governance models developed in India have also been introduced to African stakeholders. These include the Aadhar biometric identification system, which uses cloud technology; the United Payments Interface (UPI) developed by the National Payments Corporation of India, which merges several bank accounts into a single platform, enabling instant mobile money transfer; and Co-Win, a government web portal developed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and administer vaccinations.

Another feature of the Indian developmental model - public-private partnerships - has attracted interest from African partners.These arrangements, where the public sector acts as an enabler of the private sector by providing conducive legal and business frameworks and financial guarantees, have often been successfully harnessed to address developmental needs within India. When New Delhi extends development assistance to African countries, it advocates the fusion of public and private stakeholders with the aim of developing local capacity in an inclusive manner. For instance, the Pan African e-Network (PAN) aimed to link several private super speciality hospitals in India with their public-funded counterparts in selected African countries. By facilitating a network of independent healthcare providers in India with potential patients in Africa, the PAN, which was funded and administered by the Indian government, aimed to improve African medical infrastructure as well as encourage private Indian healthcare providers to strengthen their outreach on the continent. This has resulted in a phenomenal rise of medical tourism from African countries to India. The recently launched 'Study in India' scheme works on a similar principle. A number of private for-profit universities are linked together in a common portal, and able to recruit international students directly, with the Indian government merely acting as the initial facilitator for their internationalisation.

India's civilisational wisdom in the form of Yoga and indigenous medicine have also received a fillip in Africa in recent years. The newly established AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) ministry seeks to popularise Indian traditional systems of medicine globally. Representatives from African countries have been invited to attend workshops on AYUSH systems and a number of scholarships are offered to African students at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. These moves point to a refashioning of India's identity as an emerging power that seamlessly, and often in a contradictory manner, fuses its prowess in modern science and traditional wisdom.

African reactions to India's outreach are mixed. An Afro barometer survey conducted in 2015 showed that the Indian model of development was the least preferred on the continent. However, some scholars conclude that India's presence in Africa is generally viewed positively, as it offers African policymakers a greater range of developmental partners. Our ongoing study confirms these perceptions. In addition, we find that India's official development cooperation initiatives have often not had the desired impact. Having studied the impact of the PAN in three African countries, we find that Indian initiatives do not adequately take African agencyinto account in their design and execution. PAN's initial successes were short-lived as the program came to be perceived as irrelevant and not designed to respond to local needs.

India continues to grow its diplomatic and political clout, and is scaling-up its Africa outreach. However, Indian policymakers cannot assume that their country's development experience provides a blueprint for African development. India's African outreach must pay greater attention to African developmental requirements and priorities and cannot rest solely on the country's normative imaginary.

HD 	World Population Hits 8 Billion Strong

The world's popu-lation will reach 8 billion in the middle of November - a testament to scien-tific breakthroughs and improvements in nutrition, public health and sanitation. But as our human family grows larger, it is also growing more divided.

Billions of people are struggling; hundreds of millions are facing hunger and even famine. Record numbers are on the move seeking opportunities and relief from debt and hardship, wars and climate disasters.

TD 
	

Unless we bridge the yawning chasm between the global haves and have-nots, we are setting ourselves up for an 8-billion-strong world filled with tensions and mis-trust, crisis and conflict.

The facts speak for themselves. A handful of billionaires control as much wealth as the poorest half of the world. The top one percent globally pocket one fifth of the world's income, while people in the richest countries can expect to live up to 30 years longer than those in the poorest. As the world has grown richer and healthier in recent decades, these inequalities have grown too.

On top of these long-term trends, the accelerating climate crisis and the unequal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are turbocharging inequalities.

We are heading straight for cli-mate catastrophe, while emissions and temperatures continue to rise. Floods, storms and droughts are devastating countries that con-tributed almost nothing to global heating.

The war in Ukraine is adding to ongoing food, energy and finance crises, hitting developing econo-mies hardest. These inequalities take their greatest toll on women and girls, and on marginalized groups that already suffer discrim-ination.

Many countries in the Global South face huge debts, increas-ing poverty and hunger, and the growing impacts of the climate crisis. They have little chance of investing in a sustainable recovery from the pandemic, the transition to renewable energy, or education and training for the digital age.

Anger and resentment against developed countries are reaching breaking points.

Toxic divisions and lack of trust are causing delays and deadlock on a host of issues, from nuclear disarmament to terrorism to global health. We must curb these damag-ing trends, repair relationships and find joint solutions to our common challenges.

The first step is acknowledging that this runaway inequality is a choice, and one that developed countries have the responsibility to reverse - starting this month at the UN climate conference in Egypt and the G20 summit in Bali.

I hope COP27 will see a historic Climate Solidarity Pact under which developed and emerging economies unite around a common strategy and combine their capac-ities and resources for the benefit of humankind. Wealthier countries must provide key emerging econ-omies with financial and technical support to transition away from fossil fuels. That is our only hope of meeting our climate goals.

I also urge leaders at COP27 to agree on a roadmap and institu-tional framework to compensate countries in the Global South for climate-related loss and damage that is already causing enormous suffering.

The G20 summit in Bali will be an opportunity to address the plight of developing countries. I have urged G20 economies to adopt a stimulus package that will provide governments of the Global South with investments and liquidity, and address debt relief and restructuring.

As we push for action on these medium-term measures, we are working non-stop with all stake-holders to ease the global food crisis.

The Black Sea Grain Initiative is an essential part of those efforts. It has helped to stabilize markets and bring food prices down. Every fraction of a percent has the potential to ease hunger and save lives.

We are also working to ensure Russian fertilizers can flow into global markets, which have been severely disrupted by the war. Fer-tilizer prices are up to three times higher than before the pandemic. Rice, the most widely consumed staple in the world, is the crop that will suffer most.

Removing the remaining obsta-cles to the exports of Russian fer-tilizers is an essential step towards global food security.

But among all these serious chal-lenges, there is some good news.

Our eight-billion-strong world could yield enormous opportu-nities for some of the poorest countries, where population growth is highest.

Relatively small investments in healthcare, education, gender equality and sustainable econom-ic development could create a virtuous circle of development and growth, transforming economies and lives.

Within a few decades, today's poorest countries could become engines of sustainable, green growth and prosperity across entire regions.

I never bet against human ingenuity, and I have enormous faith in human solidarity. In these difficult times, we would do well to remember the words of one of humanity's wisest observers, Mahatma Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need - but not everyone's greed."

This month's big global meetups must be an opportunity to start bridging divides and restoring trust, based on the equal rights and freedoms of every single member of humanity's eight-billion-strong family.

The latest annual climate conference has begun in the face of a worsening climate crisis and further retreats by rich nations following the energy crisis induced by NATO sanctions after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Copping out again

TD 
	

The 27th Conference of the Parties (COP 27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is now meeting in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November 2022.

COP27 takes place amidst worsening poverty, hunger and war, and higher prices, exacerbating many interlinked climate, environmental and socio-economic crises.

The looming world economic recession is likely to be deeper than in 2008. The likely spiral into stagflation will make addressing the climate crisis even more difficult.

Invoking the Ukraine war as pretext, governments and corporations are rushing to increase fossil fuel production to offset the deepening energy crisis.

Resources which should be deployed for climate adaptation and mitigation have been diverted for war, fossil fuel extraction and use, including resumption of shale gas 'fracking' as well as coal mining and burning.

War causes huge social and economic damage to people, society and the environment. The wars in Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere impose high costs on all, disrupting energy and food supplies, and raising prices sharply.

Russia's Ukraine incursion has provided a convenient smokescreen for a hasty return to fossil fuels, as military-industrial processes alone account for 6% of all greenhouse gases.

The future is already here

All these have worsened crises facing the world's environment and economy. The most optimistic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenario expects the 1.5°C rise above pre-industrial levels threshold for climate catastrophe to be breached by 2040.

Crossing it, the world faces risks of far more severe climate change effects on people and ecosystems, especially in the tropics and sub-tropical zone.

But the future is already upon us. Accelerating warming is already causing worse extreme weather events, ravaging economies, communities and ecosystems.

Recent floods in Pakistan displaced 33 million people. Wildfires, extreme heat, ice melt, drought, and extreme weather phenomena are already evident on many continents, causing disasters worldwide.

In 2021, the sea level rose to a record high, and is expected to continue rising. UN reports estimate women and children are 14 times more likely than adult men to die during climate disasters.

Popular sentiment is shifting, even in the US, where 'climate scepticism' is strongest. Devastation threatened by Hurricane Ida in 2021 not only revived painful memories of Katrina in 2005, but also heightened awareness of warming-related extreme weather events.

Stronger climate action needed

In international negotiations, rich nations have evaded historical responsibility for 'climate debt' by only focusing on current emissions. Hence, there is no recognition of a duty to compensate those most adversely impacted in the global South.

Last year's COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact was hailed for its call to 'phase-out' coal. This has now been quickly abandoned by Europe with the war. And for developing countries, Glasgow failed to deliver any significant progress on climate finance.

At COP27, the Egyptian presidency has proposed an additional 'loss and damage' finance facility to compensate for irreparable damage due to climate impacts.

After failing to even meet its modest climate finance promises of 2009, the rich North is dithering, pleading for further talks until 2024 to work out financing details.

Meanwhile, the G7 has muddied the waters by counter-offering its Global Shield Against Climate Risks - a disaster insurance scheme.

Get priorities right

What the world needs, instead, are rapidly promoted and implemented measures as part of a more rapid, just, internationally funded transition for the global South. This should:

- replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, including by subsidizing renewable energy generation for energy-deficient poor populations.

- promote energy-saving and efficiency measures to reduce its use and greenhouse gas emissions by at least 70% (from 1990) by 2030.

- implement a massive global public works programme, creating 'green jobs' to replace employment in 'unsustainable' industries.

- develop needed sustainable technologies, e.g., to replace corporate agricultural practices with 'agroecological' farming methods, investment and technology.

Another world is possible

Another world is possible. A massive social and political transformation is needed. But the relentless pursuit of private profit has always been at the expense of people and nature.

Greed cannot be expected to become the basis for a just solution to climate change, let alone environmental degradation, world poverty, hunger and gross inequalities.

The COP27 conference is now taking place in Sharm-al-Sheikh, an isolated, heavily policed tourist resort. Only one major road goes in and out, as if designed to keep out civil society and drown out voices from the global South.

The luxury hotels there are charging rates that have put COP27 beyond the means of many, especially climate justice activists from poorer countries. The rich and powerful arrived in over 400 private jets, making a mockery of decarbonization rhetoric.

Thus, the COP process is increasingly seen as exclusive. Without making real progress on the most important issues, it is increasingly seen as slow, irrelevant and ineffective.

Generating inadequate agreements at best, the illusion of progress thus created is dangerously misleading at worst.

By generating great expectations and false hopes, but actually delivering little, it is failing the world, even when it painstakingly achieves difficult compromises which fall short of what is needed.

Multilateralism at risk

Multilateral platforms, such as the UNFCCC, have long been expected to engage governments to cooperate in developing, implementing and enforcing solutions. With the erosion of multilateralism since the end of the Cold War, these are increasingly being bypassed.

Instead, self-appointed private interests, with means, pretend to speak for world civil society. Strapped for resources, multilateral platforms and other organizations are under pressure to forge partnerships and other forms of collaboration with them.

Thus, inadequate ostensible private solutions increasingly dominate policy discourses. Widespread fiscal deficits have generated interest in them due to the illusory prospect of private funding.

Private interests have thus gained considerable influence. Thus, the new spinmeisters of Davos and others have gained influence, offering seductively attractive, but ultimately false, often misleading and typically biased solutions.

Meanwhile, global warming has gone from bad to worse. UN Member States must stiffen the backs of multilateral organizations to do what is right and urgently needed, rather than simply going with the flow, typically of cash.

Debating Ideas aims to reflect the values and editorial ethos of the African Arguments book series, publishing engaged, often radical, scholarship, original and activist writing from within the African continent and beyond. It offers debates and engagements, contexts and controversies, and reviews and responses flowing from the African Arguments books.

TD 
	

With the goal of playing a more influential role in world affairs, a key foreign policy strategy for New Delhi has long been its aid and investment policies abroad. The African continent has always featured prominently in India's development diplomacy, given that support from African countries is crucial for India's long-standing campaign for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. As more Indian firms seek to establish a global presence, access to African markets is also important. Couched under the banner of South-South cooperation, which aims to provide a framework for collaboration between postcolonial nations at a similar stage of development, India has since independence in 1947 facilitated the exchange of knowledge, technology and experiences to Africa. Originally conceived as a partnership between equals, India's Africa strategy continues to be described by Indian officials as a 'demand-driven' exercise, with 'win-win outcomes' and 'mutual benefit' for both India and African nations. In doing so, India is careful to distance itself from the inherent hierarchies that characterise North-South cooperation and the aid architectures associated with former colonial powers.

For decades, capacity building has been at the heart of India's engagements in Africa. Scholarships were offered to students wishing to pursue university degrees as well as short-term technical training courses. Much like China, although to a much smaller extent, concessional loans for development projects disbursed directly to a recipient country have also featured prominently in India's strategy. Since the 1950s, the Indian army has been one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping efforts on the continent. But, as it sought to increase its influence overseas following neoliberal reforms in 1991, New Delhi's ideologically-charged goals gradually gave way to a more pragmatic exercise shaped increasingly by economic and geopolitical priorities. While itsignificantly scaled up its development cooperation with African countries the modalities of this exercise changed. Our ongoing study of India's growing footprint in Africa finds five major changes to this Indian model: the emergence of new financial mechanisms; the active role of business associations and private sector actors; greater involvement of civil society organisations and sub-national actors; an emphasis on triangular cooperation; and greater priority to partner with multilateral organisations.

First, new financing mechanisms developed by India in recent years are more commercial in nature as interest rates are higher and the grant element is smaller than the Lines of Credit offered in the past. The Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of India now offers Buyers' Credits to foreign governments for the purchase of additional goods and services for projects funded by India. Large public sector banks, like State Bank of Indiaand Bank of Baroda, also provide concessional finance for Indian companies to operate abroad, as well as commercial loans to a range of stakeholders in the geographies in which they operate. With the commercialisation of development finance, India's development cooperation has changed from a partnership between equals to a more hierarchical relationship between the country and its African allies.

Second, the private sector is playing a more active role. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce (FICCI) routinely lobby Indian and African governments, and are instrumental in connecting small and middle enterprises from India with stakeholders on the continent. These organisations advocate Public-Private Partnerships as the preferred modality of Indian investments and work closely with the Ministry of Commerce, EXIM Bank of India and the Ministry of External Affairs. A good example is the CII-EXIM conclave on Africa, first held in 2005, which helps Indian businesses establish and grow their footprint in Africa. While the India Africa Forum Summits (IAFSs), the official platform for strengthening India-Africa relations, have only been held on three occasions, there have been 17 business conclaves to date. Major Indian multinationals now established in African markets, such as the Tata group, Jindal and Mahindra, have developed in-house training programmes for local staff and have stepped up their Corporate Social Responsibility commitments.

Third, while India's development cooperation strategy before 1991 was largely a state-controlled exercise, non-state actors are now playing a more active role. Civil society organisations are more involved in capacity-building initiatives. While the Self-Employed Women's Organisation (SEWA) offers training modules on small-scale agriculture, Barefoot College in Rajasthan offers training in solar energy technology to their African partners. In addition, the state governments of Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat are courting African stakeholders directly in a bid to strengthen cultural and economic ties, and enhance trade and investments in sectors as diverse as agriculture and defence. This points to the rise of para-diplomacy and the decentralisation of India's African strategy, which in future may be increasingly determined by state governments and shaped by regional Indian interests.

Fourth, India, like China, is emphasising triangular cooperation, which seeks to involve a myriad of actors such as governments, CSOs and business forums, from both the Global North and Global South. Illustrative examples include the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGG), conceptualised by Japan, India and several African countries for improvements in infrastructure and digitalisation; Supporting Indian Trade and Investments in Africa (SITA) funded by the United Kingdom's Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office; and the Future India Triangular Training (FTF-ITT) Programme funded by USAID and India for agricultural research in Africa.

Fifth, India's financial contributions to the multilateral system have steadily increased from 2006 to 2018. These funds are typically channelled through regional development banks, UN agencies and the World Bank. This is in tune with India's self-perception of itself as a leader of the Global South, and also reflects the country's long-standing campaign to make the current multilateral order more inclusive of voices of developing nations.

The rise of India and China and other donors from the Global South has created a polycentric global landscape, providing African policymakers with viable alternatives to the Global North. However, we find that over the years there has been a gradual convergence of strategies, practices and rhetoric employed by northern and southern donors. While promoting models which incorporate blended finance into their aid regimes in novel ways, various Indian entities have sought to adopt technical and operational policies from the OECD/ DAC and the World Bank. In the process, India's development cooperation with the African continent has gradually become synonymous with its economic diplomacy, as foreign policy is crafted to boost trade, investment and stimulate the overseas growth of Indian industries. These changes have been accompanied by a new ideological framework, couched in the idea of Indian Exceptionalism, which is radically different from the idea of South-South cooperation. In our subsequent piece, to run also on Debating Ideas - African Arguments, we discuss how Indian Exceptionalism informs the country's African engagements and shapes its economic diplomacy approach.

Under President Xi Jinping, China's engagement with Africa reached new heights, economically and diplomatically.

During nearly 10 years in power, Xi's trademark Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) saw massive infrastructure projects rolled out across the continent, his government tripled China's financial commitments at the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held under his tenure, and also swayed more African governments to support Beijing's positions at the United Nations.

TD 
	

With Xi now set to be confirmed for a third term in power at this months' Communist Party Congress in Beijing, analysts say what happens at the meeting with Xi and other top leaders is closely followed by African governments.

"It matters very greatly and this is because the relationships with Africa ... tend to be highly personalized, so if the leader at any one particular time has a personal interest in Africa, depending on how that leader perceives the African continent, you're going to have very stable and multifaceted relations," Paul Nantulya, a China expert at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, told VOA.

Under the founder of Communist China, Mao Zedong, China and Africa had a close relationship, especially as Beijing supported liberation movements on the continent. But under his successor Deng Xiaoping, China was more focused on engaging with the West and reforms at home than on relations with Africa, Nantulya said.

"Xi Jinping has taken the China-Africa relationship to the highest level that it's ever been since the era of Mao Zedong," he said, adding that with Xi sure to get a third five-year term, and perhaps even stay in power longer, he expects those relations to strengthen even more.

Xi himself is only able to run for a third term this year because he changed the constitution in 2018 to allow for it. Some analysts say he's setting himself up to be leader for life.

"It could inspire a mood in Africa to further change or manipulate constitutions so that party leaders can remain in office, this has been a trend that we've seen unfortunately coming back on the African continent," said Nantulya.

But other analysts were less convinced that Xi accounts for the direction of China-Africa relations.

"It's hard to disentangle the impact of one individual from the broad trends of China's globalization and the shifting demand and absorptive capacity on the African side," said Deborah Brautigam, head of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University.

Cobus van Staden, a China expert at the South African Institute for International Affairs, said Beijing's engagement with Africa predates Xi and is driven by many actors.

"Xi continuing as the head of the party is significant but it doesn't, I think, fundamentally change the nature of the engagement itself," he said.

However, Van Staden noted, Xi has "refined and repackaged" the two regions' relationship, and he does define the diplomatic tenor of the engagement.

Diplomatically winning over global south

The success of China's soft power overtures in Africa have been illustrated by how many countries have followed Beijing's lead when it comes to remaining neutral on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Analysts say China certainly wants nations in the so-called global south in its ideological corner and the U.S. and Europe have been scrambling to play catch-up.

"My view is that Xi's administration has increasingly created a pro- and anti-China world, where countries divide into those who seek pragmatic relations with China for self-benefit, accept its transactional approach to diplomacy and on the whole care far less about values-issues, and then the other part of the world, largely around the U.S. and its European and other close allies, who of course do believe that values matter," Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King's College London, told VOA.

"China has become less and less interested in relations with the latter group where they involve it lecturing or seeming to speak down to China, and more aware of having a wide network of alternative relationships particularly in the global south where these issues are not part of the mix," he added.

Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies at London University, said pursuing relationships with such countries will likely remain a foreign policy priority for Beijing.

"Xi is also determined to compete against the West or the democracies, and to do so, his China will need to woo African countries, particularly the autocracies," Tsang said.

However, he noted, "under Xi, China's economy is likely to slow down, as his policies have not been helpful to growth. A slowing economy will mean less finance for the BRI and thus less money to be spent to woo African countries."

Shifts in China's Africa lending

Amid economic troubles at home and the Chinese Communist Party's unpopular "zero-COVID" policies, as well as constant allegations of "debt-trap diplomacy" from the West over China's lending, economists say lending is already down, leaving African markets vulnerable. At the last regional trade forum FOCAC in 2021, Beijing announced $20 million less in funding for the continent - could China be scaling back in Africa?

"China will never turn away from Africa, for political and economic reasons. But for the time being, the old model of infrastructure-driven financing loans appears unsustainable, given China's own economic shifts," Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, told VOA.

Already the nature of the engagement is changing, with Beijing moving away from hard infrastructure projects like roads and railways, toward investment in information and communications technology, agriculture, green energy and other areas in Africa.

Another means by which China under Xi continues to increase its soft power on the continent is through promoting its governance and party model to Africa's politicians, even starting a political party training school in Tanzania this year that some critics are worried could undermine democracies in the region.

"The training of African politicians and officials will continue despite a scaling down of the BRI," said Tsang.

HD 	Africa Should Take the Driving Seat in Its China Dealings

If the continent wants positive outcomes, it must be more hard-nosed, prepared and ruthless than China.

'China narratives in Western liberal democracies are not mainstream in the rest of the world.' This is one of the takeaways from a new report by the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies. Drawing on researchers in eight developing countries, the study tried to educate its readers in Europe about something many of them may never have considered: that China is actually pretty popular across the Global South.

TD 
	

This conclusion is hardly news for those who've followed African perceptions about China via polling outfits like Afrobarometer. Such surveys have for some time shown that China and the United States both enjoy relatively high and strikingly similar approval ratings in many African countries.

These findings sit uncomfortably with views coming from both Beijing and Western capitals. Our current polarised geopolitical moment rewards competition narratives and punishes nuance. Pundits on both sides benefit by presenting the two as complete opposites.

But there are striking similarities. Both sides present themselves as paragons of 21st century development and modernity, despite being powered by a dependence on hydrocarbons straight out of the 19th century. Both balance globe-circling ambitions with a narrow domestic political focus that ends at the borders of the nation state.

This means both sides' rhetoric of aiding universal development needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. And of course, despite both the West and China rejecting the language of 'choosing sides', they would dearly like the Global South to choose sides - preferably theirs.

China and the US both enjoy relatively high, and similar, approval ratings in many African countries

Africa can gain from playing the sides off each other. But to do that, it needs to decide what it wants and what both sides can offer - especially in relation to China.

This is because Western power is already well known in Africa, and its ability to offer incentives could be plateauing. Western influence is emerging from a golden age of low interest rates, and low consumer prices and inflation, partly due to China's long reign as a low-wage manufacturer. That window is now closing. Western powers didn't use this opportunity to transition to more sustainable energy solutions, even as their middle class was hollowed out by offshoring and financialisation.

The result is staring politicians like United Kingdom Prime Minister Liz Truss in the face: sky-high energy prices due to the Ukraine crisis melding with a rapidly escalating climate crisis and a squeezed and resentful electorate.

No matter the rhetoric, selling Africa-focused infrastructure initiatives like the G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment to voters in this climate will be tough. Western powers may still emerge as the game-changing infrastructure-funding development partners promised in these initiatives, but probably not soon.

Africa can gain from playing the West and China off each other, but needs to decide what it wants

With an economic slowdown and a rapidly ageing population, similar constraints are emerging in China. But there are key differences. First, the political will behind the Belt and Road Initiative overlaps significantly with the agenda of China's private sector. The initiative aims to diversify sources of strategic commodities, export excess industrial capacity by finding new markets and build political alliances across the Global South. This overlap isn't necessarily true in the West, where governments and conglomerates often pull in different directions.

Chinese companies' skill sets are also frequently aligned with African realities. From building data networks in rural territories to selling cut-price cellphones, Chinese firms have honed in on African demand and found ways to provide at price points that frequently exclude competitors.

More broadly, China's perceptions of Africa are filtered through its own development trajectory from poor backwater to global giant. This often translates into bullish views of African countries that some Western observers would write off as basket cases.

However, for Africa to gain from its relationship with China, it needs to face a few hard facts. First, China is in it for itself. Second, many Chinese actors are equally happy to fund/sell good products and bad products. The responsibility for getting the development-boosting infrastructure or appropriate technology Africa wants, lies squarely with Africans themselves.

Africa's story could be about pioneering new forms of energy and development that alter the course of history

Bluntly put: if Africa wants positive outcomes from China, it needs to be more hard-nosed, prepared and ruthless than the Chinese. This means coming to the negotiating table with the same international legal teams as Chinese contractors. It means being uncompromising in contract language and willing to walk away from deals if they don't serve inclusive development goals. It also means cracking down on any labour or environmental abuses by foreign companies.

To drive these bargains, African countries need to build a base of technocrats, cherish and include their civil society and youth contingents in project planning, and beef up the implementation of their own laws. It also means going after corrupt officials, publishing all loan contracts and working with neighbouring states to coordinate development plans rather than allowing Chinese entities to play them off against each other.

In broader terms, it means putting Africa at the centre of the African story. The continent should also withdraw its buy-in of geopolitical 'New Cold War' narratives and only indulge these powers to the extent that they serve African purposes. But that means knowing what African purposes are - not only in broad terms but in detail.

The current tensions between China and Western countries play out as competing narratives. If Africa doesn't come up with its own narrative, it will be condemned to being a bit player in someone else's story. That would be a shame. With the world's youngest population, Africa's story could be about how a continent of talented young people pioneered new forms of energy and development that radically altered the course of history.

That story is much more compelling than the arid coal-and-oil-and-geopolitics yarns spun by Beijing and Washington.

African delegations must demand loss and damage reparations, that fossil fuels stay in the ground, and that false solution are abandoned.

TD 
	

Climate change remains Africa's biggest "existential challenge" and we are already experiencing its effects. Cyclone Batsirai displaced 150,000 people in Madagascar this February, compounding the effects of the country's worst drought in 40 years. The "Durban Rain Bomb" in April caused flooding across KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, destroying thousands of homes. Dust storms are wreaking havoc in the Sahel region. And millions are at risk of starvation in the Horn of Africa following four years of failed rains. Climate breakdown has also undermined food security for hundreds of millions of people and fuelled violent conflict.

Challenges related to climate change are being faced around the world, of course, including in the form of unprecedented heatwaves, floods, and droughts. But in the Global South, these effects are being experienced amid low capacity for climate adaptation. In Africa, the large-scale plunder of natural resources to meet the overconsumption of elites has resulted in increased poverty. Industrial agriculture, forestry, and fishing have pushed ecological systems to the brink of destruction and undermined local development.

The upcoming COP27 has added focus on Africa's climate vulnerability as well as the Global North's non-commitment on its UNFCCC pledges. The "just transition" narrative is finally being recognised by governments after years of community struggles.

At the same time, however, we are experiencing a stronger push towards the entrenchment of dirty energy colonialism. Fossil fuel operations are expanding in South Africa; oil and gas is being explored in Zimbabwe and Ivory Coast; offshore reserves are being further exploited in Nigeria and Mozambique to mention just a few examples. Furthermore, the war in Ukraine has recently prompted a new push for extractivism. Countries in the Global North are encouraging investment in fossil fuels in Africa - where $400 billion worth of new natural gas projects are underway - while simultaneously giving lip service to the idea of phasing down oil and gas.

Growing evidence shows that this exploitation will not bring long-term benefits to the continent. The only winners will be rich countries and transnational corporations looking to make huge profits. These oil and gas companies are planning 195 gigantic oil projects around the world that will produce 646 gigatons of borderless CO2 emissions that will impact us all and drive us past internationally agreed temperature limits. While these "carbon bombs" are being pursued, countries and corporations in the Global North are also pushing false solutions such as carbon markets, carbon offsetting, the idea of "net zero", and geoengineering.

Against this backdrop, we are calling on our African Delegation to push for the following outcomes at at COP27, on 6-18 November:

Climate financing should be increased to meet the set targets. It should be in the form of grants and without debt. It should be targeted towards the most vulnerable communities at the frontline of the climate crisis in Africa including rural women food producers.

Clear commitments should be made on loss and damage reparations. We must ensure the historical polluter pays. Large polluters owe a huge climate debt that must be honoured and paid to oppressed indigenous and other communities in Africa and the Global South according to how the climate crisis is impacting them. The Global North must fairly and justly compensate for the loss and damage experienced by those who are most vulnerable and least responsible for the destruction of their environments. There is a need to move from an open-ended negotiating platform on loss and damage to an emergency facility with accountability frameworks.

Peasant agroecology and other sustainable food production and distribution models grounded in food sovereignty should be recognised, respected and supported as alternatives to the industrialist food system. Governments should increase national budget allocations to agriculture and protect local seeds and seed systems, guided by the principle of Free, Prior and Informed (and Continuous) Consent by small-scale food producers and consumers.

Rich countries must end their climate hypocrisy, and false solutions should be abandoned, including "net zero", failed emissions trading and offsetting mechanisms, and techno-fixes such as geo-engineering and genetic modification. Nuclear energy, big dams, and "Green" and "Blue" Economy models must be called out as scams and abolished.

Governments and financiers must commit to leave fossil fuels in the ground and stop all new exploration. Our governments should redirect existing reserves to phasing out fossil fuels and commit to a just energy transition.

We must focus on transforming our energy system. Ideas like energy sufficiency for all, energy sovereignty, energy democracy, energy as a common good, 100% renewable energy for all, and community-owned renewable energy can help us urgently transition to a way of living that is just and in harmony with nature.

The Global North must stop its waste colonialism of dumping waste in the Global South. All parties must commit to exclude waste-to-energy incineration from climate plans. Governments must stop petrochemical expansion, reduce plastic production, and phase-out single-use plastic and packaging. They must invest waste reduction measures and zero waste circular economy systems. Polluting companies should be made accountable for plastic pollution and their enormous contribution to global warming in line with the "producer pays" principle.

In line with the UN declarations on the Rights of Peasants and Indigenous People's Rights, COP27 must respect and uphold the rights of people in the face of climate injustice. National legal frameworks should be revised to reflect this and strengthen women's rights and protection from violence. We stand in solidarity with Cabo Delgado in Mozambique, Okavango in Namibia, and all communities and territories affected by conflicts and resource wars, as well as all those affected by the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) and the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP). Actions that perpetuate injustice, further exploitation of natural resources, and displace communities in the false name of the climate must make way for an equitable and just transition in energy, agriculture and mining.

A new Africa is possible. We need climate justice now.

This is an abridged version of the ACJC's full Africa People's Counter COP27 Declaration.

The Africa Climate Justice Collective (ACJC) is a group of African civil society organisations, movements of women, peasant communities, African citizens and more, that is fighting for climate justice and standing in solidarity with the people of the world, especially those in the front lines of the impacts of the climate crisis.

HD 	Climate Change Crisis - Glasgow Team, Climate Activists Accuse World Bank of Providing $12bn for Fossil Fuels Projects in 35 Countries

Ahead of Conference of the Parties, COP27, in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, a nonprofit organization, Glasgow Team and climate activists accuse World Bank of providing $12bn for fossil fuels projects in 35 countries, which had massively contributed to climate change.

This was stated at press a conference held via webinar, with theme 'World Bank's investment in Carbon Capture in Nigeria in Commemoration of 2022 World Habitat Day' where they condemned what they described as false narrative that fossil fuels will bring prosperity.

TD 
	

They said is a harmful distraction from the actual demands of Global South citizens, especially Africans, who want clean, community owned energy.

And further stated that also harmful is the Net Zero lie that "Big Polluters use to continue polluting" while promising unrealistic tree planting schemes that could only feasibly lead to land grabbing.

According them, the World Bank is a major investor of public money into energy projects and sets the norms for other multilateral lenders and crowds in private finance, so it is essential that those running the World Bank acknowledge the real-world impacts of its funding.

Glasgow Action Team is a coalition of civil society organisations/ charities working for climate justice.

Reading the address, Climate activist, Jake Hess, on behalf of others said, "This year's World Habitat Day seeks to draw attention to the growing inequalities and vulnerabilities that have been exacerbated by the triple 'C' crises -- COVID-19, Climate and Conflict, and this is why we have converged here today to call on the World Bank to move from rhetoric to action, and reform its climate policy.

"The World Bank was set up after World War Two to rebuild economies and its stated goals are to end extreme poverty by 2030 and increase prosperity.

"The Bank's failure to tackle climate change is the latest challenge where the Bank has come short and failed to deliver for low-income countries.

"Since the Paris Agreement, the World Bank has provided $12 billion in direct project finance to fossil fuels projects in 35 countries, more than any other multilateral development bank, according to civil society estimates.

"The figure does not include billions more in support of fossil fuels through financial intermediaries, the biggest culprit being the commercial lending arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

"The false narrative that fossil fuels will bring prosperity is a harmful distraction from the actual demands of Global South citizens, especially Africans, who want clean, community owned energy. Also harmful is the Net Zero lie that Big Polluters use to continue polluting while promising unrealistic tree planting schemes that could only feasibly lead to land grabs.

"The World Bank is operating with impunity. The vast proportion of the World Bank's lending and other programme portfolios remain immune from legal action, as does the IMF. This means that its contradictions are not held accountable.

"For example, it continues to invest in fossil fuels which are driving climate change, at the same time as investing in trying to fix the problems caused by climate change, such as investing $10 million into reversing degradation of Lake Chad."

Meanwhile, speaking about their concern about the World Bank's announcement of funding for carbon capture in Nigeria.

"In Nigeria, a current major concern is that the Bank has announced funding for Carbon Capture and Storage, a controversial and unproven technology that claims to store carbon underground, to 'help Nigeria reach its emissions targets', despite criticisms that this techno-fix reinforces fossil fuel dependence.

"The project is geared toward research and piloting.

In his speech at the last UN Climate talks, President Buhari announced that Nigeria would become net zero by 2060, saying "the government is looking for partners, technology, and finance to make cleaner and efficient use of all available resources for a more stable transition in energy markets".

They also warned that, "But it's crucial that the technologies are scientifically proven, given the number of false solutions that are promoted by greenwashing lobbyists and financiers.

Nigeria, as a major oil producer, wants to prolong the status quo as much as possible.

"Last year, the Vice President wrote an article denouncing growing calls for fossil fuel divestment.

"Nigeria's climate policy heavily relies on so-called 'carbon sinks'--meaning the country plans to keep burning fossil fuels, but supposedly remove the emissions after they have been produced (presumably through Carbon Capture and Storage and other unrealistic solutions, like planting trees).

"The risk of carbon capture and storage is that it provides a pretext to continue burning fossil fuels instead of switching to clean energy."

They also pointed that the science is clear on the need to rapidly transit from fossil fuels if there is the will to achieve a safe climate for all.

"Obviously, the fossil fuel industry doesn't want to do that--so they tell us to give them money for carbon capture instead. Carbon capture is a totally unproven solution", the group said.

However, as part of their recommendations, was the absolute stoppage of the World Bank from funding fossil fuels projects: "A Future Fit World Bank must genuinely help to reduce carbon emissions by shifting financing from fossil fuels to renewables and help ensure that new infrastructure benefits local communities and prepares workforces to operate a clean economy.

"To achieve this the Bank must: Stop using public money to bankroll dirty polluters. Sign the Glasgow Clean Energy statement before the next COP and leave fossil fuels in the ground. Close loopholes allowing private lenders and asset managers to continue extracting and exploiting fossil fuels.

"Align all policies, programmes and projects into a 1.5-degree roadmap with poverty alleviation at its heart. Prioritise investment in Global South renewable energy projects, with civil society input, toward publicly owned, democratically controlled systems that serve the common good instead of private profit.

"Stop hoarding reserves and mobilise $1 trillion in new, genuinely green finance.

Move away from an extractive model of financing towards delivering a just transition, through investments which benefit people on the poverty line instead of the 1%. Evaluate impact through the lens of sustainability, equity and justice. Actively champion an independent body to restructure sovereign debt.

"Raise ambitions so that half of all World Bank financing is on climate adaptation and mitigation, given the scale and urgency of the crisis. Candidates for World Bank Leadership should be accountable and committed to scientific evidence."

HD 	'Solutions Lie in Solidarity' UN Chief Says On South-South Cooperation Day

In this era of unprecedented challenge and upheaval, "solutions lie in solidarity," the UN chief said in his message commemorating United Nations Day for South-South Cooperation, on Monday.

South-South cooperation is unity among people and countries of the developing world, known as the global South, which contributes to national well-being, collective self-reliance and achieving the global goals.

TD 
	

"South-South and triangular cooperation are critical for developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate disruption, address the global health crisis, including COVID-19 recovery, and achieve all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)," underscored Secretary-General António Guterres.

Share solutions

Given the post-pandemic scenario, the political-economic crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and climate change, developing countries - with the support of partners in the North, international financial institutions, the private sector, think tanks and others - must strengthen South-South and triangular cooperation.

The UN chief stressed the importance of Southern-led development solutions being shared "far and wide".

"South-South and triangular cooperation must play an ever-increasing role in resolving our common challenges".

Bridging inequalities

But that does not absolve wealthier States of their responsibilities to work constructively with the developing world, "especially to reduce growing inequalities between and within nations," Mr. Guterres flagged.

In commemorating the day, he encouraged "all nations and communities to redouble cooperation and build bridges to achieve an equitable and sustainable future for all".

"South-South and triangular cooperation must have a central place in our preparations for a strong recovery," said the Secretary-General.

"We will need the full contributions and cooperation of the global South to build more resilient economies and societies and implement the Sustainable Development Goals".

Rich history of cooperation

The UN history of South-South cooperation dates back to 1949 with the establishment of the first technical aid programme by the Economic and Social Council and the creation of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in 1965.

Subsequently, in 1978, the conference of the Global South in Buenos Aires, resulted in one of the main pillars for South-South cooperation: the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries.

Later, in 2009, at the High-Level UN Conference on South-South Cooperation in Kenya, the Nairobi outcome document highlighted the roles that national Governments, regional entities and UN agencies have to play in supporting and implementing South-South and triangular cooperation.

Finally, in 2013 the UN Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC) as we know it today came into being.

After the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, the General Assembly decided one year later to convene a second high-level UN Conference on South-South Cooperation, on the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action.

The 2022 high-level commemoration of the UN Day for South-South Cooperation in Bangkok, Thailand, celebrates and reflects on the advocacy and commitment of contributing to urgent development solutions.

With the outbreak of Monkeypox in non-endemic countries leading to a scramble for vaccines, global health advocates are again calling for equity to be prioritized in the international response.

Equity was a top concern during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency health response. The World Health Organization (WHO) helped spearhead several initiatives in an attempt to reduce disparities between nations, notably COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator.

Yet, despite these efforts, figures from Our World in Data show that only one in seven people are fully vaccinated in low-income countries. In contrast, almost three in four people have been fully vaccinated for a year in high-income countries.

Fatima Hassan, human rights lawyer and founder of South African-based civil society group Health Justice Initiative, sees the current disparity in Monkeypox vaccine access as the latest example of the Global South, and Africa especially, being disadvantaged in the global health space.

"We still as Africa don't have any supplies of monkeypox vaccines, even though as a continent, we've been dealing with this disease for a number of years. So on one level, now that it's become a Global North problem, the vaccines have been found for them, but not for us."

Monkeypox can be combated with smallpox vaccines, which are 85 percent effective against the virus. Since the disease was eradicated in 1980, the WHO has had 31 million doses set aside for a rapid response in case smallpox should re-emerge. The organization is currently assessing the potency of this stockpile and whether it can be deployed against Monkeypox.

However, these doses have never been distributed in Africa, where Monkeypox has circulated since the 1970s. The continent is also facing a much higher death rate. When the WHO declared a global health emergency, the only deaths recorded were from West and Central Africa, where 4.7 percent of people who contracted the disease had died.

In the case of COVID-19, many saw the international rules that allow pharmaceutical companies to protect their intellectual property (IP) as simply reinforcing existing disparities between countries.

Several wealthy countries signed contracts with pharmaceutical companies, helping finance private sector research and development, in exchange for prioritized access to vaccine supply. When companies eventually developed successful vaccines, the technology they used was restricted from being shared with the global community. Nations that lacked both the technology and the resources to purchase on the open market resources had to rely on vaccine donations from rich countries that came several months later.

Over 100 organizations and networks joined a coalition called The People's Vaccine to call for the suspension of intellectual property rules and mandatory pooling of COVID-19-related data and technologies. Those supporting the alliance's call include the current leaders of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, and former Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.

For Hassan, intellectual property regulations were especially problematic given the participation of Africans in trial phases for Moderna and Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccines.

"We did all those trials; we've contributed to the knowledge generation and to the scientific knowledge that allowed [pharmaceutical companies] to get emergency use authorization. But we were not guaranteed supplies or access or preferential access. So the deeper inequity in this entire setup was also that the Global South was asked to participate in the research and the trials, but there was no regulated way of ensuring [... ] genuine benefit sharing agreements."

For countries worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of increased self-sufficiency in coping with global health emergencies.

"I think that was the lesson of COVID. For the global South, it was like, oh, okay, we need to actually figure this out by ourselves," Hassan said.

Several initiatives have been created to fulfill this goal, including a new mRNA vaccine technology hub in South Africa.

The hub was launched by the WHO and COVAX in Afrigen, Cape Town, on June 21, 2022. It aims to bolster low and middle-income countries' capacity to produce COVID mRNA vaccines by training scientists in developing mRNA vaccines and pooling all knowledge acquired by partners. The site in Afrigen will be run by a consortium that includes Biovac, Afrigen Biologics, and Vaccines, a network of universities, and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

When the hub launched, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa commended the initiative and its implications for Africa's role globally.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the full extent of the vaccine gap between developed and developing economies and how that gap can severely undermine global health security. This landmark initiative is a major advance in the international effort to build vaccine development and manufacturing capacity that will put Africa on a path to self-determination."

African scientists are heading the technology transfer hub. It has already produced the first batches of an mRNA vaccine with technology that will be transferred to 15 countries.

Reflecting on Africa's response to COVID-19, Public Health Professor Flavia Senkubuge told IPS that she's proud of how well the continent dealt with the caseload, especially as many predicted COVID-19 would "literally obliterate" the region.

The WHO has cited Africa as "one of the least affected regions of the world" throughout the pandemic. The number of total deaths from the continent, 256 555, makes up 3 percent of the world's total, 6.49 million. In contrast, deaths from the Americas and Europe accounted for 46 and 29 percent, respectively.

Senkubuge told IPS that predictions that Africa would be completely overwhelmed overlooked the expertise Africa has garnered in combating public health crises, notably HIV and AIDS.

"If you look at South Africa, for people like me who trained and practiced as physicians during the HIV and AIDS period, we are used to those large numbers of very sick patients. Additionally, in South Africa, you must remember that we are a country that has a quadruple burden of disease, therefore which means we have a high volume of patients coming into our health establishments. We are therefore used to working differently, having an optimum triage system, and working in under-resourced and high-pressure environments."

Being underestimated also extends to the work of African scientists. Both Hassan and Senkubuge told IPS that the work of Africans is often neglected and overlooked in global settings.

Yet, the pandemic has also highlighted their contributions to global health, Senkubuge said. She pointed to South Africa's discovery and swift response to the emergence of the Omicron variant. She believes this has led to a shift in how African scientists are considering their work on the global stage.

"As African [scientists], [... ] I think we have kind of shifted the paradigm to say we are here, we are not going anywhere. We're not going to try and convince anyone regarding the excellence of our work, we'll just do our work, continue to share it with our communities, publish in the top journals and be part of the global discourse on our own terms. You're welcome to retake, amend, recheck, but actually, we stand resolute in our unapologetic knowledge that the work we do here in Africa is excellent and contributes significantly to global health."

"We can no longer count on gas coming from the Russian Federation and we want to build a new partnership with countries like Nigeria with whom we have an already well established partnership to obtain more gas and LNG from you on good commercial terms," Mr Baldwin told PREMIUM TIMES.

An official of the European Union in an exclusive interview with PREMIUM TIMES said the EU is willing to help Nigeria increase the competitiveness of its liquified natural gas (LNG).

TD 
	

Matthew Baldwin, EU deputy director on energy, told PREMIUM TIMES that the EU is willing to partner with Nigeria to make its gas cleaner thereby improving its competitiveness in years to come.

Mr Baldwin who visited Nigeria on a fact finding mission said the EU is seeking to move away from Russian gas following the aggression on Ukraine (by Russia) and gas cuts. Russia's state-owned gas company Gazprom on 25 July said it would cut flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany in half, to just 20 per cent of its capacity.

"We can no longer count on gas coming from the Russian Federation and we want to build a new partnership with countries like Nigeria with whom we have an already well established partnership to obtain more gas and LNG from you on good commercial terms," Mr Baldwin told PREMIUM TIMES.

Excerpts:

PT: Europe for a while now has talked about energy transition; phasing out unclean energy, moving away from gas and fossil fuel but you are here to see how to get more gas into Europe from Nigeria. Is that not contradictory for the mission?

Mr Baldwin: Not at all but I quite understand your question. I think it is very much the right question to ask because, we are very supportive of what Nigeria is doing with regards to its energy transition plan, the major commitment that you have taken to deliver and be climate neutral by 2060. We are looking to be the first climate neutral continent by 2050 and then you are not far behind.

We are committed to supporting you in those efforts. I think for both of us, gas is going to be an important transition fuel, which is one of your major exports and commodities and we want to be major customers of Nigerian gas.

And here is the explanation to the dichotomy: we need more gas from Nigeria as a result of the terrible war of aggression Russia has mounted on Ukraine. We can no longer count on gas coming from the Russian Federation and we want to build a new partnership with countries like Nigeria with whom we have an already well established partnership to obtain more gas and LNG from you on good commercial terms. So that is the reason, there is no dichotomy and we are determined to support your efforts to move into renewables, to use energy more efficiently, to reduce your use of energy, we are doing that ourselves, we have a major gas reduction plan but again, we will need more gas coming from Nigeria to replace the gas (Russian gas) we are taking out of the system.

PT: Is Nigeria the only partner or option you are looking to get gas from in Africa? Africa appears to be the beautiful bride everyone wants to court, so what other parts of Africa are looking towards?

Mr Baldwin: This is my first visit in my new function as running the energy platform taskforce and I am very proud that Nigeria is the first country I have visited but obviously we have a signed memorandum of understanding with Egypt and Israel and president of the European Commission was in Azerbaijan on Monday (July 18) with my commissioner to sign an MoU with Azerbaijan and other partners and of course she mentioned Africa.

There are some very interesting potential sources for us to look at but I think Nigeria should enter these discussions with a spirit of confidence, we are already getting 14 per cent of our LNG from Nigeria and we would like to increase that amount and that is why the security of the gas supply in Nigeria is so important ... why the commitments we have had this week from the NNPC, from the minister, from the military is so important in terms of safeguarding the asset that you have.

PT: So do you have a target that you are looking to move up to?

Mr Baldwin: I do not want to put a number on that and partly because I am not the negotiator for the gas contracts that is for the companies to look at ... but companies are interested in bringing more LNG from Nigeria and if you look at the total potential LNG reserves in Nigeria, it could go all the way from 14 per cent to something in the 30s. So this is a huge potential that we see here in Nigeria as a partner.

PT: Nigeria already has an energy transition plan but if we must make a good transition, we will need technologies to do this. Is this part of the conversation?

Mr Baldwin: This is the point we have heard very eloquently expressed by the Minister of State for Petroleum. He said he wants to look at technologies; I think there are a lot of things we can talk about, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage. How do we capture the global methane partnership which Nigeria signed up to at the last COP meeting in Glasgow. Let us look at the different technologies we need to green the gas supply even further to make gas even cleaner fuel and thereby improving your competitiveness in selling your LNG in years to come.

PT: There is a feel of hypocrisy and opportunism from the Global North; people say that you would not have come to Africa if Russia did not attack Ukraine. Is this a fair assessment of the issues from an EU perspective?

Mr Baldwin: I would politely reject the accusation of hypocrisy or opportunism on our part. I think we are ready to acknowledge that in the past, we have allowed ourselves to be too dependent on gas from one supplier and we have been trying to adjust that dependency over the last few years since the incidents in 2006, 2009 and as I said we have been steadily increasing our purchase of LNG from Nigeria over the last few years to get 14 per cent.

I think the war changes everything, makes it clear that we cannot count on Russian gas and the president of the EU Commission has made it very clear that we want to get out of Russian gas completely and I am coming here in an open, free, frank and friendly way to discuss with our friends here in Nigeria whether we can do something of mutual benefit and again, it is not just about coming here to grab LNG and run.We want to develop a long lasting energy partnership, I think we have established that in terms of helping you with the energy transition plan and may be I am too optimistic but I think what we have is a good working platform to take things forward together.

PT: For clarity, what are the supports the EU is offering to Nigeria per its energy transition plan?

Mr Baldwin: You have rightly asked for support, I think you set a target of $10 billion a year in terms of support. When I look at the numbers that have already been pledged or that are in programmes, it is up to $6 billion if you take into account the support of big donor partners such as the World Bank and from outside, we have already pledged in the future a total of $400 million and these are in exciting things like how we can improve the quality of your grid, helping where you need to go off-grid, in terms of decentralising your energy use. There are a lot of exciting things we can do together and that is why I get revved up about this new agenda and partnership we can deliver.

PT: We saw how the energy conversation shifted at the G7 summit; how do you think this will impact climate change commitments?

Mr Baldwin: I do not know. I was at the COP26 in Glasgow and it was a vibrant discussion in so many different areas including of course in climate financing, what Mccann talked about there with the climate fund, I think it is ?3 trillion of potential funding out there. There is huge interest in the financial community in funding genuinely carbon neutral projects and I think Nigeria, if it positions itself well, is going to be in a good position to take that forward. I know that there are commitments you would like the G7 to take in supporting your energy transition, I cannot speak for the G7 but I think your message is being heard loud and clear about what your ambitions are and I think let us take the partnership on things like methane and things like technologies forward into the COP27 and take it on beyond that as well.

PT: The $100 billion climate finance commitment; where are we with it? Is the Global North reneging on its pledge?

Mr Baldwin: Not at all. I know that the global south would like to see quicker and frank commitments, I think we in the EU have delivered on all our commitments and we are keen to push forward on that and to be leaders on that. We are proud of our engagement with the global south.

It is not an area of direct responsibility for me so I do not know the precise figures but I think I can say, we very much understand the wishes of the global south to take this forward and we are very keen to be your partners in helping access these big flows much coming from the private sector I think in the future to transform your position, to take forward your energy transition plans and develop a real partnership for us in the future.

PT: Apparently, the war in Ukraine is draining all the resources that would otherwise go to climate change financing in other parts of the world. From an EU perspective, is this a fair assessment of the issues?

Mr Baldwin: You are right to say that Ukraine is a European country and we need to be really conscious of this disaster that has befallen a neighbouring country in our backyard, an unjustified war of aggression and we make no apologies for that.

Yes, it has been a clear focus of our attention and it will be until that war of aggression ends and we can set things straight but I think we are wrong to underestimate the impact of this war on Africa and the rest of the developing world. The blockage in the ports of Ukrainian grain, Europe will be hungry, Africa risks starving if we do not get that grain out and I heard overnight of a deal which will enable that grain to come out and that is not a moment too soon.

But more generally, I think we are capable in the EU with other international partners ... once we know we have got this for long term battle in terms of climate change and we know that is only going to happen if we have a partnership with the global south, countries like Nigeria which has been bold enough and brave enough to step up to the plate and say it is ready to take on the commitments, we welcome that.

You are the most populous country in Africa, you are at the same time the richest and poorest country in Africa in terms of your population and so that makes you the perfect partner to take forward some of these issues and make sure that we address climate change in a fair way.

PT: You keep saying Nigeria needs to take leadership, what for you will make for exemplary leadership in the climate change conversation?

Mr Baldwin: I would not tell Nigeria what it should be doing. Nigeria is a mature and impressive partner and leader. So when you put your finger on it, this thing is already affecting Nigeria and Africa, it risks starvation and lack of access to water as well as terrible extremes of climate in the future and we want you to continue to do what you are doing, to work with us as partners. One of the ministers said, we are brothers in this because we are one world and that is so right, let us take that seriously, let us take that forward together and be a good example for the rest of Africa.

HD 	UK Work Visa for Elite Graduates Is Exclusive and Based On Flawed Assumptions

AU

LP 
	

The UK government's announcement of a new work visa option aimed at attracting top graduates has elicited some backlash because the list of eligible institutions features no universities from Africa, Latin America or South Asia. The Conversation Africa's Nontobeko Mtshali asked Orla Quinlan, Director of Internationalisation at Rhodes University in South Africa, to share her thoughts on the implications such visa programmes have for international integration and intercultural efforts in higher education.

What has the UK government announced?

TD 
	

The UK government recently introduced a new "High Potential Individual" short-term work visa. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the intention was put "ability and talent first" - not where people come from.

The conditions of the high potential individual visa allow a stay of two or three years in the UK for graduates holding a master's degree or a PhD, respectively. This visa can't be extended, but holders may apply for longer-term visas.

Applicants need to have financial resources to acquire the visa and to sustain themselves while searching for employment. The high potential individual visa doesn't pertain to international students who are already registered at universities in the UK.

But the visa is restricted to graduates from specific universities featuring in the top 50 places of two international university rankings.

Who is eligible?

The most recent list of eligible universities comprised more than two dozen US universities. Other institutions are in Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore and Sweden.

Each of these universities appeared in at least two of the following ranking systems: the Times Higher Education world university rankings, the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the Quacquarelli Symonds world university rankings.

African universities don't appear in the top 50 of any of these ranking systems. The criteria they use consider aspects like the university's research output, high achieving academics and alumni, reputation among employers, and international student ratio.

The performance of individual students isn't a criterion in any of these rankings.

Ranking systems are commercial entities. While deeply flawed, they play an increasing role in shaping opinions about the quality of tertiary education institutions. But many universities that don't feature in rankings graduate students who excel in their individual performances. The ranking systems are already heavily contested. To only correlate high performing individuals with specific universities is unscientific. Rankings have little to do with individual performance.

If any ranking system has to be used, it's been suggested that the Impact Rankings produced by Times Higher Education might be more appropriate. This measures universities' impacts on the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. At least, this ranking is more inclusive of global South universities.

What does this tell us about inequality in higher education?

Attending the highly ranked eligible institutions requires the means to pay for fees, accommodation and living costs. For example, almost all the US institutions on the list are private colleges that charge high fees. Many high-performing students from the global South can't afford to attend. Many brilliant students will, therefore, never be eligible to access the high potential individual visa.

Universities from Latin America, Africa and most of Asia aren't on the list of eligible universities. It's not even possible for many universities to meet the specific criteria chosen. This exclusion sends a negative message.

The high potential individual visa shows short-sightedness about the experience, insights and skills that graduates from the global South could bring to the UK. Many individuals demonstrate high achievement outcomes, in spite of operating in under-resourced universities. This is due to their resilience and grit - the strongest predictor of success, according to the studies of American scholar Angel Lee Duckworth.

Should something change?

Countries are entitled to make their own decisions. But some countries are making short-term populist decisions, rather than longer term strategic decisions for the benefit of their own citizens and the world.

The world needs to build relationships for future global collaboration. We need to create, share and disseminate knowledge - a key lesson of the COVID pandemic. Mobility of higher education students needs to continue. These mobile students need prospects in the countries where they study, as one option, to circulate the global pool of talent.

The claim from Priti Patel that this visa "puts ability and talent first - not where someone comes from" doesn't stand up to scrutiny. The UK is offering an elite visa for well-off graduates from elite institutions to come and stay temporarily in the UK for two to three years.

The call from Rishi Sunak, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, for students to "take advantage of this incredible opportunity to forge their careers here" is hardly realistic. A visa of this duration is simply not long enough to genuinely forge a career beyond an initial experience.

Any person who has just arrived in a new country still has to acclimatise to the culture, find a job and develop relationships before they can start to contribute.

What are the implications for higher education?

The high potential individual visa isn't particularly going to affect the mobility of students to, and from Africa's higher education sectors because it's a work - not a study - visa. But it's a troubling manifestation of a changing value system which is increasingly exclusionary, elitist and undermining of diversity.

Higher education in Africa is acutely aware of its local challenges. These include the impact of structural social and economic inequality, environmental degradation and climate change in African countries. We know that we cannot have global peace and security if we don't improve education and job opportunities for all. That is why African universities are concerned with higher education being relevant and solving real problems by connecting our research, teaching and learning and community engagement and sharing our knowledge with the world.

HD 	How Structural Racism Shows Up In Peacebuilding Processes

Peace Direct's new report titled Peace, Race and Power explores how racism manifests itself within peacebuilding sectors. Compiled through global consultations which included over 160 people from 70 countries, the 55-paged report builds upon the findings of the May 2021 report titled Time to Decolonise Aid which found systemic racism across the wider humanitarian, development and peacebuilding sectors. The report was in collaboration with the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict (GPPAC), International Civil Society Action Network (ICAN), and United Network of Young Peacebuilders (UNOY).

Decolonising Peacebuilding Processes

TD 
	

The Oxford definition of decolonization is "the process of a colony or colonies becoming independent", but the meaning of the word can differ depending on a person's geographic location. In South Africa, the decolonisation movements have tied the word to economic issues including access to quality education, higher education, land and healthcare among others. These movements also aims to dismantle what are regarded as western and colonial systems and structures of knowledge production and dissemination. To be able to unpack decolonisation, the psychological effects caused by colonization have to be acknowledged and addressed.

Nicoline Nwenushi Wazeh, a Gender and Development Specialist and Peacebuilder from Cameroon makes an example of the current crisis faced by Cameroon as the real consequence of colonialism.

"In Cameroon we are facing a situation that has been going on since 2014 where anglophone Cameroonians who are a minority find it difficult to coexist with the French speakers who are a majority. Before colonization we had just one Cameroon and this situation was brought to us by colonial masters, the English and the French and today we find it difficult to come back to the one Cameroon that we used to be and lots of lives have been lost because of this," she says.

Wazeh says peacebuilding processes should be decolonised because communities on the ground are more than capable of speaking on their own issues and have the urgency and know what they want and can speak for themselves, they just want partners to give them room and an opportunity to build capacity to be independent.

"As much as the United Nations Sustainable Goal 17 talks of partnerships for development, I believe in this partnership which is indispensable in a world that has been globalized, but it cannot be one size fits all. We can't use a broad-based solution to resolve problems. Some problems are specific and  need a specific approach," she says.

Raaval Bains, Research Officer at PeaceDirect and a co-author of the report says colonialism was created by greed and a lust for power. As a peacebuilder based in the United Kingdom which is part of the Global North, Bains says there is a problem of ego and arrogance in the Global North towards the Global South.

"It is our belief that what we think and how we think is the correct way, what we do is the correct way of doing. How we are is the right way of being. Colonialism was created by greed and a lust for power. Ego is one of the most deep-rooted issues that we have in the Global North and one of the biggest obstacles for the development of partnerships," he says.

Shannon Paige, Policy Associate at PeaceDirect and a lead author of the report says for meaningful partnerships to exist, there needs to be equality.

"Over the cause of the various days that we held the consultations that was a real key element  that came out again and again which was the lack of recognition of urgency, of resources, of capacity and ability and that covered everything from the belief that local communities were not well equipped to solve their own peace issues, to the idea that they required external actors to help serve as a neutral figure," she says.

How Structural Racism Shows Up in Peacebuilding

Several factors that slows down peacebuilding processes and show up as racist are named in the report, these include peace interventions by way of assumption that Global North actors can 'fix' the problem in other countries and should therefore always intervene directly. Also, attitudes specifically Global North attitudes and assumptions about the superiority of their knowledge and expertise on conflict issues and peacebuilding and the lack of capacity in the Global South. The report also mentions funding mechanisms that are not transparent and inaccessible to most Global South actors as a barrier and that they are often designed with Global North INGOs in mind. Participation is another factor stated as Global South actors are often viewed as victims, perpetrators or would-be perpetrators of violent conflict resulting to the Global South agencies and capacity for peacebuilding often being overlooked.

Recommendations

The report found that the peacebuilding sector continues to sideline local peacebuilders who are most affected by and most proximate to conflicts. It then recommends that Global North actors, including International Organizations (UN, World Bank, OECD etc), governments, INGOs and think tanks should acknowledge that structural racism exists and reframe what is considered as expertise¸ players from the Global North should consider that their knowledge may not be the most relevant.  Peace, Race and Power warns that peacebuilding sector cannot continue to exclude local actors from spaces of leadership and decision-making, nor can it continue to ignore the bias inherent in their efforts.

PRESIDENT Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, yesterday, in Kisumu, western Kenya, declared open the 9th Africities Summit, with a call on African leaders to work for the enhancement of the continent's prosperity through better planning, provision of services and elimination of extreme poverty.

"Kenyatta said the Summit, scheduled to run from May 17 to 21, under the theme: 'The Contribution of Africa's Intermediary Cities to the Implementation of Vision 2030 of the United Nations and Agenda 2063 of the African Union', is important because, as the population of African urban centres grow, there is a need to establish proper systems that will help cities remain well planned and livable.

TD 
	

"It's the first time the pan-African gathering is highlighting the first level of the continent's urban framework, which is made up of around 1,500 intermediary cities with populations of between 50,000 and 500,000 inhabitants. This layer of the continent's urban landscape currently accounts for a little over 30 per cent of its urban population.

"President of United Cities and Local Governments, UCLG, Africa, Christine Mba Ndutume, organisers of the event, said the best way for Africa to meet the future challenges of a rapidly urbanizing continent is through sincere devolution of powers to local authorities and empowerment of leaders at this level to tackle development issues at the grassroots level where it matters most."

"Speaking to journalists at the occasion, Nigerian businesswoman and philanthropist, Dr Mrs Seinye O.B. Lulu-Briggs reiterated the importance of devolution. She urged the international organisations, especially those in the west, to work with their global south partners who work with communities to address issues of climate change linked poverty and displacement affecting residents of poorer countries of the world."

"Lulu-Briggs, Chairman of the Fund of the Alliance of NGOs and CSOs for Global South South Cooperation (ANCSSC), an international network of 450 organisations, explained how the organization is working to raise funds to empower civil society organisations in the global south to lead the fight against effects of climate change and other issues that affect the people."

"Dr Lulu-Briggs highlighted UCLG data which shows that of the 2.0 billion additional people that could be added to the world's population between 2019 and 2050, 1.05 billion (52%) would come from sub-Saharan African countries, and as a result Africa's urban population will be about 1.2 billion by 2050."

"It is therefore crucial that we fashion out innovative ways in which our cities and towns which will be home to most of these people would be able to develop the resilience and dynamism needed to attain the goals of Agenda 2030 and AU's agen," she said. "It is my view that, as groups closer to the people and with the required skills and understanding of the issues, members of ANCSSC and allied organisations should be supported - financially and materially - to play their role as vanguards in the fight against poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy that militates against the progress of our peoples."

" "Delegates started arriving in the lakeside city of Kisumu for the Africities Summit over the weekend.

"The host governor, Professor Anyang Nyong'o delivered his welcoming remarks, followed by United Cities and Local Governments, UCLG Africa Secretary General, Mr. Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi and the President of UCLG Africa, Christine Mba Ndutume and the chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki.

"Also speaking virtually during the opening ceremony, Africities Ambassador Lupita Nyong'o, UN deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohamed and US Special President Envoy on Climate John Kerry, all emphasized the need to build more climate-resilient cities.

"Over the course of the week, participants at the Summit are going to discuss the ways to make intermediate cities more sustainable for their residents. They will also discuss the way local actors, whose partnerships with intermediary cities could help in the structural transformation of the African continent.

HD 	The Time to Support the Global South Is Now

While the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine is shaking up the European security order, other parts of the world are being particularly affected by the war's 'side effects'.

The struggle against the economic consequences of the pandemic and the effects of the climate crisis were already posing major challenges for many developing countries. The war in Ukraine is now making the situation even more difficult to manage, and adding new crisis dynamics as well.

TD 
	

As a result of the Russian invasion, for example, the prices of bread, petrol, and fertiliser are rapidly increasing in the countries of the Global South. At the same time, many exporting countries have restricted food exports, so that in many places, food shortages are looming. In view of these developments, the risk of famine is growing, as is the risk of protests that lead to unrest.

In addition, there is concern that donor countries could become less willing and less resourced to support the Global South, due to new commitments related to the war in Ukraine. Yet these are now needed more urgently than ever. We, Europeans, must counter these fears. Support for Ukraine and a strong commitment to the Global South must not be mutually exclusive.

International solidarity and the adherence to a global commitment

Two examples from Africa show why our commitment to the Global South remains important.

First, the Horn of Africa is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years. Up to 20 million people are acutely threatened by hunger. At the same time, due to the war in Europe, the prices for food and fertiliser are spiking.

Until now, over one third of east Africa's grain imports have come from Russia or Ukraine; but since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, deliveries have plummeted. The region's national budgets are massively indebted after two years of pandemic and economic restrictions, and cannot absorb the price increases.

Meanwhile, the UN World Food Programme (WFP), which sources more than half of its grain from Ukraine and Russia, lacks the resources to combat impending famines. The appeals to the international community are becoming more and more desperate.

Secondly, in West Africa it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect the civilian population. The climate crisis has already led to increased risks of conflict in the Sahel region, among other places, because pastureland and water sources are shrinking.

The lack of economic prospects, non-existent public services and a lack of security are giving people greater incentives to join violent groups. The region's military forces often fight against such groups, without regard for the civilian population. Increasingly, Russian weapons and military advisors are also being used.

Locally coordinated support for human security, which is also promoted by German and European development cooperation, and international peacekeeping missions, such as the one in Mali, can make an important contribution to protecting the local civilian population.

The continuation of the MINUSMA mission and Germany's participation in it have been a subject of debate, especially since the withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer. The war in Ukraine now raises the question more strongly as to whether a commitment is still viable when the current threat is so close to home.

However, Germany's withdrawal from the Sahel region would deprive the civilian population of necessary protection and make it more difficult to provide humanitarian aid. That would be a fatal signal to the local population. It would also hardly constitute convincing evidence of Europe's willingness to assume more global responsibility in the future.

These two examples illustrate that we should intensify rather than scale back cooperation with the Global South now. Our international solidarity requires that we adhere to our global commitment to comprehensive human security both within and outside Europe.

As the Global North, we have benefited from colonialism and globalisation for centuries while we live at the expense of the countries of the Global South, who are not only suffering the most from the climate crisis, but have also contributed to it the least. It is part of our global responsibility to continue to support these countries right now - especially when they are being acutely affected by the effects of war in Europe.

Being a reliable European partner

Europe's commitment to this is more broadly based than that of other partners of the Global South. Russia, China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates work almost exclusively with governments - regardless of whether or not they are democratic.

Europe, on the other hand, also cooperates with legislative bodies, the judiciary and civil society. Whether combatting hunger, protecting the civilian population, enforcing human and employee rights in global supply chains, or strengthening democratic scope, civil actors in the Global South count on European support.

This is not to be expected from Russia and China. In most countries in the Global South, a majority of the population wish to realise opportunities that only democracies guarantee. Continuing the common commitment to social and political rights worldwide - without being naive in terms of foreign policy - must therefore be part of the Zeitenwende.

Continuing a strong global engagement is also essential for Europe in geostrategic terms. No other region of the world benefits from the rules-based multilateral order as much as the EU, which has built its prosperity and supply chains on its reliability.

Therefore, the hitherto underestimated deglobalisation that currently poses a threat along exclusive zones of influence constitutes a particular risk, given the special integration of European prosperity into a global division of labour. This is all the more reason for Europe to commit itself to preserving this rules-based order beyond its borders.

To do this, we need partners. However, in order to find them, we will need to make more intensive efforts than in the past. The circle of the EU, the G7, NATO, and the OECD is too small.

We need to make concrete and fair offers to the Global South that will make the EU a more attractive partner than it has been thus far. This is not out of altruism, but a rational approach in mutual interest.

After all, if we want to secure majorities for a rules-based multilateral order in your own interest, we have to be the partner of first choice for the developing countries and for common political projects.

The need for critical assessment

The abstentions of some developing and emerging countries in the vote on the Ukraine resolution in the UN General Assembly in early March is therefore a warning signal. Among the more than 140 countries that voted for the resolution were primarily those in the Global South where Europe is particularly engaged and which tend to be democracies.

However, we should also look to the reasons that led certain countries to abstain, and derive constructive policy approaches from this. For many countries in the Global South, an increasingly multipolar world is also one in which they can reduce dependencies on Europe and the US and diversify partnerships.

For such countries, Russia is increasingly one of these partners - for example as the largest arms exporter to Africa, but also in the area of grain export. A clear positioning vis-à-vis Russia is therefore more difficult in the case of some countries.

Europe should respond to this in a constructive way. Future cooperation should not be based on categories of 'reward' or 'punishment' for voting behaviour. Instead, the opportunities to jointly shape global challenges should be emphasised.

Countries such as India and South Africa abstained from the vote in the General Assembly, among other reasons, because they assume that we have double standards, for example in the case of fighting the pandemic.

However, these two countries are not the only ones that remain decisive partners for rules-based multilateralism. Therefore, we need to be making more competitive offers to the Global South. For this we need a new framework of cooperation and a better understanding of the other parties' interests.

Our cooperation must be more strategically positioned than in the past. This will require greater coherence between the various political areas in Europe. Approaches in foreign, development, climate and economic policy must mesh with each other.

Despite the increased demand for defence funding, the extensive humanitarian and development policy commitment must be maintained. In the end, every euro spent on crisis prevention saves many times the expenditure than dealing with the consequences of the crisis would entail. Every euro spent on protecting democracy creates a foundation for political stability.

A critical assessment of one's own actions is always a prerequisite for a change in policy. In the past we have too often confused short-term security with long-term stability. For example, Europe's cooperation with African autocrats to control migration to Europe and, supposedly, strengthen regional security was a mistake.

This cost us trust among those who - with growing success - protest against these autocrats and may soon assume government responsibilities. Establishing commercial interests that protect the interests of individual European industries but limit the creation of added value in the Global South makes it easier for other actors to make more attractive offers - for example in the establishment of economic infrastructure.

In a world in which many developing countries are being courted by various potential partners, a fairer EU trade policy takes on geopolitical importance. Through it, we can win the partners we need.

Europe's advantage remains its capacity for multi-dimensional cooperation with the Global South. There it experiences a high degree of recognition - our partners from politics, civil society and trade unions from São Paulo to Bamako to Dhaka agree on this point.

An increasingly multipolar world needs more international commitment rather than less. This also amounts to one way in which our political approach to the new era must be measured.

HD 	Why Non-Alignment Is Urgent for the Global South

We have been outside looking in for too long to believe the West will give us a seat at their table. We need financial autonomy and development that can withstand the attacks of the major powers.

South Africa and other countries that have abstained from voting against Russia at the United Nations General Assembly in response to the war in Ukraine face intense international criticism. In South Africa, the domestic criticism has been extraordinarily shrill, and often clearly racialised. It is frequently assumed that abstention means South Africa is in support of the Russian invasion, and this is either owing to corrupt relations between Russian and South African elites or nostalgia for support given to the anti-apartheid struggle by the Soviet Union, or both.

TD 
	

There is seldom any acknowledgment that non-alignment, in this case refusing to be aligned with the United States and its allies or with Russia, can be a principled position, as well as an astute tactical engagement with geopolitical realities. As two founding figures in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), Yugoslavia's then president Josip Broz Tito and India's then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, said in a joint statement signed on 22 December 1954 that "the policy of non-alignment with blocs ... does not represent 'neutrality' or 'neutralism'; neither does it represent passivity as is sometimes alleged. It represents the positive, active and constructive policy that, as its goal, has collective peace as the foundation of collective security."

The Global South houses more than 80% of the world's people, yet its countries are systematically excluded from any decision-making in the international organisations that make decisions in the name of the "international community". For decades, countries of the Global South have been advocating for the UN to be reformed so that it moves away from the zero-sum game of the cold war mentality that continues to drive it. Gabriel Valdés, Chile's then foreign minister, said that in June 1969, Henry Kissinger told him, "Nothing important can come from the South. History has never been produced in the South. The axis of history starts in Moscow, goes to Bonn, crosses over to Washington, and then goes to Tokyo. What happens in the South is of no importance."

Jaja Wachuku, then a Nigerian foreign minister, posed a still urgent question to the UN's 18th Session on 30 September 1963: "Does this organisation want ... the African states to be just vocal members, with no right to express their views on any particular matter in important organs of the United Nations? Are we only going to continue to be veranda boys?" Global South countries are still "veranda boys" watching the adults make the rules and decide on the path that the world must take. They continue to be lectured and chided when they do not do as expected.

It is time for a revitalised NAM. The NAM will only succeed if the leaders of the countries in the Global South put their egos aside, think strategically on the global scale and put their considerable human capital, natural resources and technological ingenuity to better use. The Global South has an ascendant China, the second-biggest economy in the world. It has India, one of the leading countries in medical care and technological innovation. Africa is rich with a growing population and the natural resources that are needed for the mushrooming AI and cleaner energy industries. However, these resources are still extracted for profit to be accumulated in far-off capitals while Africa and much of the Global South remain underdeveloped, with millions still stuck in the desperation of impoverishment.

A renewed NAM has real potential if time is taken to build new institutions and buffers against the economic warfare that the US has been waging against countries such as Cuba and Venezuela, and is now unleashing on Russia. Financial autonomy is critical.

Economic weapons

Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) has a bank, and for the 16 nations of the Southern African Development Community there is the Development Bank of Southern Africa. Yet the reserves of the countries joined to these projects are still kept in the US or European capitals. This is the time for leaders within the Global South to wake up and realise that given the type of economic warfare that is currently being let loose on a country like Russia, weaker countries across the Global South have no meaningful autonomy.

This is the time to rethink how we conduct politics, economics and foreign policy when it is clear that the West can decide to decimate entire countries. The economic weapons being built against Russia will be available to be used against other countries that have the temerity not to toe Washington's line.

Brics has been disappointing in many respects, but it has opened some space for Global South countries - with their many differences in creed, culture, political and economic systems - to find a way of working together. The rejection of intense pressure to bend their collective knee at the UN Security Council is an encouraging example of the Global South rejecting the assumption that they should remain permanent "veranda boys" (and girls).

As the US rapidly escalates its new cold war against Russia and China, and expects other countries to fall in line, there is now an urgent imperative to reject this cold war mentality of wanting to divide the world along old acrimonious lines. The Global South should reject this view and call for the respect of international law by all countries. It makes a mockery of the concepts of human rights and international law when they are only evoked when it is those countries whom the West dislikes or disagrees with who break them.

Only by standing together and speaking with one voice can the countries of the Global South hope to have any influence in international affairs and not continue to be just rubber-stampers of the positions of the West.

The NAM needs to be confident and bold and not seek permission from the West. Its leaders need to understand that they are there to serve their people and protect their interests, and not allow the temptation of being included in the "big boys club" to sway their stance on issues. They need to constantly keep in mind that they have been kept as "veranda boys" for far too long, and unless they truly take their destiny into their hands, they will forever be at the foot of the table, with their people eating only the scraps from the wealth accumulated by the global economy, much of it from the exploitation of the South.

Capital flight from the global South is immense, with widespread adverse effects. A new book proposes measures to curb, even reverse capital flight from Africa. It also offers pragmatic lessons for many developing countries.

On the trail of capital flight from Africa extends pioneering work begun much earlier. The editors - Leonce Ndikumana and James Boyce - estimate Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has lost more than US$2 trillion to capital flight in the last half century!

TD 
	

SSA currently loses US$65 billion annually - more than yearly official development assistance (ODA) inflows. The book's studies carefully investigate natural resource exploitation - of South African minerals, Ivorian cocoa, and Angolan oil and diamonds.

Such forensic country analyses are crucial to more effectively check capital flight. Outflows since the 1980s from the three countries have been massive: US$103 billion from Angola, US$55 billion from Cote d'Ivoire, and US$329 billion from South Africa in 2018 dollars.

Capital flight has been much more than cumulative external debt. Annual outflows were between 3.3% and 5.3% of national income. Nigeria, South Africa and Angola account for the most capital outflows from SSA, with Cote d'Ivoire seventh.

Resource booms

As governments get more revenue from natural resources, the fiscal 'social contract' is eroded. When people pay taxes, they expect state spending to benefit the public. But with more revenue from resources - via state monopolies, royalties and taxes - governments become less accountable to their own citizens.

Gaining and maintaining access to foreign credit has similar effects. Developing country governments then focus on ingratiating themselves with friendly foreign donor governments to get ODA, and on enhancing their credit ratings.

Hence, such regimes have less political need to provide 'public goods', including services, let alone accelerate social progress. Thus, erosion of the fiscal 'social contract' undermines not only public wellbeing, but also state legitimacy.

To secure power, ruling cliques often rely on 'clientelism' - patronage or patron-client relations - typically on regional, ethnic, tribal, religious or sectarian lines. Their regimes inevitably provoke dissent - including oppositional ethno-populism and civil unrest, even armed insurgencies.

Unsurprisingly, such regimes believe their choices are limited. Another option is repression - which typically rises as the status quo is threatened. The resulting sense of insecurity spreads from the public to the elite, worsening capital flight.

Exploiting valuable natural resources not only generates export earnings, but also attracts foreign investments. One result is 'Dutch disease' as the national currency rises in value - reducing other exports and jobs, inevitably hurting development prospects.

Thus, vast private fortunes have been made and illicitly transferred abroad. Ruling elites and their allies rarely only rely on either state or market to become richer. The book shows how both state and market strengthen private and personal power and influence.

Plundering Africa

The book's case studies show how resource extraction has been central to capital flight. In all three countries, the efficacy of fiscal policy tools - especially to foster investments for development - has been undermined.

Outflows have increased with economic liberalization, as unrecorded financial outflows - via the current account - grow with freer trade. Thus, trade-related financial transactions enable corruption and capital flight.

In Côte d'Ivoire - the world's top cocoa producer - rents initially came from supply chains connecting farmers to consumers. Corrupt partnerships - connecting domestic elites to foreign businesses - have been crucial to such arrangements.

Thus, natural resource primary commodity exports have enabled illicit capital flows. Ivorian cocoa exports have been consistently under-reported - with trade statistics of major importers showing massive under-invoicing by exporters.

Post-colonial political settlements have given a few privileged access to resource rents. With capital flight thus enabled, successive Ivorian regimes have been less obliged to spend more on development or public wellbeing.

Due to the cocoa boom, the post-colonial 'Ivorian miracle' ended when prices fell. The bust triggered a political crisis, culminating in civil war. But the crunch also meant the country could no longer service its foreign debt.

In Angola too, natural resources worsened its protracted civil wars. After these ruinous conflicts, oil rents enriched the triumphant nepotistic regime. This enabled the control to gain control of more, even as most Angolans continued to live in destitution.

Angola's massive oil exports mainly benefited the small elite of cronies around the president. They failed to develop the economy or improve most lives. All this has been enabled by 'helpful' professionals who have enriched themselves doing so.

While benefiting its elite and foreign transnationals, Angola's 'oil curse' has blocked balanced and sustainable development of its economy. Despite rapidly depleting its oil reserves, Angola and most Angolans have benefited little.

South Africa - SSA's second largest economy after Nigeria - seems less reliant on natural resources. Post-apartheid economic liberalization has enabled capital flight as private corporate interests - especially the influential minerals-energy complex - quickly took advantage of the new dispensation.

By under-invoicing their exports, mineral interests have been engaged in massive capital flight and tax evasion. Meanwhile, business cronies have enriched themselves in new ways, e.g., in the state's electric power sector. Such abuses were exposed by the Gupta family scandal, leading to then President Jacob Zuma's downfall.

Stemming capital flight

'State capture' by politically influential nationals have undermined government regulatory capacities with help from transnational enablers. Ostensible 'good governance' reforms have enabled capital flight and tax evasion - by undermining 'developmental governance', including prudential regulation.

Institutional environments, mechanisms and enablers facilitate capital flight, tax evasion and wealth accumulation offshore. With often complex, varied and changing facilitation, capital flight has shifted massive wealth abroad for elites.

Transnational financial networks have eased capital outflows - at the expense of productive investments, good jobs and social wellbeing. Capital flight has worsened financing, including budgetary gaps - aggravating related social deprivations.

Wealth creation enhances the economic pie, but distribution depends on who appropriates it. Improved understanding of such varied and ever-changing relations of appropriation is crucial to effectively curb this haemorrhage.

Greater awareness should inspire and inform better measures to check capital flight from the global South. Instead of the Washington Consensus 'good governance' mantra, a developmental governance agenda is needed.

Hence, curbing capital flight is crucial for financing sustainable development. Checking capital flight and related abuses - such as trade mis-invoicing, money laundering, tax evasion and public asset acquisition by elites - requires well-coordinated efforts at both national and international levels.

All researchers, policymakers and regulators will gain from the book's forensic analyses of financial, fiscal and other such abuses. International financial institutions now have little excuse for continuing to enable the capital flight and tax evasion still bleeding the global South.

HD 	Information Disorder - Report Harnesses Global South Responses

Information disorder threatens media freedom and democracies across the globe. In the Global South, multi-level responses are needed to counter its spread, said Professor Herman Wasserman, the editor of the recently released "Meeting the Challenges of Information Disorder in the Global South" report. He is based in the University of Cape Town's (UCT) Centre for Film and Media Studies.

"World Press Freedom Day [3 May] reminds us how important freedom of expression and especially freedom of the media is for democratic debate and public participation in democracies for citizen empowerment. And information disorder threatens those values," Professor Wasserman said.

TD 
	

His report defines information disorder as the "large-scale contamination of the public sphere with rumours, hate speech, dangerous conspiracy theories, harmful misunderstandings and orchestrated conspiracies of deception". Although disinformation predates the social media era, today's digital media landscape and polarised political environments greatly amplify its spread.

Journalism can help counter disinformation, provided that it inspires trust. "Journalism must be supported as a public good while continuing efforts to ensure ethical, trustworthy, quality content," he added.

"We have seen how disinformation exacerbates problems in society, like xenophobia, vaccine hesitancy or anti-vax sentiment."

With 75% of the world's population, Global South states are generally poorer developing countries with younger, more fragile democracies. Here the problems of information disorder are even older than the Global North, Wasserman said in an interview ahead of World Press Freedom Day on 3 May.

"We have seen how disinformation exacerbates problems in society, like xenophobia, vaccine hesitancy or anti-vax sentiment. It has a real-world impact that affects us all, not only researchers and journalists and free speech practitioners - and it's not going to go away. Rather, it's a challenge that researchers, practitioners and members alike all are equally invested in."

Wasserman's report is timely, providing a comprehensive picture of how information disorder is being mitigated by a range of organisations and movements in the Global South. Funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada, it synthesises comparative reports from four regional bodies: Research ICT Africa, InternetLab (Latin America and the Caribbean), LIRNEasia (Asia), and Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism in the Middle East and North Africa.

Multi-level responses needed

The report calls for multi-level responses, particularly to protect press freedom.

"It doesn't help to only try and counter fake news by doing fact checking if you don't also ensure that citizens are able to access free media and for the press to operate freely."

All these elements are interlinked and contribute to a broader set of aims.

"Information disorder is something that affects all of us, not only researchers, journalists and free speech practitioners."

The report has been written not only to bridge the gap between academic researchers (most research has been focused on the Global North) and practitioners but to be accessible to the public too, "because information disorder is something that affects all of us, not only researchers, journalists and free speech practitioners".

"Some of the more visible and egregious threats are those that are linked to governments clamping down on the media and on journalism and freedom of expression generally," said Wasserman. "Ironically, fake news or disinformation has often become a smokescreen for governments to repress criticism, activism and freedom of speech - a ruse to prevent criticism or questioning."

This has been the case in Nigeria, Kenya and India, where disinformation campaigns have threatened to derail elections.

Information deluge

But there are also other, more insidious threats, said Wasserman.

"People are overwhelmed with information. They don't always know which are reputable sources and don't necessarily have the skills to distinguish good information from bad. That is also a threat to the free flow of information."

Organisations such as Africa Check and Real411 have played a valuable role. Here people can report disinformation free from intimidation and harassment. These entities have also worked to build media literacy among news services.

In some cases, media outlets themselves have fallen prey to disinformation, or their journalists have contributed to this. In South Africa, cases such as the Tembisa 10 reported on by Independent Media have eroded their authority and legitimacy.

"When we talk about press freedom, we must also talk about press responsibility: good journalism. Good, responsible journalism is also journalism that is responsive to context," added Wasserman.

"This means journalism that takes its publics seriously, that views them not only as markets and passive audiences, but also as publics that can co-produce and co-contribute to journalism and freedom of speech. It's finding multi-faceted solutions to a multi-faceted problem."

Economic threats, weakened ethics

In the African context, media institutions are also struggling to survive financially.

"The broader media ecology has changed; journalism no longer has an automatic claim to centrality of news discourses. As audiences started moving away from printed publications and legacy media towards the online environment where advertising pools are now dispersed, old business models have collapsed, and new ones have emerged to fund journalism."

Some media rely increasingly on paywalls and subscriptions. In others, institutional donors have stepped into the breach to fund journalism. One such example is the Bhekisisa Centre for Health Journalism in Africa, which has done phenomenal work during the pandemic, said Wasserman.

"All of these new models are trying to make up for the collapse of the older business model."

"In an unequal country such as ours, we cannot only rely on commercial media to support the public interest."

What then of the public service media?

"Our public broadcaster has unfortunately been highly problematic in recent years, the result of political and management factors," said Wasserman. "In an unequal country such as ours, we cannot only rely on commercial media to support the public interest. We do need a strong and healthy public service media. And community media too.

"In this environment, press freedom is something that is not only the responsibility of professional journalists, but also something that everybody can support and contribute to. This inclusive orientation towards society is what we mean by journalism's public interest."

In training journalists, we must be cognisant of this responsibility, Wasserman said.

"When we train journalists, we shouldn't train them as aloof, distanced, professional elites, but people who are plugged into their communities."

"One part is training journalists to have the technical know-how to use new tools to access information and to do fact checking. But journalism now forms part of a much broader media ecology where media production has been democratised. It's been diversified. When we train journalists, we shouldn't train them as aloof, distanced, professional elites, but people who are plugged into their communities, who know what is happening on the ground.

"For good journalism to thrive, and to educate journalists who contribute to public-interest journalism, we need to help them get a good sense of context in terms of their communities and their country - and be connected to society. They should also have a good sense of how this media landscape is rapidly changing."

Research opportunities

The topic of information disorder also presents a rich area for further research and Wasserman hopes to interest more students in this topic.

"We recognise that this [report] is an initial mapping of the field. We want to build on that and expand that in future."

Facets of the report will be further integrated into Wasserman's teaching on the topic of disinformation from undergraduate level.

"When we look at the world around us, we've come out of a pandemic, we live amid really worrying levels of xenophobia in our country, we see Russia waging war on Ukraine, and there are populist politics and polarisations everywhere. This underlines the importance of reliable, trustworthy information, and freedom of expression. Information disorder threatens this.

"But at the same time, World Press Freedom Day reminds us of the responsibility we all have to contribute to this participatory, open and trustworthy public sphere. Hopefully World Press Freedom Day will remind us that while we should celebrate the freedom of journalism as an institution in our country, we should also protect the values of free speech and public participation in our democracy."

HD 	Lessons From the Global South On How to Counter Harmful Information

The large-scale contamination of the public sphere by rumours, hate speech, dangerous conspiracy theories and orchestrated deception campaigns is causing widespread concern around the world. These ills are collectively referred to as "information disorder" .

The disorder results from a range of factors. They include a rapidly changing media ecology and an increasingly fractious, populist and polarised political environment. The surge in misleading and false information about the Covid-19 pandemic has increased these concerns.

TD 
	

Despite being a widespread problem in the Global South, the study of information disorder is dominated by examples, case studies and models from the Global North. This applies to the available knowledge about the range of responses and counter-interventions that have been put in place.

Our new study, aims to fill this gap. It provides, for the first time, a comprehensive overview of the organisations, activists and movements working across the Global South to counter information disorder. The term Global South refers to the regions outside Europe and North America, mostly low-income and often politically or culturally marginalised.

The study was a collaborative effort by research teams from four regions: sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Asia as well as the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

It explored the methods people use to meet the challenge of disinformation. Special attention was given to how the Covid-19 pandemic has made the problem worse.

We found that a range of actors are working to fight the problem of information disorder. These include teams of independent fact checkers, policymakers as well as media educators. Organisations and movements in lower and middle-income countries are also rising to combat the problem of "fake news".

This study provides useful reference points on how civil society organisations in the Global South are countering information disorder. This includes a focus on what's being done to support reliable and trustworthy information.

Information disorder

The information disorder is being generated by the increasing prevalence of misinformation, disinformation and malinformation in public and on social media.

*liiitag Misinformation is false information that is shared, but with no harm intended.

*liiitag Disinformation is false information that is knowingly shared to mislead or cause harm.

*liiitag Malinformation (malicious information) is when information, factual or false, is shared to cause harm. This is often done by publishing information meant to stay private.

Meeting the challenges of information disorder is particularly important in fledgling democracies or where democratic rights are in decline or under pressure. Access to quality information is vital to enabling citizens to participate in democratic processes.

Many democracies in the global South are fragile and need deepening. In addition, access to digital resources is unevenly distributed and independent media are often under pressure. In these environments, information disorder can further undermine democratic governance and civic agency.

Responding to harmful information

The study found various types of responses - similar to those identified elsewhere - to information disorder across regions. These included:

*liiitag monitoring and fact-checking,

*liiitag legislation and regulation,

*liiitag production and distribution responses. These included algorithmic and technical processes to root out disinformation online, and

*liiitag responses aimed at targets of disinformation - literacy campaigns, for example.

The work done by organisations in the region often shows a multilayered response to the problem. By linking different issues together, organisations show the importance of approaching information disorder as a complex problem requiring various responses.

Examples of how different imperatives are linked together by organisations across the region include:

Combining fact-checking with media literacy initiatives. This is done by, for instance, Dubawa and Africa Check in sub-Saharan Africa. This empowers citizens to establish the veracity of information they come across. They can then become more critical and discerning consumers of media.

Linking quality of information with right of access to information and digital technologies, policy interventions on cyber-security, surveillance and data protection. This is done by, among others, the AlSur consortium in Latin America.

The assumption here is that citizens are unable to empower themselves with quality information unless they have better access to digital resources. Similarly, the integrity of the public sphere is compromised if peoples' data isn't protected, or if governments use digital platforms as surveillance tools against citizens.

Linking anti-information disorder work with media freedom and right to protest. An example is Artigo 19 in Latin America. An example of combating hate speech is by Kashif in Palestine. The linking of these issues is based on the understanding that a democratic public sphere is as much about rooting out bad information as it is about allowing good information to flourish.

Linking electoral information disorder and internet rights. This was done by, for instance, Derechos Digitales in Latin America. It uses advocacy campaigns to engage politicians and digital platforms. Linking these issues makes clear that citizens have to be able to take part in online spaces, where political agendas are set and discussed for democratic political processes like elections to succeed.

Several organisations in the region complement fact checking with their own investigative journalism. Examples include Chequeado in Argentina and Verificado in Mexico. Some also conduct workshops on media ethics, such as Falso in Libya. And, journalism training, as Desinfox Africa is doing in Western Africa.

Combining verification skills with journalistic training, and inculcating ethical values recognises that encouraging good, ethical conduct is essential to eliminating false information and harmful from journalism.

What needs to be done

Our research shows why there's a need to take a comprehensive approach to combating information disorder in the Global South. Effective solutions have to extend beyond addressing only digital content, to seeing the problem as a social and political one as well.

However, the global South should not be treated as a monolith. Important differences and variations exist between countries within regions and between different groups within countries. They're also found between different geographical, economic or social contexts. Future research should, therefore, maintain regional diversity even as it aims to connect the dots across the South.

HD 	Ukraine Invasion Shows Urgency of Renewables Shift for Global South

The global gas crunch offers a chance to move to a more self-reliant energy future

Justin Locke, based in Washington, oversees work on the Global South for RMI, an energy systems transformation non-profit. Francis Elisha leads RMI's Africa program from Paris and Addis Ababa.

TD 
	

Just a few days into the Ukraine conflict, Martin Kimani, Kenya's ambassador to the United Nations, spoke to the world of the need to break with a colonial past to build a better future.

On behalf of one of the continent's most populous countries, Kimani reminded Africans of the pitfalls of looking backwards.

"We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires," he said, "in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination."

Even as colonial domination fades, other forms persist, Russia's invasion of Ukraine offers a grim reminder of the perils of domination by energy dependency.

European nations reliant on Russian oil and gas were slow to respond to the rising threat. And now we are witnessing the unthinkable: a ground invasion of a sovereign nation within Europe's borders, its bloody toll documented in real time via social media, sending ripple effects across Europe and the world.

Beyond the devastating impact on human lives, the unprecedented situation has also shaken the energy sector and rattled the global economy. The war has sparked a public reckoning with the security risks posed by fossil fuel dependency and presents a rare opportunity to reconsider alternatives.

The moment should accelerate the energy transition not just in Europe and the Global North, but across the Global South too.

In recent years, the impact of climate change has animated much of the urgency driving the switch to clean energy, particularly for developing countries across the Global South where the effects are felt most acutely.

However, the economic and security risks of fossil fuel dependency have informed decades of thinking on renewables.

Consider that in 1976 - in the shadow of the 1973 oil crisis, the first war-induced global energy supply shock - Amory Lovins, co-founder of RMI, wrote "Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?"

In this landmark analysis published in Foreign Affairs, Lovins advocated a soft energy pathway for global security, centered on efficiency and renewables, rather than a hard path, with ongoing expansion of fossil fuel extraction, trade, and pollution.

Lovins's article argued that a decentralized energy system powered by renewable electricity would not only be a lower-cost, more equitable pathway to meet the world's growing energy needs but would also cut the risk of war and supply shocks by localizing production of energy.

Though penned nearly a half century ago, Lovins's insights into the risks of energy security remain prescient. Decades of gradually growing national and corporate reliance on Russian fossil energy set the stage for Moscow's miscalculation that its armies could roll through Ukraine un-obstructed.

Indeed, in the weeks building up to the invasion, countries including Germany and France took a back seat in condemning rising Russian aggression, in large part due to their dependence on Russian gas and oil. Worldwide, crude oil prices have tested $130 per barrel in recent days, stoking worries of global inflation and economic disruption.

As the world's second largest producer of gas and third largest of oil, Russia is adept at manipulating its energy leverage.

Its president, Vladimir Putin, is only the most recent example of bad actors who have weaponized fossil fuels for political gain. His tactics offer a sobering reminder of the risks of continued dependence on fossil fuels and the need for an immediate transition to low-cost, reliable clean energy solutions.

Many clean energy initiatives are already under way in countries across the Global South.

In Nigeria, mini-grids supplied by renewable sources such as wind and solar are taking shape. RMI has also partnered with the government of the Bahamas and a local electric utility to de-velop fourteen micro-grids that promise to keep the lights on during category 5 hurricanes. These systems pay for themselves through fuel savings in five to six years.

Each nation, particularly in the Global South, has a sovereign right to choose its own path to economic development, and any advocation for clean energy portfolios should be driven by national decision makers.

That said, it is becoming increasingly clear that efforts to develop new infrastructure for gas should be abandoned. Doing so not only speeds a transition to renewable energy, but also buttresses energy security by preventing dependence on a few fossil fuel exporters.

The spectacle of war can easily overwhelm with feelings of fear, spiraling toward powerless-ness. Yet the courage of the Ukrainian people reminds us that, in the face of discouraging odds, action sparks hope.

Our hope is to not only achieve a clean-energy future for all, but to prevent fossil fuels from ever again being used as a weapon of war by a few oil- and gas-rich states.

As highlighted by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, fossil fuels are a "dead end for our planet, for humanity, and yes, for economies."

Prioritizing a transition to locally sourced green energy across the Global South will secure a path to both energy security and a greener, more sustainable future.

HD 	Why What's Good for TotalEnergies Is Bad for the Rest of Us

The oil and gas major's record-breaking profits will do little to comfort the people of the Global South.

Last week, TotalEnergies published its 2021 financial results and 2022 outlook. Its announcement, revealing profits of over $18 billion last year, shows the largest profit in the history of any company in France. In short, Total is killing it. But the question is: at whose expense?

TD 
	

TotalEnergies (after rebranding last year) has a presence in 130 countries globally, including oil and gas extraction activities, refining and chemical sites, and service stations. Of these, 30 of their chapters are in Africa.

90% of the company's investments go to oil and gas expansion with a view to increasing production by 50% by 2030, with a majority of these projects located within the Global South. If you were to pose the question "why?", TotalEnergies would be quick to tell you their motivations are to support the Global South develop and catch up with the developed world. But who are we kidding? Companies, TotalEnergies included, are driven by profits, the planet be damned.

As the world rapidly divests from fossil fuels and as stricter regulations are imposed on these resources, especially in the developed world, it is not surprising that TotalEnergies and other Big Oil companies have identified the Global South as the key frontier for their polluting business under the guise of generating employment and revenue for these struggling economies and nations. Well, nothing could be further from the truth.

In a highly publicised revelation last year, it emerged that Total knew about climate change and its impacts for more than five decades and did nothing to solve the problems. In fact, all they have done is sponsor greenwashing campaigns and actions geared at misleading the public or hiding the impacts of climate change.

This would perhaps explain why many in Uganda and Tanzania do not see Total's involvement and the announcement of the Final Investment Decision (FID) for the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) and associated projects as a blessing, but as the beginning of an economic decline.

There are several reasons for this. To begin with, the structure of the agreement shows that Total has by far the most to gain. It holds a 62% stake in EACOP, eclipsing the 15% of shares owned by each of Uganda and Tanzania. Moreover, the EACOP Bill (now Act) is skewed to benefit the French company and has many gaps and weaknesses regarding environmental protection, community land rights, and climate change concerns.

EACOP is not the only African charm TotalEnergies has set its eyes on. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Total had called dibs on a large portion of the pristine ecosystem that is the Virunga National Park. After years of dissent from climate and environmental activists, Total bowed to pressure and withdrew from the region. Whether this retreat was conditional remains to be seen.

Elsewhere, the company is currently planning to resume operations on a mega Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) project in Mozambique. This project was suspended for almost a year after its operations ignited flames of social tensions in Cabo Delgado, contributing to deadly conflict. When massive natural gas discoveries were made in Mozambique in 2009, the vision of leapfrogging to middle-income status was all too promising. More than a decade later, there is little to delight in. Instead, unfolding massacres, displacement, and untold misery have become the norm in the country's gas-rich north. Vulnerable locals are feeling frustrated, caught up in a manifestation of the paradox of plenty. Their region is being plundered by political and global economic elites as they suffer violence and human rights abuses amid escalating insurgencies and security threats labelled as "terrorism".

Beyond the irredeemable tragedy in Cabo Delgado, the town of Palma was also attacked, bringing chaos to the doorstep of Total's operations and causing people to flee to neighbouring countries. As a result, TotalEnergies declared force majeure on its $20 billion project, absolving itself of its contractual obligations and commitments while maintaining the largest share of benefits as the project concessionaire. Most recently, Total announced its intent to restart the project, barely before a return to normalcy in the region.

The impacts of the fossil fuel industry in Africa goes beyond human rights violations and economic injustice. Their continued polluting activities will exacerbate the vulnerability of communities in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Madagascar that are yet to fully recover from the terrible cyclones that have left a wave of destruction and death. Evidently, the so-called developmental gains promised by such industries are nothing more than the brunt of an already devastating climate catastrophe as they continue to enrich themselves at the expense of African nations.

The people of Africa do not need to be weighed against profit and economic development. The climate crisis is already unfolding in the region. Solar, wind and other green alternative sources of energy that are in abundance have the potential to fuel the continent's prosperity while putting its people, heritage and the environment at the centre of development.

Editor's Note

2021 was a banner year for attention to national and international tax reforms to reduce tax evasion and avoidance, with legislation in the United States spearheaded by the FACT Coalition and a global reform deal proposed by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). But the Pandora Papers also demonstrated the pervasive scale of illicit financial flows that siphon off wealth into an "offshore' world of secrecy.

TD 
	

Despite the advances, it was also clear that the measures taken were at best a first step towards addressing the accumulation of untaxed private wealth at the expense of public resources to meet unprecedented global crises. In the case of the OECD-led deal, leading experts warned that it would increase rather than decrease global inequality. The "two pillar' solution overwhelmingly favors rich countries over poor countries. And according to the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), the OECD "minimum global corporate tax' of 15% is so low that "a reform that was intended to make sure multinationals pay their fair share will end up doing just the opposite.

The scope of the Pandora Papers is worldwide, but is still only the tip of a larger iceberg of hidden wealth. But they clearly show a pattern of a leading role for the United States as a home for hidden wealth and of the vulnerability of developing countries, including those in Africa.

State of Tax Justice 2021

November 16, 2021

https://taxjustice.net/reports/the-state-of-tax-justice-2021/

Countries are losing a total of $483 billion in tax a year to global tax abuse committed by multinational corporations and wealthy individuals - enough to fully vaccinate the global population against Covid-19 more than three times over. The 2021 edition of the State of Tax Justice documents how a small club of rich countries with de facto control over global tax rules is responsible for the majority of tax losses suffered by the rest of the world, with lower income countries hit the hardest by global tax abuse. The findings are further galvanising calls to move rule-making on international tax from the OECD to the UN.

Key findings

* Countries are losing $483 billion in tax a year to global tax abuse - that's enough to fully vaccinate the global population against Covid-19 more than three times over.

* Of the $483 billion lost a year, $312 billion of this tax loss is due to cross-border corporate tax abuse by multinational corporations and $171 billion is due to offshore tax abuse by wealthy individuals.

* Global tax abuse continues to hit lower income countries more severely than higher income countries. While higher income countries lose more tax in absolute number, their tax losses represent a smaller share of their revenues (9.7 per cent). Lower income countries in comparison collectively lose the equivalent of nearly half (48 per cent) of their public health budgets. The taxes that lower income countries lose would be enough to vaccinate 60 per cent of their populations, bridging the gap in vaccination rates between lower income and higher income countries

The United States of Tax Havens

The Pandora Papers reveal how billionaires, oligarchs, and despots the world over exploit America's patchwork of tax havens.

By William Minter | November 3, 2021

Originally published in Africa Is a Country.

There are many ways in which the United States is not one country.

I'm not referring to the electoral reality of red states versus blue states, or to the split between a radicalized Republican Party and those of us who hope that an inclusive democratic vision of the nation might eventually prevail. Nor am I speaking here of racial or ethnic divisions, however defined.

Rather, what I mean is that the United States, where countless corrupt billionaires and dictators have stashed their loot, is not a single tax haven, but many separate tax havens.

Each state and territory has its own laws and regulations about financial transactions used for tax evasion or money laundering. Enforcement often also depends on municipal and other local officials, leaving ample opportunities for cronyism or simply failures to investigate.

The Pandora Papers, released on October 3, show that the United States is second only to the Cayman Islands in facilitating the secrecy of illicit financial flows. But it's not a simple picture. To analyze the role of the United States in global money flows, one must dig into a labyrinth of financial jurisdictions and players. Wall Street and the federal government in Washington are important actors, but they are not the central players who manipulate the entangled threads.

Based on an investigation by a network of 600 journalists around the world, the Pandora Papers revealed some 12 million financial documents-still only a tip of the iceberg. Among the national leaders exposed was Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who met with President Joe Biden at the White House on October 14.

Ironically, President Biden's home state of Delaware has long been renowned for its use as a tax haven, beginning in the late 19th century. Reliably Democratic in national politics, Delaware still ranks at the top among U.S. states providing secrecy for corporations and ultra-high-wealth individuals, both domestic and foreign.

Both red states and blue states are destinations for those who seek to hide their money from tax collectors and public scrutiny. The U.S. federal system is a patchwork of states and territories, municipal and local jurisdictions, each with its own laws and regulations. This complex map provides ample opportunities for shell games of "hide the money.'

While the same is true to some extent of other nations with federal systems, and of the intricate financial network of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories, the United States offers unparalleled opportunities for concealment, lax enforcement, and legal obfuscation.

The Pandora Papers cite the example of South Dakota, an attractive destination for billionaires and others seeking to avoid estate taxes. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which led the Pandora Papers investigation, obtained access to the records of the Sioux Falls office of Trident Trust. Among its clients were the family of Carlos Morales Troncoso, former president of Central Romana, the largest sugar plantation in the Dominican Republic. Owned principally by two Cuban exile billionaires in Florida, the plantation is notorious for its exploitation of Haitian workers.

South Dakota led the way in providing such trusts, as reported in detail even before the current revelations. But other states, including Alaska, Florida, Delaware, Texas, and Nevada, have followed suit.

The Pandora Papers also document the luxury real estate holdings of Jordan's King Abdullah. Like many other politicians and oligarchs around the world, King Abdullah owns real estate in many places outside his country. The ICIJ found records of his purchases in London and Washington, D.C., among other cities, as well as three side-by-side mansions in a luxury enclave in Malibu, near Los Angeles.

Money-laundering cases often feature luxury real estate, found in almost every region of the world. And the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has orders requiring stricter reporting of all-cash sales in 12 metropolitan areas. But fully tracking such transactions for shady deals or tax evasion is far beyond the capacity of FinCEN or the underfunded Internal Revenue Service, much less local or state governments with few incentives to investigate influential people.

Bottom line: those seeking to track down the hidden wealth that dictators, criminals, or jet-setting billionaires have lodged in the United States must not limit their efforts to supporting changes in national legislation in Washington, D.C. They must also turn the spotlight on state and local communities around the country, in both red and blue states.

In February 2017, for example, the Washington Post called attention to the fact that U.S. relations with Gambia and Equatorial Guinea were not just "foreign policy' but also a local story in Potomac, Maryland. The ousted Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh lived at 9908 Bentcross Drive in the D.C. suburb. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a forfeiture complaint in June 2020 to recover $3.5 million of corrupt proceeds. His counterpart Teodoro Obiang Nguema, who has ruled Equatorial Guinea since his successful coup in 1979, still owns the house at nearby 9909 Bentcross Drive.

The message to look beyond the national political arena in Washington applies not only to tax justice advocates within the United States, who are now making significant progress in reform of national legislation. It also applies to global tax justice networks seeking to expand the transnational impact of their combined efforts. And it applies to African governments and international agencies tracking down the spoils of corruption, such as the still untraced portion of billions hidden overseas by Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha and his associates.

The same hidden mechanisms that siphon money upward to the rich are ubiquitous both in the United States and on the African continent. The effects are felt at all levels, from failure to address global crises such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic to gross inequality in housing and other essential needs.

Exposing those mechanisms and building the political will to curb illicit financial flows requires action not only in national capitals and global institutions, but also in all the jurisdictions where wealth is hidden. Nowhere is this more true than for the United States.

In the United States, new African immigrants have taken the lead in battles to defend social justice on many fronts. Prominent figures include Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Nsé Ufot of the New Georgia Project, and Ayo (Opal) Tometi, one of the three co-founders of #BlackLivesMatter.

In Washington, this message from the Panama Papers is beginning to be heard if not yet followed.

On October 17, the headline of a Washington Post editorial read "States must stop letting the ultrawealthy dodge taxes -- and the law.' Despite the limited progress on national legislation, African and other global advocates for tax justice should recognize U.S. political realities and make good use of the many links they already have to states and local communities in the United States.

ICRICT open letter to G20 leaders: "A global tax deal for the rich"

The Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT) is a group of leaders from around the world who believe that, at this moment in history, there is both an urgent need and an unprecedented opportunity to bring about significant reform of the international corporate taxation system. The Commission aims to promote the reform debate through a wider and more inclusive discussion of international tax rules than is possible through any other existing forum; to consider reforms from a perspective of global public interest rather than national advantage; and to seek fair, effective and sustainable tax solutions for development.

The Commission is chaired by José Antonio Ocampo and includes Eva Joly, Rev. Suzanne Matale, Edmund Fitzgerald, Léonce Ndikumana, Irene Ovonji-Odida, Jayati Ghosh, Kim Jacinto Henares, Ricardo Martner, Gabriel Zucman, Magdalena Sepúlveda, Thomas Piketty, Wayne Swan and Joseph Stiglitz.

Excellencies,

Eight years ago, you mandated the OECD to address corporate tax avoidance by multinationals, which cost countries at least $240 billion a year in lost fiscal revenues. After years of negotiations including 140 countries, the agreement announced last Friday shows that it is finally possible to change a system that was built one hundred years ago. The agreement recognises the basic principle of the need for a global minimum tax to put an end to the tax havens business model. With a global minimum tax, it doesn't matter in which countries multinationals record their profits, as these will be taxed at least at the minimum rate.

The agreement also finally recognises the principle that multinationals are unitary businesses, operating across jurisdictions and that their worldwide profits should be taxed in line with their real activities in each country on a formulaic basis, according to the key factors that generate profit (e.g., employment, sales, and assets) and so that multinationals can no longer pick and choose where to record their profits.

However, this reform process has been watered down in such a way that it will overwhelmingly benefit rich countries.

Proposals for a global effective minimum tax of 21% (or even better 25%, as we advocate) have been rejected in the pursuit of the lowest common denominator of 15%, a success for Ireland, a loss for the rest of the world.

A reform that could have delivered more than $200bn in increased fiscal revenues worldwide with a 21% tax rate, will deliver only $100bn with a 15% tax rate. By giving priority to apply the minimum tax to the countries where the headquarters of multinationals are located, the lion's share of the additional revenue is expected to be received by a small number of rich countries. This leaves aside the application of the principle of fairness you agreed, that corporations should be taxed in the jurisdictions where their profits are generated.

There are legitimate concerns that such a low global minimum will turn out to be the global standard, and a reform that was intended to make sure multinationals pay their fair share will end up doing just the opposite. Developing countries, which rely relatively more on corporate tax income as a source of government revenues, and suffer the highest losses from corporate tax abuse as a share of their current tax revenues, would be big losers. So too would small and medium-sized enterprises in developed countries, which will still pay the full local rate.

Particularly problematic is the proposal intended to address taxing rights, but which will apply to only the 100 largest and most profitable global multinationals and reallocate only a small fraction of their profits. The demand for a commitment from countries to withdraw or refrain from introducing measures to ensure that digital multinationals not covered by the current agreement pay taxes is simply unfair.

Concrete proposals put forward by developing and emerging countries, including some G20 members, to ensure all companies pay taxes in the countries where economic activities take place, and to allow source countries to apply the minimum tax on payment of services and capital gains (the so called "Subject to Tax Rule'), which are used by multinationals to shift profits out of their countries and into tax havens, have been ignored. Repeated concerns with respect to new rules for mandatory dispute resolution have also been given short shrift.

The negotiations are happening in the aftermath of COVID 19, at a time when developed countries are recovering faster than developing countries, who lack adequate fiscal space. Exacerbating this divergence by failing to provide sufficient revenues to sustain economic growth in developing countries is economically foolish. To do so during a global pandemic, when the need for revenue to support public health and economic recovery is greater than ever, is also socially inequitable. Coming on the heels of vaccine nationalism and hoarding by the advanced countries, this agreement is hardly one that enhances global solidarity. Moreover, it goes against global commitments grounded in the United Nations Charter, including those related to human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 10 on reducing inequalities within and among countries.

Overall, the current agreement is not grounded on a proper understanding of the economics of corporate profit taxation and reinforces global inequities. From the point of view of developing countries, it can only be seen as an interim solution which they have been forced to live with. In the absence of sustainable solutions, countries should not be restricted from continuing to pursue alternative measures, such as digital services taxes, which are already generating revenue today, or the solution for taxing digital services that has been developed by the United Nations Tax Committee.

The current negotiations must continue during the presidency of Indonesia in 2022 and India in 2023 but in a different format that recognises the failure of the 2019-2021 process to give effective voice to developing countries. This ultimately must provide the platform for a new, more inclusive, round of negotiations to deliver a new global tax deal for the world.

Addressing the complex global challenges that the world is confronted with today, from the adequate provision of public services to the existential climate crisis, requires visionary decisions that put national self-interest aside in the search for the common good. It means siding not with multinationals and tax havens but with citizens both in the Global North and in the Global South. History will judge you harshly if you miss the chance to get this right.

"The current international financial system needs an urgent overhaul as it continues to undermine workers' rights. The recent agreement on the "Two- Pillar Approach' that aims to tackle global corporate tax avoidance and taxing the digital economy falls short of addressing the priorities of the global South, and threatens their sovereignty.'

U.S. Cold War with China: First Stop, Equatorial Guinea

Officials are hyping the threat of a potential Chinese naval base facing the Atlantic to get yet more funding for military operations.

By William Minter, Anita Plummer, Daniel Volman | December 15, 2021

Originally published in Responsible Statecraft.

In the first Cold War, the Truman Doctrine laid out the premises for prioritizing an anti-communist crusade that lasted an entire generation and served as the pretext for U.S. support for apartheid South Africa and countless other anti-democratic regimes around the world.

Last week's Democracy Summit, noted CUNY Presidential Professor Branko Milanovic, is most likely "a prelude to the creation of an unwieldy association of states that will be used by the United States to spearhead its ideological crusade in the escalating geopolitical conflict with China and Russia.'

Milanovic, who earned his Ph.D. in 1987 at the University of Belgrade and later became chief economist in the World Bank's research department, recalled that in the first Cold War, there was at least the option of a non-aligned movement, in which his native country joined with India to offer an alternative to the Manichean geopolitical choice between the Soviet Union and the United States. "The clash between China and the United States is a clash driven by geopolitical considerations... It has nothing to do with democracy,' Milanovic concluded.

That logic was reflected on the eve of the Summit when unnamed "intelligence officials' and "senior administration officials' took the initiative to talk to the Wall Street Journal about the threat of a possible Chinese base in Equatorial Guinea. According to these officials, "[intelligence] reports raise the prospect that Chinese warships would be able to rearm and refit opposite the East Coast of the U.S. -- a threat that is setting off alarm bells at the White House and Pentagon.'

The article further explained that the United States does not oppose current close relations between Equatorial Guinea and China, which trains and arms the Guinean police and helped upgrade the commercial port at Bata on the mainland part of the country. Rather, the U.S. concern "is that the Chinese would develop a naval base in Equatorial Guinea, which would then give them naval presence on the Atlantic,' charged Maj. Gen. Andrew Rohling, commander of the U.S. Army Southern European Task Force-Africa, in a June interview.

Foreign military bases are located across Africa, especially in Djibouti where the United States and China each have a military base, as do six other countries including Japan, Saudi Arabia, and three European countries. Adding a Chinese base in West Africa as well would not be inconsistent with China's broad foreign policy goals of demonstrating a global presence. Private Chinese security firms have received contracts to work in some commercial ports. But there are no signs of new construction at the Bata port. And Chinese global naval strategy is still overwhelmingly focused on the area off the east coast of China.

Chinese military presence in Africa focuses on support for UN peacekeeping and military assistance to African countries, in line with policy established in 2006. An open question is how Xi Jinping and China's military will "fight terrorism' in Africa, one of the goals laid out at the annual China-Africa ministerial forum in Dakar in late November. China's military assistance to Africa, which includes training of both military personnel and police forces and the export of arms, is an important part of its overall Africa policy which tends to emphasize trade, investment and infrastructural development over security issues.

Hyping the threat of a potential Chinese naval base facing the Atlantic is designed, in part, to obtain increased funding from the U.S. Congress for American military operations in Africa. General Stephen Townsend, Commander of the United States Africa Command, in his presentation to the Senate Armed Services Committee in April this year, cited the potential threat of a Chinese naval port in the Atlantic as "my number one global power competition concern.'

However, it also intended to make it clear that Washington will oppose Beijing pursuing military bases overseas as the United States has done.

"Having Chinese military vessels in the Atlantic represents a new phase of strategic competition,' Ioannis Koskinas, a senior fellow at the New America think tank, told the Turkish magazine TRT World. "It may be that China simply says, 'if the U.S. gets to send its carrier battle groups to the Western Pacific, China can send its ships to the Atlantic," he added.

The threat is really to the assumption that only the United States has the right to a worldwide military presence featuring overwhelming preeminence and a giant military budget to support it.

The "Atlantic base' scare is part of a broader Pentagon and bipartisan effort to exaggerate the military threat from China, also illustrated by the claim that China now has the world's largest navy, as measured by the number of ships instead of the more meaningful metric of tonnage. By tonnage, the United States still has by far the world's largest navy, comparable to the combined tonnage of the next thirteen navies and almost five times that of China.

Given that Equatorial Guinea is over 6,000 miles southeast of Miami, and that China has only 2 aircraft carriers in its entire navy compared to 20 for the United States, it is ludicrous to see the potential of a base there as a serious threat to U.S. security. China, for its part, is ringed by at least seven U.S. bases within 3,000 miles of its coast.

Yet, since 2019, according to the WSJ article and other sources, the U.S. policy towards Equatorial Guinea has been driven by this new Cold War agenda. This to the detriment of long-standing policy which has to some extent challenged the anti-democratic regime of Teodoro Obiang Nguema, who has ruled the country since 1979.

In September this year the Justice Department announced that $26.6 million confiscated from President Obiang's son's assets in the United States, including a Malibu mansion, would be used to support UN efforts against COVID-19 in Equatorial Guinea.

What if the U.S. had cited this to support Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin's new anti-corruption program announced at the Summit? The Justice Department could also have announced that it was filing for forfeiture of the mansion owned by President Obiang and his wife in Potomac, Maryland, as it did in 2020 for the mansion next-door, previously owned by ousted Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh.

If the Biden administration were ready to "build back better' in its Africa policy, it could well experiment with a pilot project in Equatorial Guinea, based not primarily on the interests of the U.S. military and U.S. oil companies, but also on objectives such as democracy, curbing corruption, sustained development in the Central African region, and the transition away from fossil fuel. Both China and the United States would be well-placed to contribute to such a common agenda.

To begin with, it could propose, to the United Nations, the African Union, and other governmental and civil society stakeholders in the future of Equatorial Guinea, a consultative gathering at a neutral location, perhaps hosted by the UNDP. The United States would have standing to do this given the interest not only of the Defense Department but also the Department of Justice, the Treasury Department, and other agencies.

Tutu Alicante, executive director of Equatorial Guinea Justice, who was one of the recipients of the Global Magnitsky Awards in November, is also based in the United States and would be in a good position to advise on participation by global civil society in such an event. And civil society activists might raise questions about the potential threat from surveillance technologies supplied to African governments by China or Israel, its leading competitor in this field.

Such a gathering, instead of providing an opportunity for governments to make dubious claims and promises about their commitment to democracy, might instead contribute to building collaboration in support of common agreed agendas as well as space for honest debate about conflicts in values and goals.

HD 	Rich Countries Have Received More Vaccines in Run-Up to Christmas Than African Countries Have All Year

The EU, UK and US have received more doses in the last six weeks than African countries have received all year.

Global rollout at speed of UK's booster programme could vaccinate the world by February.

TD 
	

At current rates vaccine manufacturers will fail to deliver enough doses to fully vaccinate everyone in Africa by next Christmas.

More doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been delivered to the EU, the UK and the US in the six-week run up to Christmas than African countries have received all year, new analysis from the People's Vaccine Alliance reveals today.

As COVID-19 clouds a second Christmas season in uncertainty and fear in many countries, campaigners warn that governments risk trapping the world in an endless cycle of variants, boosters, restrictions and even lockdowns, if low vaccination rates are allowed to persist in the global south.

Low and middle-income countries must be allowed to manufacture vaccines themselves to end vaccine inequality and prevent variants from derailing future Christmases, campaigners warn.

Between 11 November and 21 December 2021, the EU, UK and US have received 513 million doses of vaccines while countries in Africa received just 500 million throughout the whole of 2021.

The UK government, facing a rapid surge in Omicron variant, has a target of administering one million booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines a day in response, equivalent to vaccinating 1.46 percent of the population every day. If every country was able to vaccinate at the same rate as the UK target, it would take just 68 days to deliver a first dose to everyone who needs one, leaving no one unvaccinated by the end of February 2022.

Just 8.6 percent of people in Africa have been fully vaccinated to date and at the current rate of delivery by vaccine manufacturers, it won't be until April 2023 that everyone will receive their first dose. Recent research found that 78 percent of people in Africa are willing to get vaccinated, higher than in many rich countries.

G7 countries will have 1.4 billion surplus doses by March 2022, even after giving all adults a booster but are failing to deliver on donation pledges. The US has delivered just a quarter of the vaccines it promised to donate while the UK and Germany have delivered 15 percent and 14 percent respectively.

Anna Marriott, Health Policy Manager, Oxfam and the People's Vaccine Alliance, said: "Make no mistake rich country governments are to blame for the uncertainty and fear that is once again clouding Christmas. By blocking the real solutions to vaccine access in poorer countries they are prolonging the pandemic and all its suffering for every one of us.

"Rich countries are banking on boosters to keep them safe from Omicron and future variants of COVIDd-19. But boosters can never be more than a temporary and inadequate firewall. Extinguishing the threat of variants and ending this pandemic requires vaccinating the world. And that means sharing vaccine recipes and letting developing countries manufacture jabs for themselves."

Experts have raised concerns that low vaccine coverage in the global south created conditions where a variant like Omicron was likely to emerge. Nine months ago, a survey of leading epidemiologists warned that persistent low vaccine coverage in parts of the world increased the risk of vaccine resistant variants emerging within a year or less.

Nick Dearden, Director of Global Justice Now, said: "If we ever want to have a normal Christmas again, we need to vaccinate the world. But right now, the UK and EU are holding back international efforts to use and expand manufacturing and distribution capacity in low and middle-income countries. It's reckless and risks trapping us in an endless cycle of variants, boosters, restrictions and even lockdowns."

In October 2020, India and South Africa proposed a waiver of intellectual property rules on COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments to allow low and middle-income countries to manufacture these life-saving tools. Despite most countries, including the United States, supporting a waiver, the UK, EU, and Switzerland have prevented progress.

Maaza Seyoum from the African Alliance said: "Leaders in the global north have so far chosen the obscene profits of pharmaceutical companies over the lives of people in Africa. But the Omicron variant shows that vaccine inequality is a threat to everyone, everywhere. Boris Johnson, Olaf Scholz, and European leaders need to finally support an intellectual property waiver and let Africa and the global south unlock its capacity to manufacture and distribute vaccines. Otherwise, humanity will never beat the race against the next variant."

Human Rights Watch and Médecins Sans Frontières identified over 100 manufacturers that could produce mRNA vaccines if intellectual property barriers were removed and pharmaceutical companies transferred the technology and knowhow needed.

Despite already making billions in profit, Pfizer and Moderna continue to refuse to share the new generation of vaccine technology with the WHO's mRNA hub in South Africa. WHO scientists are now attempting to reverse engineer Moderna's US-taxpayer-funded vaccine, a process that could take two years longer than if the company shared its vaccine recipe.

Every major vaccine provider has boycotted the WHO's COVID-19 technology access pool (C-TAP), a technology transfer programme established in May 2020 to share the recipe and knowhow needed to manufacture coronavirus vaccines, tests and treatments.

In a video marking World Aids Day, Prince Harry called on governments to break vaccine monopolies, joining over 170 former world leaders and Nobel Laureates, the Pope and more than 13 million people in their support for the waiver.

HD 	Artificial Intelligence Carries a Huge Upside. But Potential Harms Need to Be Managed

Artificial intelligence and machine learning have the potential to contribute to the resolution of some of the most intractable problems of our time. Examples include climate change and pandemics. But they have the capacity to cause harm too. And they can, if not used properly, perpetuate historical injustices and structural inequalities.

To mitigate against their potential harms, the world needs frameworks for the governance of data that are economically enabling and that preserve rights.

TD 
	

Artificial intelligence and machine learning operate on the basis of massive datasets from which algorithms are programmed to discern patterns. These patterns can be used to infer new insights and also predict behaviour and outcomes. Increasingly, artificial intelligence and machine learning are being used to substitute human decisions with automated decision making on behalf of humans. This is often in areas which can have a significant impact on peoples' lives. Take access to loans or even access into a country.

Yet it all happens in a black box that even the designer the algorithm may not have access to, so deciding what goes into the box is important.

The biggest datasets and algorithmic activity are generated by the global social networks that surveil our every action online. These datasets can be used to anticipate and mould our needs and desires.

Big technology firms, multilateral agencies and development banks have made much of the potential of artificial intelligence to advance economic growth and national development. And they're increasingly being used in social and economic applications as well as public decision-making, planning and resource allocation. These include guiding court judgments, selecting job applicants and assigning scholars to schooling systems.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the enormous value of public data and the potential value of combining public and private data to deal with public health and disaster crises.

Yet, there is growing concern about the uneven distribution of both the opportunities and harms associated with artificial intelligence.

The increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in public decision making is raising critical issues around fairness and human rights.

In particular, how digital data are produced is being red flagged. Datasets have some huge gaps. Certain people are rendered visible, underrepresented, and discriminated against as a result, in the way data are collected. The fact that most of world's population isn't connected to the internet and the global social networks that drive the new, data-driven economy means they simply don't exist.

Globally, artificial intelligence also poses a risk to the progress made toward gender equality. Stories abound of artificial intelligence systems being biased against women and gender minorities.

What's more, artificial intelligence systems may rely on assumptions and data that exclude or misrepresent groups that already face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination. This often results in outcomes that reflect and reinforce gendered, racial, and ableist inequalities and biases.

These systems are not adequately subject to the kind of rigorous accountability and regulation needed to mitigate the risks they pose to society.

So significant is this threat that several international forums have emerged that are committed to the development of "good", "ethical" and "responsible" artificial intelligence.

But most of the initiatives present technical solutions to social and political problems. This means they are being developed outside a human rights frame. They are also largely initiatives of the global North, with limited multistakeholder participation from the global South.

There are rights-based data frameworks which inform artificial intelligence development. These include the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. But they tend to focus primarily on first generation or fundamental rights, such as privacy. Privacy is broadly conceived of as an individualised right. It may not always be the chief value in more communitarian-centred societies.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for data to be regulated in the collective interest or common good. This does not mean that the right to privacy needs to be foregone.

Collective interest also pertains to the governance of data in the context of identifiable groups or communities where the potential consequence of individual identification results in the exposure of collective identity.

The literature and practice of data governance has predominantly been viewed and undertaken from this negative regulatory perspective. In other words, with a focus on compliance with data protection and cybersecurity and penalties for breaches.

This is a necessary condition for just artificial intelligence. But it's not sufficient. There are many areas of data governance that require positive intervention. Examples include enabling access to data, its usability and integrity if it is to deal with issues of inclusion, equality, redress, and social justice.

These are issues that can be understood as second and third generation, social and economic rights.

To address these issues, a new global project is being launched on the side-lines of the Summit for Democracy.

The summit represents an international forum to advance commitments in support of democracy and human rights. Its objective is to assess the progress being made by countries in advancing artificial intelligence that respects human rights and democratic values.

The project is known as the Global Index on Responsible AI. It is being led by the African digital think tank, Research ICT Africa, and an independent Data 4 Development network.

Governments and the international community have started to respond to the global call for responsible artificial intelligence. In 2019, 42 countries signed up to the OECD principles on Trustworthy AI. This commits them to ensuring that AI systems are safe, fair, and trustworthy.

Most recently, UNESCO developed Recommendation on Ethics in AI was adopted by its 41st General Assembly. The recommendation centres on the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, environmental sustainability, and diversity.

The Global Index addresses the need for an inclusive, measurable standard that complements the rapidly evolving understanding of what responsible artificial intelligence means in practice. It also encourages and tracks the implementation of governance principles by relevant actors.

The Global Index will track the implementation of responsible AI principles in over 120 countries. An international network of independent researchers will be established to assess the extent to which the principles are being applied. It will also collect primary and secondary data on key indicators of responsible artificial intelligence.

This will equip governments, civil society, researchers, and other stakeholders with the key evidence they need to uphold responsible use principles in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence systems. The evidence will also be used to:

The public and other interested stakeholders will be given an opportunity to help shape the design and reach of the Index which will be developed consciously through a global South lens.

Its development represents an important opportunity for experts from the African continent, and the Global South, to be at the forefront of shaping the new global agenda on the responsible use and development of artificial intelligence.

HD 	Unesco Chair in Open Education Resources for Glenda Cox

Senior lecturer in the Centre for Innovation in Learning and Teaching (CILT) Dr Glenda Cox is the new holder of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Chair in Open Education and Social Justice at the University of Cape Town (UCT).

Associate Professor Cheryl Hodgkinson-Williams previously held the chair but has since retired from UCT. Dr Cox is the principal investigator in the Digital Open Textbooks for Development (DOT4D) project. She will hold the chair for four years.

TD 
	

UNESCO describes open educational resources (OER) as teaching, learning and research materials in any medium - digital or otherwise - that are in the public domain or have been released under an open licence. This allows no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution with no or limited restrictions.

The UNESCO Chairs Programme is a network of chairs that serves as a think tank and bridge-builder between academia, civil society and local communities, as well as researchers and policymakers. The programme is designed to enhance capacity in higher education by facilitating international inter-university cooperation and networking, knowledge sharing and collaboration.

"The social justice impact and potential of open education on teaching and learning is huge."

The chair will create exposure for UCT to new audiences through the UNESCO education networks. UCT is one of approximately 800 member institutions across 116 countries. The university is leading the way in open education in Africa, said Cox.

"With its focus on reusing and sharing educational materials to reach the most vulnerable students, the social justice impact and potential of open education on teaching and learning is huge," said Cox. This is especially relevant in the under-resourced Global South where there is vast potential to improve access to material, enhance its quality - and reduce the costs of education.

As such, the chair fits squarely within the aims of UCT's Vision 2030 and its massive transformative purpose of unleashing human potential to create a fair and just society.

Social justice is the core of DOT4D's work, Cox said. And although the chair doesn't come with a specific mandate, Cox plans to create one around open education resources such as open textbooks. This is an initiative that has the support of the office of Associate Professor Lis Lange, Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Teaching and Learning.

In October 2021, Associate Professor Lange announced the winner of the 2021 UCT Open Textbook Award. The award, introduced in 2020, recognises outstanding open textbooks written by UCT staff and students, which advance the university's transformation and social justice agenda.

The 2021 honour went to Associate Professor Maria Keet (computer science) for her ground-breaking resource An Introduction to Ontology Engineering, the first textbook globally of its kind . Tailored to the South African student context, it addresses issues related to localisation, multilingualism, disability access and technical innovation.

The international collaborative aspect is equally vital to UCT's work in the area, said Cox.

"Having the UNESCO Chair in Open Education for Social Justice is an extra leap," she said. "It's important recognition when you're building a network."

The DOT4D team has created some "fantastic" resources, available on their website, said Cox.

But creating open-source material comes at a cost. The chair doesn't come with a purse, and Cox is hoping the two new posts created on her team for 2022 - essential to research and development -will be underwritten by UCT or external funders.

"If there has been any upside to COVID-19, it's that many more people have used open education resources - and become aware of them."

The time to scale up their work is ripe, she said. Developments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have magnified the need for open education material.

"If there has been any upside to COVID-19, it's that many more people have used open education resources - and become aware of them," Cox noted. "Suddenly, people woke up. At CILT we ran scores of remote teaching workshops [for academic staff]. There were many questions about copyright and intellectual property; people became aware of creative commons licensing."

This awareness must be escalated. Cox sees this as one of her major challenges in the Global South.

"For example, the Massachusetts Institute for Technology (MIT) in the Unites States reported an increase of 1.75 million hits on their open courseware during lockdown - and that the number is increasing. A large proportion of that is from Africa, which is really interesting, because MIT resources are not always applicable to the Global South."

This presents an opportune time for local open education resource developers.

"We must maintain the momentum by creating local open material in South Africa and in Africa; materials that are relevant to us. It's about cultural representation and political framing and it's part of the social justice argument," said Cox.

"Students have a voice in their own curriculum and in their own texts and that means something to them."

And while the cost aspect has been at the forefront of arguments for open textbooks, the social justice aspect is also enhanced by new collaborations between authors and their students, creating opportunities to transform curricula and develop multilingual materials.

"By getting that cultural representation, students have a voice in their own curriculum and in their own texts; and that means something to them. They can see themselves in that text; it's not a foreign text. So, it's a very powerful option. It's all the aspects we want for social justice."

"There's definitely a break in tradition and a disruption of traditional practices around the open textbook," she added.

As this is new territory for many UCT academics and textbook authors, Cox is keen to share author journeys. Sharing stories, experiences and ideas is part of the developmental process.

Cox has also dispelled the notion that open educational material is inferior.

"Our resources are excellent quality, despite being free."

Asad Rehman of War on Want spoke to the presidency of COP26 with words that resonated far from Glasgow: "The rich have refused to do their fair share, more empty words on climate finance. You have turned your backs on the poorest who face a crisis of Covid, economic and climate apartheid because of the actions of the richest. It is immoral for the rich to talk about the future of their children and grandchildren when the children of the Global South are dying now.' Less than 2 minutes.

And the speech to the assembly by Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate was less than 4 minutes long but both eloquent and direct.

Watch here!

Asad Rehman and Vanessa Nakate may have been among the most eloquent. But even most of the governments represented and almost all the journalists covering the conference were well aware that the only minimally reassuring positive results from COP26 was the decision to meet again next year and that the governments did not actually abandon the aspiration to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade.

Memoir

Spy Thriller

Science Fiction & Much More

Especially for all my readers who know the editors of this new book, Prexy Nesbitt and Zeb Larson, but also for anyone interested in the 20th century history of Black America and particularly the Great Migration from the south, this memoir by Prexy's uncle George is a must-read!

Full-disclosure: I am prejudiced in favor. But even so, I think it is no exaggeration to say that this is a great complement to Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson.

It's 1986, and Marie Mitchell is an intelligence officer with the FBI. She's brilliant, but she's also a young black woman working in an old boys' club. So when she's given the opportunity to join a secret task force aimed at undermining Thomas Sankara, the revolutionary president of Burkina Faso, she says yes, even though she secretly admires the work Sankara is doing for his country. Inspired by true events and informed by solid research, this novel knits together a gripping spy thriller, a heartbreaking family drama, and a passionate romance.

The Ministry for the Future is a masterpiece of the imagination, using fictional eyewitness accounts to tell the story of how climate change will affect us all. Its setting is not a desolate, postapocalyptic world, but a future that is almost upon us.

The New Yorker says the author is not only "one of the greatest science fiction writers [but also] "one of the most importannt political writers in America today." In my opinion the best written, most well informed and thoughtful books on how to save the planet.

*************************************************************

The climate conference ended with a watered down promise to phase down rather than phase out coal-powered energy generation and only the most powerful countries got to finalise the pact.

New Frame, 22 November 2021

By Vijay Prashad and Zoe Alexander, in Globetrotter,

https://www.newframe.com/why-our-climate-isnt-jumping-for-joy-after-cop26/

[Vijay Prashad is an Indian historian, editor and journalist. He is a writing fellow and chief correspondent at Globetrotter. He is the chief editor of LeftWord Books and the director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research. Zoe Alexandra is a journalist with Peoples Dispatch and reports on people's movements in Latin America.]

Two major gains took place at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP) in Glasgow, Scotland, which concluded on 13 November: the first was that there would be another COP in 2022 in Egypt, and the second was that the world leaders expressed their aspiration to keep global temperature below 1.5°C alive. These were, however, the only gains made at the end of COP26 to address the pressing issue of climate change.

After more than two weeks of intense discussions - and many evenings of corporate-funded cocktail parties - the most powerful countries in the world left the convention centre pleased not to have altered the status quo.

The focus of the discussions and negotiations by world leaders during COP26 seemed to be on the change of a word in the Glasgow Climate Pact, the final document that will be adopted by nearly 200 nations. Initially, the countries had begun to agree to the "phase-out' of coal; the final version of the document, however, merely said that the countries would "phase down' coal. During the last hours of the COP26 summit on 13 November, Swiss Environment Minister Simonetta Sommaruga took the microphone and expressed her "profound disappointment' with the change. "The language we had agreed on coal and fossil fuel subsidies has been further watered down as a result of an untransparent process,' she said.

Sommaruga is correct. The process has been "untransparent'. Only a handful of world leaders - from the most powerful countries - had the opportunity to put pen to paper on this pact; the majority of world leaders only saw a draft of the Glasgow Climate Pact and were then provided the final document. Civil society associations were barely allowed to enter the hall, let alone to have the opportunity to sit with the pact and give their input on it. As President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen put it bluntly, "never before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few'. Why this "responsibility' was, however, entrusted to the "hands of so few' goes unremarked in her speech.

Words and meanings

During the COP26, thousands of documents appeared on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website, which included reports, statements and proposals relating to COP26. It would take an army of lawyers to scour through the text of these documents and make sense of them. Most of them are submissions made by a range of governments, corporations and corporate-funded platforms as well as civil society organisations.

It was clear from the first day of COP26 that the focus of achieving "net zero' carbon emissions by 2050 was going to be on coal and not on all fossil fuels. Right through the negotiations, this was the fault line, with the Western countries - which are largely non-coal reliant - putting the emphasis on coal - which is used mainly in the Global South, with India and China in the lead. To make the COP26 about coal allowed fossil fuel use in general (including oil and natural gas) to receive a breather. While pressure mounted to cut subsidies for fossil fuels, the Global North was able to gather consensus that only "inefficient' subsidies would be cut with no timetable provided for these cuts. Sommaruga, who spoke so forcefully against the phrase "phase down' when it came to coal, said nothing regarding the allowance for "efficient' subsidies to underwrite fossil fuel use. It is far easier to blame India and China for their reliance on coal than to agree to phase down all fossil fuels.

Climate finance

On 15 November, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that China "attaches high importance to energy transition'. But he specified that there are some issues that need to be looked at before that. First, no energy transition can take place without awareness that "not everyone has access to electricity and energy supply is not adequate'. Cutting coal tomorrow will condemn billions of people to a life without electricity (about 1 billion people still have no electricity connection, with most of them living in the Global South). Second, Zhao said, "We encourage developed countries to take the lead in stopping using coal while providing ample funding, technological and capacity-building support for developing countries' energy transition.' The developed countries had agreed to fund the Green Climate Fund to the tune of $100 billion per year by 2020, but the actual amounts disbursed have been far smaller. No agreement on finance was reached at the COP26. "We need concrete actions,' said Zhao, "more than slogans.'

Glasgow's COP26 was filled with corporate executives. They swarmed the hotels and the restaurants, holding private meetings with government leaders and with Prince Charles. The International Chamber of Commerce told governments to "wake up', while the United States Business Roundtable said that "the private sector cannot shoulder the burden alone'. The implication here is that the corporations are on the right side of the climate discussion, while the governments are being hesitant. But this is partly the work of the spin doctors. Most corporations that have made "net zero' pledges have done so in a non-binding way and without a timetable. At the conclusion of the conference, it seemed that neither the powerful governments nor their corporations were willing to tie their hands to a real agreement to mitigate the climate crisis.

People's Summit

Just a few blocks down from the grand halls of the official summit, people's movements, Indigenous organisations, trade unions, youth groups, migrant groups, environmental organisations and many more met as part of the People's Summit for Climate Justice from 7 to 10 November. Their message was simple: corporations and their pliant governments would not do the job, so people need to find a way to set the agenda "for system change'. The more than 200 events organised as part of the People's Summit addressed a range of topics, from the role of militarism in emissions to building a global Green New Deal, and even holding a People's Tribunal to put the ineffective UNFCCC on trial.

Emotions at the People's Summit oscillated from excitement over being together in the streets after nearly two years of confinement owing to Covid-19, to dread at the imminent disappearance of the low-lying island states. Participants from Tuvalu and Barbados talked about the impact of the inaction by the Global North as they see their islands disappear, their homes flood and their present vanish. "Why are you asking us to compromise on our lives?' asked Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a climate activist from the Philippines and spokesperson for Fridays for Future.

The People's Tribunal called for the disbanding of the UNFCCC and its reconstitution from the ground up as a Climate Forum that does not allow the polluters to make the decisions. This newly constituted Climate Forum would demand meaningful financing for a green transition as well as an end to the plunder of natural resources and to wars of aggression.

Asad Rehman of War on Want spoke to the presidency of COP26 with words that resonated far from Glasgow: "The rich have refused to do their fair share, more empty words on climate finance. You have turned your backs on the poorest who face a crisis of Covid, economic and climate apartheid because of the actions of the richest. It is immoral for the rich to talk about the future of their children and grandchildren when the children of the Global South are dying now.'

Beyond pledges and promises to specific plans with benchmarks and accountability

A brief summary

The current status is well illustrated by today's news. According to the Washington Post,

"President Biden, speaking at a global climate summit three weeks ago, called the planet's warming a "threat to human existence as we know it,' urging the world's nations to slash the use of fossil fuels and adding, "Action and solidarity, that's what's required.'

But facing soaring energy prices at home, Biden is now pushing to crank up the supply of affordable gas and oil for Americans. He plans a release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve that he has coordinated with China and other major energy consuming nations. He is also pushing the Federal Trade Commission to examine whether gas companies are charging too much and is leading a global effort to press oil-producing countries to ramp up production.

Those moves -- along with a government auction last Wednesday of oil drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico -- are prompting warnings from environmental advocates that Biden's push to lower energy prices is undercutting his lofty goals on climate, which he sees as a centerpiece of his legacy.'

For additional relevant articles on COP26, see this spreadsheet of links to almost 60 recent sources (and growing), organized by date and by the topics below.

Deceit

There are many forms of deceit on the current reality, the goals, and the data used to make plans and measure progress on curbing global warming. These include the following:

The goal of net zero is not clearly defined and easy to manipulate. Working with "offsets' to emissions is like working on a balance sheet financial ledger, and, as in finance, there are many ways to come out with a specific balance using accounting tricks. For one example, see this article on major airlines and deforestation offsets.

Progress reports may be faked or absent.

Plans and pledges may be built on false data about the status quo, and reports inaccurate by design or by sloppy research.

Companies often to not count their full supply chain of inputs and sales in emissions reports.

For a particularly egregious case, see https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/06/10/tar-sands-companies-aim-net-zero-2050-no-plan-extract-less-oil/

"Canadian tar sands producers have committed to achieve net zero emissions in their operations by 2050 to "help Canada meet its climate goal' while continuing to extract and produce oil for the next 30 years.

Five major oil companies, Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy, which extract some of the world's most carbon-intensive oil, announced they had formed the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero alliance on Wednesday.'

Delay

As noted in the article on President Biden above, the rising prices for traditional fossil-fuels, ironically in part driven precisely by successes in limiting investment and production in fossil fuels, raises immediate political pressure for increased production to lower prices. Vested interests and institutional inertia then exploit this to lobby against fossil fuels, while stalling on the new measures needed to rapidly advance renewable energy.

Thus the contradiction of politicians around the world in finding excuses for delays while also proclaiming their commitment to ever-changing targets for doing more "later.' The problem seems to be that later never seems to come. There is always an excuse for putting off action.

For one blatant example of vested interests, see https://www.dailyposter.com/biden-just-nominated-joe-manchin-lite/

"In early October, President Joe Biden and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V) reached a deal to expand a tax subsidy for fossil fuel companies and heavy-emitting industries that invest in carbon capture technology in the Build Back Better bill. Weeks later, Biden announced his compromise framework for the legislation, which omitted the Democrats signature climate policy: The Clean Electricity Performance Program, which would provide subsidies to utility companies for switching to renewable energy sources and penalties for those that did not.

This compromise, which will subsidize the fossil fuel companies that are heating up the planet to invest in expensive and speculative carbon capture technology, seems to have come from Senator Manchin.

. . .

In September, as Congress was hammering out the details of the infrastructure package, Biden quietly nominated Brad Crabtree, a coal ally and longtime carbon capture advocate to serve as the Department of Energy's Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management. . . . Crabtree has served as an advisor to the National Coal Council since 2014 and is the Vice President for Fossil Energy at the Great Plains Institute, an opaque pro-fossil fuel group that has been lobbying in DC for funding for carbon capture technology. "

Equity

There are many different aspects of equity involved in action to curb global warning. These include, at least, the following:

Unequal distribution of transition costs by geography and all the other intersectional divisions among people

The climate debt, discussed under the rubric "Loss & damage'

Inequity of taxation for resources to pay for the necessary investment, both within countries and globally given the rapid growth in illicit financial flows and other forms of tax invasion and tax avoidance.

Inequity in control and access to minerals needed for renewable energy and working conditions there, particularly batteries. See, for example the recent NYT deeply researched investigation of cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

For a clear statement, see https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-11-17-environmental-racism-cop26-failed-the-indigenous-people-of-the-world/

Pooven Moodley, executive director of Natural Justice, an indigenous and environmental rights group based in Cape Town: "The year 2050 is a long time in the future, and when you take into account what the indigenous communities are saying about the four-year gap that we have to transform the way we live on this planet, plus what the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC] is saying about the 10-year window, all we're doing is postponing the urgent shifts that need to happen now.'

Holding countries, corporations, and other jurisdictions accountable

There is no shortcut to accountability. But there are a number of steps that can make a difference, including measurement with multiple ways to confirm its accuracy.

Measurement

Measure progress towards real zero GHG emissions

Measure progress towards maximum use of renewable energy & transition

Measure levels of inequality at many levels

Ways to confirm measurements

Require but don't trust self-reporting

Measurement by satellite

Eyes on the ground (including inspections, whistleblowers, and activist monitoring)

Implementation and enforcement

Pass new laws to require climate-friendly policies and reporting practices

Build effective institutions for enforcement of the laws

Taking the fight directly to corporations -- many of which are more powerful than governments -- can be incredibly effective.

By Donna Katzin | October 6, 2021

https://fpif.org/turning-away-from-fossil-fuels-lessons-from-the-anti-apartheid-movement/

On September 9, Harvard University President Larry Bacow heralded the university's commitment to shift its $41.9 billion endowment -- the largest in the world -- to "a portfolio of investments that support the transition to the green economy.' Two weeks later, September 23, Boston University announced a similar commitment.

The rhetorical battle over turning away from investments in companies contributing to climate change, it seems, has been won.

These moves came after more than a decade of broad-based campaigns against fossil-fuel investments, which at Harvard included petitions, protests, a legal complaint to the Massachusetts Attorney General, and storming the field during a Harvard-Yale football game.

And yet, as activists learned in the decades-long campaigns to disinvest from apartheid in South Africa, the implementation of commitments was often limited by fine-print qualifications or loopholes. Despite legitimate celebration of new momentum, many questions remained unanswered, as detailed in an analysis in Harvard Magazine.

The real test of success must be to what extent resources are actually removed from fossil-fuel production and reinvested in renewable energy.

On that front, Big Oil -- like the planet -- is beginning to feel the heat.

On one day in May, for example, climate campaigners won major victories at Exxon/Mobil's and Chevron's shareholder meetings, shortly after a Dutch court ordered Royal Dutch Shell to reduce its 2019 carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030. Increasingly, investors themselves are recognizing the market risks involved in fossil fuel production. Some companies themselves are beginning to diversify their portfolios into renewable energy.

Yet, as of 2020, only seven energy sector companies had pledged to achieve net-zero emission targets. And despite the fact that renewable energy is cheaper, the fossil-fuel industry is still receiving a massive $6 trillion dollars in government subsidies, according to the IMF.

As the COP26 climate summit prepares to open in Glasgow on October 31, to evaluate progress toward the goals of achieving net-zero GHG emissions and limiting the rise in our atmosphere's temperature to 1.5oC above preindustrial levels by 2050, the odds of success are still small. In August, the UN issued its latest UN Climate Change Report, which the UN Secretary General called a "code red for humanity.'

Yet cumulative pressures can reach a turning point, producing a cascade of effects. Many of us who utilized shareholder activism as part of broader campaigns decades ago recall the days when a 3 percent vote, permitting shareholders to resubmit their resolutions the following year, seemed an insurmountable hurdle. And the oil lobby appeared unshakable.

In New York City, during the anti-apartheid movement, activists led by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) and American Committee on Africa (ACOA) challenged Shell, Chevron, and Mobil Oil for supplying oil to apartheid South Africa -- "fueling apartheid.'

Together we galvanized support for the international boycott of Shell Oil and launched the ImMOBILize Apartheid Coalition to press the companies to stop supplying oil to South Africa until apartheid was no more. We supported anti-apartheid shareholder resolutions, along with frequent demonstrations outside Mobil's 42nd Street Manhattan headquarters and at Mobil-sponsored events, until the company withdrew its $400 million in assets from South Africa.

Elsewhere, other international struggles opposed the corporate quest for oil and fought to uphold peoples' rights, such as the Ogonis' campaign in Nigeria to protect their land, livelihoods, and lives from Shell Oil, and win justice for its collaboration in the murder of Ogoni leaders, including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. Such campaigns highlighted the disproportionate threat of Big Oil and climate change to the planet's most vulnerable communities of color and food systems.

In the anti-apartheid movement, one of the major turning points occurred in 1985, when Chase Manhattan, one of South Africa's major creditor banks, refused to roll over its maturing loans to South Africa -- threatening an international "run on the banks' that South Africa could not afford and sought to head off by declaring a moratorium on debt repayments. The Chase Manhattan moment exponentially increased economic pressures on business and government and intensified corporate campaigns and sanctions that hastened the country's first national democratic elections nine years later.

In 1994, many of South Africa's supporters turned from disinvesting from apartheid to reinvesting in the new democracy through organizations like Shared Interest, which for 27 years has guaranteed South and Southern African bank loans to businesses, farms, and housing builders in low-income Black communities, benefiting 2.3 million people.

As more wealth is concentrated in fewer and larger companies, many of which are actually larger than some national governments, there is even more potential for corporate campaigns to add to the momentum for change from broader campaigns.

The environmental movement draws strength and urgency from the undeniable consequences already being felt not only in the most vulnerable countries but also in rich countries -- depicted daily in the world's media through uncontrollable wildfires and refugees from hurricanes, cyclones, floods, and drought. Spiraling racism and a virus that knows no borders compound damage and reinforce the need to take action.

But the positive vision of a fossil-fuel-free world can and should be sold not only to activists already receptive to a Green New Deal. It also makes sense in terms of hard-headed business logic, which can be understood by corporate leaders who are willing to think long-term rather than only of immediate profits.

As the Carbon Tracker initiative recently pointed out, the narrative of necessary pain to avert climate disaster has been made totally obsolete by the rapidly declining costs of renewable energy. Countries and companies alike must recognize the change for their own advantage, or be left behind by technological innovation.

Coordinated international campaigning of all kinds is essential to accelerate the pace. But the convergence of moral urgency and technological potential provides an opportunity that we must not fail to leverage by exerting unrelenting pressure on those in places of power to match words with action.

Historical turning points are most often visible only in hindsight rather than in the moment.

This can be one of them.

The Biden administration and other governments may make climate pledges. But often it's indigenous-led movements who will see that they're kept.

By William Minter | October 13, 2021

https://fpif.org/indigenous-movements-are-key-to-the-fight-against-fossil-fuels/

Oil is now flowing through the Line 3 tar sands oil pipeline from Edmonton, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin. The 1,097-mile-long pipeline, owned by the Canadian company Enbridge, includes 337 miles in northern Minnesota. It has faced strong resistance for years from indigenous people and other environmental activists known as "water protectors.'

Ironically the tap was opened on October 1, only days before Indigenous Peoples Day on October 11 and weeks before the global climate summit in Glasgow begins on October 31. Ignoring demands from climate activists, the Biden administration refused to cancel the permit. This reflected a pattern in which administration officials seem to be stuck in a pattern of dithering instead of following up climate action pledges with actions.

Public opinion in Minnesota was bitterly divided. Although Democratic voters opposed the project by a 64 to 21 percent margin, Minnesota Democratic Governor Tim Walz and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith have refused to oppose Line 3 -- or even to criticize the collaboration between law enforcement and Enbridge in the violent suppression of protests.

Criminal cases against as many as 900 Line 3 protesters are clogging court systems in Northern Minnesota. And in early October the news emerged that Enbridge has paid $2.4 million to local police forces for pipeline protection, through a state-approved escrow account.

It might seem that protesters have lost this fight against the fossil fuel establishment.

Not so, argued Winona LaDuke, leader of the Indigenous-led environmental justice nonprofit Honor the Earth, in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

"In one narrative, the Canadian corporation won. Columbus conquered anew, proof that might and money remain the rulers.

Then, there's another. That's the Ballad of the Water Protectors -- a movement born in the battles in northern Minnesota and North Dakota, a movement that will grow and transform the economy of the future . . .

The Canadian oil industry estimated that a lack of pipeline capacity reduced the industry's income by tens of billions of dollars before the pandemic started... Uncertainty about Line 3 caused by Indigenous people and water protectors encouraged massive divestment from the tar sands by non-Canadian investors.'

It seems likely that President Biden will arrive in Glasgow with a briefcase full of promises but few credible actions. Legislative action depends on collaboration from holdout Democratic members of Congress, like Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), who are in thrall to the fossil fuel industry.

Executive action is possible but unlikely, with the administration seemingly paralyzed by indecision and resistance from vested interests. And the effects of new petitions from climate groups and demonstrations by climate activists are uncertain.

The measure of progress on fossil fuels, however, as Donna Katzin stressed in Foreign Policy In Focus recently and in an earlier longer essay for the U.S.-Africa Bridge Building Project in May, will be how resources are actually dis-invested from fossil fuels and re-invested in renewable energy.

One factor affecting that outcome that is most often underestimated is direct action led by indigenous people, such as the resistance to Line 3 in Minnesota.

As Winona LaDuke noted, activists succeeded in delaying the Line 3 pipeline by four years. In August this year the Indigenous Environmental Network and Oil Change International released a report on Indigenous Resistance Against Carbon, with detailed calculations estimating that victories against these projects in the U.S. and Canada represent the carbon equivalent of 12 percent of annual U.S. and Canadian pollution, or 779 million metric tons of CO2.

Official commitments by governments adopted in Glasgow are clearly also important, if and when they are implemented. So are campaigns of all kinds to influence the companies themselves to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy. So is the mobilization of youth around the world who are increasingly conscious of the imminent threats to their own survival.

But the decisive factor may well be direct action by indigenous peoples and others most directly threatened, both in their material impact as well as their catalytic effect on wider activist movements.

HD 	SA's Climate-Finance Deal - Opportunity or Trap?

While it is imperative that this new energy deal be scrutinised, it should not be on Gwede Mantashe's or Floyd Shivambu's dishonest terms. Critique must be rooted in the agreement's merits alone.

At the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, the South African government announced a major R130 billion deal with the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, France and the European Union. The climate-finance agreement aims to invest in a just transition to renewable energy and away from coal for South Africa.

TD 
	

The deal is the first of its kind, where Global North countries are helping to fund a just transition to renewable energy for a deeply coal-intensive Global South country like South Africa. It has been heralded internationally as "offering a model of how to end reliance on coal".

Back home in South Africa, the deal received a more mixed reception. Local energy and environmental justice groups have given it a cautious welcome. On one hand, they recognise that this might be a step in the right direction, helping South Africa build a cleaner, more reliable and just energy future. On the other, they worry about how exactly the deal will play out in practice.

More vociferously opposed have been defenders of coal, including the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who have tried to paint the deal as an imperialist act of sabotage to South Africa's economy. According to EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu, South Africa's economy should run on coal for hundreds of years to come, and should not give in to a "colonial take-over engineered by the West".

Shivambu is not alone in brandishing anti-imperialism as a weapon against clean energy. Despite President Ramaphosa and the ANC leadership supporting the climate-finance deal, Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe has come out against it.

At the largely oil, gas and coal company-sponsored African Energy Week in Cape Town, Mantashe gave his first address since the climate finance deal was announced. Seemingly singing from the same song sheet as Shivambu, Mantashe decried the "global anti-fossil fuel agenda", and called on African nations to resist the supposedly imperial clean-energy agenda of the West.

It is a pity that critique framed in terms of anti-imperialism has been seized upon by the defenders of coal, gas and oil interests. There are relevant and urgent critiques of Western climate finance and interests that must be made. There are also important principles of climate justice guiding what the rich and polluting Global North owes to the Global South in climate reparations.

Those vitally important arguments, however, are being perverted by Mantashe and Shivambu, who are twisting the anti-imperialist tradition to defend one of the worst legacies of Western imperialism: the coal-fired minerals-energy complex that was largely forged under apartheid, and which has made South Africa both one of the most unequal and polluting countries in the world.

Shivambu and Mantashe do not want to dismantle that awful colonial vestige. They want to change the elite that benefits from it. They are defending a new elite profiteering from a heavily polluting and highly corrupt energy and mining regime that has funnelled trillions of rands from the South African people into the hands of coal and mining magnates.

For example, the EFF's energy agenda is informed by its partnership with Transform RSA - a shady pro-Zuma, pro-coal and pro-nuclear lobby that has been working to stop renewable energy. As a result, the EFF's energy vision claims to be anti-privatisation, while being all for state-subsidised private nuclear and private coal, and only resisting private energy if it is renewable energy.

Rather than throwing off the yokes of oppression, the dream of Mantashe and Shivambu seems to be to install new oppressors at the helm of a corrupt, exploitative and dysfunctional neocolonial minerals energy complex. Decades ago, Steve Biko presciently warned us about this false phase of decolonisation:

"The whites have locked up within a small minority of themselves the greater proportion of the country's wealth. If we have a mere change of face of those in governing positions what is likely to happen is that black people will continue to be poor, and you will see a few blacks filtering through into the so-called bourgeoisie. Our society will be run almost as of yesterday. So for meaningful change to appear there needs to be an attempt at reorganising the whole economic pattern and economic policies within this particular country."

To support their coal-fired spin framed in the language of anti-imperialism, the likes of Shivambu and Mantashe claim that transitioning away from coal will be "economic suicide" for South Africa. They argue that, like the West before us, we must fuel our economic development with coal.

The outdated idea that coal is our most economic mode of development has been blown out of the water by the reality that renewables now provide the cheapest power across most of the world. South Africa has not harnessed that reality, because years of delay and regulatory sabotage meant that we have failed to greenlight any new large-scale renewable energy projects for many years now.

Now we finally have a small amount of new renewable projects which were approved by the mineral resources and energy department in October. Quite contrary to Mantashe's economic suicide narrative, the projects announced saw new solar- and wind-power projects delivering power at half the price that new coal does.

Our ageing, unreliable and polluting coal-power fleet plunges us into load shedding and has seen the costs of energy rise by over 400% in the past decade. Meanwhile, multiple studies, real world evidence and economic modelling show a renewable energy future provides our most job-creating, affordable and economically prosperous and inclusive future.

Of course, the success of renewable energy must sound like economic suicide for coal workers. They are right to worry, and many have been demanding for years that the government put in place just-transition plans to protect workers and communities dependent on coal, like countries across the world have done.

Yet, for all Mantashe's pro-worker, nationalist and anti-privatisation rhetoric, his department did not use the years of delaying renewables to roll out any just transition plans or ensure any social ownership. Instead, all projects are privately owned and are majority foreign-owned. Local ownership tends to be concentrated in the hands of a few companies and elites - like President Ramaphosa's brother-in-law Patrice Motsepe who benefited significantly.

Mantashe's emergency procurement power programme also saw the vast majority of tenders going to a foreign-owned Turkish powership company, Karpowership, which has been mired in corruption scandals, both in South Africa and across the globe.

It is only thanks to Eskom's renewable energy plans, which it is implementing despite Mantashe's resistance, that we see any socially owned renewable-energy projects coming forward at all. Unlike the department of energy, Eskom is also forging ahead with actual and concrete just-transition plans and projects. Of course it will be imperative to watch these closely to ensure that that pro-worker rhetoric is translated into effective and sustained action.

That the majority of the renewable-energy projects in South Africa are privatised, foreign-owned and foreign-built does raise an important anti-imperialist critique of the proposed international climate-finance deal. With UK, US and European money promised to South Africa, what strings will be attached? The history of the allocation of money to the Global South by the West does not augur well in this regard.

The finance could, on one hand, be a fulfilment of the climate debt that the Global North owes to the Global South, to pay for a just transition away from coal and unlock a renewable-energy future that is more owned by, and to the benefit of, the South African people.

A robust green industrialisation strategy for South Africa, with strong localisation policies, could bring more manufacturing and production of renewables to our shores. Coupled with a strategy for more social ownership, this could unlock vast job creation and economic opportunities much greater than a coal-dominated future would.

On the other hand, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and it would be somewhat naive to dismiss the realpolitik that goes on behind climate negotiations. The West can very well use this money to advance its own interests. So, we certainly need to ask whether the terms of the deal will be used to favour the interests of foreign corporations and governments. The problem is that at this point we just don't know.

The rush by some to unconditionally denounce or celebrate the climate-finance deal is premature, because the details of exactly how the deal will play out are still very thin. The announcement itself was merely a political declaration to develop a plan rather than the signing of a concrete agreement. The devil will mostly be in the details that are yet to be decided and agreed.

What the declaration does say is that the money from global north countries will come as a "range of instruments, including grants and concessional finance" which will give South Africa favourable, below-market rates of finance. Eskom and the Presidency have also both said that, should the terms of the finance be too onerous, they will not take it on.

However, what the Presidency and Eskom deem too onerous should still merit significant scrutiny. The ANC has been more than willing to drive forward a neoliberal, austerity paradigm which happily toes the line to the agenda of multinational corporations and international lenders. On this score, a credible anti-imperialism critique is acutely necessary.

The perilous state of Eskom's finances and the government's commitment to selective austerity have been major drivers of the push for climate finance. However, while R130 billion in climate finance might seem like a lot, in the grander scheme of things, it is relatively small. Trillions of rands are needed to transform South Africa's energy sector alone.

If done right, the international climate-finance deal could be a seed fund to kickstart that broader transformation. On the other hand, it could be a Trojan horse that puts in place structural constraints which inhibit our ability to pursue a much more transformative and radical transition - the sort that is needed, given the speed and scale required to adequately respond to both the climate crisis and the crises of inequality and poverty

We cannot allow South Africa's perceived financial poverty to be used as an excuse to lock us into something which will inhibit greater transformation. After all, South Africa as a country is not poor. Most of our people are, but we are a country of immense wealth too, much of which has been funneled off through the exploitative minerals-energy complex.

Consider the 2019 Special Investigative Unit report, which showed that during the 2008 load shedding crisis R14.5 trillion in overpriced and irregular coal contracts were signed. That is trillions that went to supporting corrupted coal rentiers, which instead could have put South Africa well down a path of a just energy transition.

Likewise, the nearly R500 billion we have spent on the disastrous, dysfunctional and extremely costly Medupi and Kusile plants could have moved us towards a renewable energy future, which provides much cheaper energy. Instead, we are stuck paying interest to the World Bank for expensive new coal power plants, while trying to get climate finance to wind down other coal power plants.

We could also consider that South Africa is planning to invest hundreds of billions in new coal, oil and gas infrastructure, through the likes of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Committee. Perhaps the climate-justice movement needs to ask whether the country really deserves international climate finance, given all that it spends on polluting projects?

Another question that South Africans and the international community need to ask is this: Where will the funding go? Will it go to funding Mantashe's hallucination of "clean-coal" power plants, or the large amounts of unnecessary and polluting gas-fired power plants that his department plans to build? Can we then qualify for international climate finance if we continue to build large amounts of polluting new energy while the climate science says the world must rapidly move away from coal, oil and gas?

Big questions remain about how exactly this international climate-finance deal will play out. What we do know so far is that the funding is intended to be used towards a slate of measures to support South Africa to pursue a just transition to "low carbon economy and a climate resilient society".

The central pillar is for South Africa to accelerate its transition to renewable energy and also invest in technologies like green hydrogen-production and electric vehicles. The plan promises to make all these investments in a way that ensures the economic inclusion of historically marginalised communities and sectors of society.

The deal also promises to invest in economic regeneration and supportive measures for workers and communities whose livelihoods and jobs depend on coal. Doing so aims to offset the negative impacts that the transition could otherwise have. That includes provisions for Eskom to repurpose its ageing coal power plants and retrain and redeploy workers in new sectors, as it is already doing at its "flagship" just-energy transition project: the Komati coal power plant.

This all sounds like potentially positive progress. In the words of President Ramaphosa, the plan provides "proof" that we can take "ambitious climate action while increasing our energy security, creating jobs and harnessing new opportunities for investment, with support from developed economies". The real proof though will be determined in how the deal is fleshed out and implemented.

At this point, It is not clear whether the deal will even materialise, given the resistance from the person who has the most power to block the plan: energy minister Gwede Mantashe. While there may be good reasons to block the deal if it proves too onerous or problematic, we cannot allow faux anti-imperialist posturing to be the reason why we would reject it if it does prove to be a positive step towards climate and energy justice.

If Minister Mantashe wants a home-grown African perspective on climate justice, perhaps he could listen to the people of South Africa. He could listen to the thousands of people in every province across the country who protested under the banner of #UprootTheDMRE. They called for him to step down and for his department to be transformed to ensure a socially, ecologically and economically just energy and mining future. And, yes, that includes a rapid and just transition away from coal towards renewable energy.

HD 	We Need a People-Centred COP26. Instead, We Have an Elite Marketplace

COP26 is full of big boys in small rooms. It needs to be led by the people, not Northern elites with the financial interests in maintaining the status quo.

Half a century ago, the Niger Delta region of Nigeria was lush and thriving. Then, oil was discovered and multinationals like Shell turned up. Fast forward through several decades of exploitation, pollution, gas flaring, and dozens of oil spills, and the area could not look more different.

TD 
	

Today, ash and tar cover once luscious farming land. The fishing industry has been all but decimated. Water has become dangerous to drink with UN scientists finding 8cm of refined oil floating on top of water that supplies drinking wells. The air is thick with smoke. People's livelihoods have been destroyed and life expectancy has plummeted.

Niger Delta communities have repeatedly called on Shell to clean up its mess, but instead of launching the urgent measures needed to save lives, the multi-billion-dollar oil major has instead repeatedly denied responsibility and spent millions in courts in an attempt to evade liability.

This is the impact wrought by one oil major in one region, but it is a microcosm of what the fossil fuel industry is doing to the planet as a whole. According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), fossil fuels are the dominant cause of global warming. In 2018, fossil fuels and industry accounted for 89% of global CO2 emissions. To keep global heating to an already devastating 1.5C, the development of new oil and gas fields has to stop this year. It's as simple as that.

Like with cleaning up the Niger Delta, however, stopping projects in which they have already invested vast sums is not in the interests of the fossil fuel industry's executives and shareholders. And so, while they invest millions in greenwashing campaigns and attempts to confuse the public through notions like "net zero", they continue to pump tens of billions into oil and gas. It is true that they are also investing in renewables, but a 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that less than 1% of fossil fuel companies' annual investments in the Global South have gone into clean energy.

The economic interests of oil and gas majors are simply at odds with the need to tackle climate change. And yet, at COP26, the global summit to address the crisis, there are more delegates associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country. Campaigners from Global Witness assessed the list of participants and found 503 accredited participants with links to oil and gas. That is more than double the 230 approved delegates representing the UK, which is hosting the talks.

That's not to imply that more representation from Global Northern governments like the UK would lead to better solutions. They are already the ones with the most power and that continue to enable fossil fuel companies. They are the ones benefiting the most and suffering the least from the devastating impacts of their activities. They are the ones largely responsible for historic greenhouse gas emissions that are disproportionately affecting the formerly colonised Global South. Although the whole world stands the suffer, it is the wealthy industrialised nations in the North that have the most to lose and the least to gain by taking the climate crisis seriously, at least in the short-term.

Some representatives from civil society like myself have been given observer status at COP26. This is supposed to allow us to participate in and scrutinise the process, but my yellow badge doesn't get me into the areas where the real negotiations are happening. We've been closed off from critical spaces and, at times, had whole sections of the conference cordoned off to us.

To make matters worse, two thirds of the civil society organisations that usually send delegates to COP could not even make it to this conference to enjoy this highly limited access. Despite repeated reassurances from organisers, participants from Africa and elsewhere in the Global South have been denied visas, been unable to access the Covid vaccine, been upended by the UK's changing travel restrictions, or been priced out due to the lack of accommodation in Glasgow. COP is always elite and exclusionary, but this year's conference is unprecedented in its marginalisation of those most affected by the climate crisis.

And so, what we have at COP26 is a lot of big boys in small rooms. We have a process led and lobbied by heavily polluting countries and industries that are more interested in their media image than the hundreds of millions of people that are suffering. We have a fundamentally illegitimate global summit in which the voices of those least responsible for climate change and most vulnerable to its impacts are effectively silenced.

What we need is to completely invert this failed model. Fossil fuel companies and their lobbyists - concerned about their ability to profit - must be barred from negotiations. And civil society groups representing hundreds of millions of people - concerned about their ability to live - must be foregrounded.

We need a people-centred COP that can talk about critical issues of justice and take clear and urgent actions like immediately banning any new oil and gas projects - not the elite marketplace for environmental criminals that we currently have.

HD 	New Tools to Map Flood Risk Will Help Bring Disaster Planning Up to Date

About 90% of natural disasters are water-related - most notably cyclones, floods and droughts.

Since 2000, over 5,300 water-related disasters have been reported across the world, with over 325,000 fatalities and economic losses exceeding US$1.7 trillion. Floods alone account for approximately 54% of all water-related disasters.

TD 
	

In 2020, floods in South Asia affected more than 17.5 million people and caused more than 1,000 deaths. The economic losses are still being calculated and are expected to be in billions of US dollars. A similar trend is observed in East Africa, where nearly 6 million people were affected in 2020, with 1.5 million of them forced from their homes.

Forecasts are key to mitigating the worst effects of floods. However, a global survey of Flood Early Warning Systems, conducted by the UN University's Canadian-based Institute for Water Environment Health, revealed that the majority of flood forecasting centres in flood-prone countries lack critical resources to carry out their functions.

The centres lack the ability to improve the spatial coverage and resolution of early warning systems.

They also can't generate historical inundation and flood risk maps. An inundation map points out the specific area flooded by a particular flood event.

Inundation maps are critical for building flood risk maps. They are created either by using hydrodynamic or empirical models. The hydrodynamic models are data-intensive as they need people to be on the ground, gathering data from river and stream gauges. Empirical models depend on remotely sensed data.

Unfortunately, the Global South lacks the infrastructure and data to calibrate and run hydrodynamic models. Today, gauging stations in North America outnumber those in the 20 most water-stressed countries by more than 10 to 1.

Developing inundations maps at the national level using conventional techniques is a costly exercise. In Canada, for example, it is expected to take a decade and US$350 million to update national inundation maps.

Existing inundation and flood risk maps in most developing countries are out-of-date. They also don't consider rapid urban development or the impacts of climate change.

I'm part of the UN University's Canadian-based Institute for Water Environment Health team closing this knowledge gap. We've designed new tools, namely: a Flood Mapping Tool, which has just been released, and a Flood Risk Prediction tool, which we'll launch next year.

Our new tools will help to create inundation and flood risk maps and bypass the high-cost issue by using big Earth data, artificial intelligence models, open data, and cloud computing.

They will provide critical input to flood mitigation and emergency response, land use planning and investment in resilient infrastructure, insurance schemes, and overall public awareness of flood risks.

Other, similar, online tools include a platform launched by the International Water Management Institute that maps significant floods in South Asia from 1980 to 2011. And the European Commission Joint Research Centre launched an online tool in 2016 which provides free access to global surface water indices.

Our flood mapping tool builds upon these initiatives and improves the spatial and temporal resolution of the inundation maps. We also focus on the Global South as a whole, where the data and information gaps are prominent and annual losses due to floods are high.

There are three actions that governments can take to lessen the damage of future floods:

The tools we are creating will help to provide the critical data and evidence to implement these measures.

The Flood Mapping Tool, is the first to be released as part of the UN University's Canadian-based Institute for Water Environment Health's Web-based Spatial Decision Support System. The aim is to address information gaps in flood early warning and risk management systems.

This Tool generates inundation maps for significant floods from 1984 to the present using publicly available data on Google Earth Engine. It relies on a "data cube" - spatially overlapped pixels of Landsat satellite imagery captured over a period of time. This eventually reveals inundation patterns over space and time. By doing this, it allows the impacts of inundation on various socio-economic sectors - such as agriculture, forestry, transportation and communities - to be analysed.

During the Flood Mapping Tool's two-year design, review and testing process, our team engaged an extensive network of water-related disaster experts and representatives from disaster management agencies from a range of countries. These included Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

Google and MapBox also supported the tool's development through their research and education programmes. The development team also worked with experts at the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center, Thailand, and McMaster University, Canada.

A forward-looking Flood Risk Prediction tool is scheduled to debut next year. It will use artificial intelligence models to generate current and future flood risk maps for three climate change scenarios at the city, district, and river basin levels. The climate scenarios are defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The models will be trained using the inundation maps generated by the Flood Mapping Tool and open datasets including land use, land cover, precipitation, temperature, gender, and age-disaggregated socio-economic data.

Together, these tools will improve the coverage of national and regional flood early warning and risk management systems.

The system will also help build the capacity of flood forecasting centres in the Global South to use artificial intelligence models, big data and cloud computing to analyse the impacts of climate change. This will be done through hands-on training conducted at various water and natural disaster-related conferences, webinars, and summits.

HD 	Fair Tax Plan Could Prejudice Global South

An agreement between 136 countries aimed at forcing the world's biggest companies to pay a fair share of tax has been condemned by critics who say it will benefit richer states at the expense of the global South.

A deal agreed on October 8, and which covers around 90% of the global economy, includes plans for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%.

TD 
	

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which led negotiations on the agreement, has said it will help end decades of countries undercutting each other on tax.

But independent organisations campaigning for fairer global taxes and financial transparency argue it will rob developing countries of revenues needed to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately pushing millions more people into poverty.

Matti Kohonen of the Financial Transparency Coalition (FTC) civil society group told IPS: "In principle, a global minimum corporate tax is a good idea, but only if the rate is right and implemented properly. Under this deal, the main beneficiaries are the OECD - which led the negotiations - and its largest members."

Calls for a global minimum corporate tax rate have grown in recent decades amid increasing scrutiny on the tax practices of multinationals.

The OECD deal, which has an aspirational implementation date of 2023, is designed to set a floor on corporate taxation and stop companies shifting profits to countries with the lowest tax rates they can find.

The OECD says the minimum global rate would see countries collect around USD150 billion in new revenues annually, and that taxing rights on more than USD125 billion of profit will be moved to countries where big multinationals earn their income.

But independent groups say the agreement falls far short of what is needed for a fair global corporate taxation system and has ignored the needs and wishes of developing nations, which rely more heavily on corporate tax than richer states.

According to OECD research Corporate Tax Statistics: Third Edition (oecd.org), in 2018, African countries raised 19% of overall revenue from corporate taxation as opposed to 10% among OECD states.

Critics point out that the 15% floor agreed to is well below the average corporate tax rate in industrialised countries of around 23%, potentially creating a 'race to the bottom' as countries cut their existing corporate rates.

It is thought a number of developing states had wanted a higher minimum global rate.

Civil society groups critical of the agreement also have concerns over many exemptions in the deal - there is a ten-year grace period for companies on some aspects of the agreement, and some industries such as extractives and financial services, are exempt.

Meanwhile, they highlight, only 100 of the world's largest companies would be affected by part of the agreement aimed at getting highly profitable multinationals to pay more taxes in countries where they earn profits. Moreover, the minimum global tax will only apply to companies with a turnover of more than 750 million USD, which would exclude 85-90% of the world's multinationals.

The fact that countries will have to waive digital services taxation rights, which are important sources of revenue for some developing states, is also problematic. And there are concerns that in many cases extra tax paid by corporations 'topping up' their tax bill to 15% will go to countries where they are headquartered. In many cases, this will be in already rich nations such as the US, UK, and Europe.

Chenai Mukumba of the Tax Justice Network Africa advocacy group told IPS: "We have an opportunity to reform the global tax system to make it right for global south countries, but we are settling for so much less. This is a lost opportunity to balance the scales, to put fairness at the centre of the system."

The deal could have a negative effect on African countries, in particular, she pointed out.

Kenya and Nigeria are among four countries that have not signed up for the deal.

"A lot of African countries currently have corporate tax rates of 25-30%. If the minimum rate is 15%, there is a great incentive for companies to shift profits elsewhere," Mukumba said.

"Kenya hasn't signed up to the deal because it is trying to raise revenue from its digital services taxation rights. It may end up buckling to the pressure [to join the deal]," she added.

OECD impact assessment studies for the deal published in 2020 https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/economic-impact-assessment-webinar-presentation-october-2020.pdf showed that developing nations would gain as much as 4% extra corporate tax revenue.

The organisation told IPS this month (OCT) that it is now expecting those extra revenues to be even higher because of changes to the agreement since last year.

However, studies Pillar 1 impact assessment - 04.10.21 FINAL (oxfamireland.org) by the global aid group Oxfam estimate that 52 developing countries would receive around only 0.025 percent of their collective GDP in additional annual tax revenue under the redistribution of taxing rights.

The group also says a 25% global minimum corporate tax rate would raise nearly USD 17 billion more for the world's 38 poorest countries - which are home to almost 39% of the global population - as compared to a 15 percent rate.

Speaking just after the agreement between the 136 countries was reached, Oxfam said in a press release that the deal was "a mockery of fairness that robs pandemic-ravaged developing countries of badly needed revenue for hospitals and teachers and better jobs".

It added: "The world is experiencing the largest increase in poverty in decades and a massive explosion in inequality, but this deal will do little or nothing to halt either."

Despite the criticism, OECD officials are adamant that the agreement will benefit developing nations.

They point out that it does not affect any state's national corporate tax rates, and that the 10-year grace period only applies to a very small amount of income - 5% of the carrying value of a firm's tangible assets and payrolls in a jurisdiction.

Grace Perez Navarro, Deputy Director of the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, told IPS: "The global minimum tax is aimed at stopping tax competition that is causing a race to the bottom in corporate tax rates.

"It does not require countries that have higher rates than 15% to lower their corporate tax rate, it just ensures that those countries will be able to collect at least 15%, no matter what type of creative tax planning a multinational comes up with.

"It will also reduce the incentive of multinationals to artificially shift their profits to low tax jurisdictions because they will still have to pay a minimum of 15%."

She added: "It will also relieve the pressure on developing countries to offer excessive, often wasteful tax incentives while providing a carve-out for low-taxed activities that have real substance. This means that developing countries can still offer effective incentives that attract genuine, substantive foreign direct investment."

But Mukumba said the problem is not that the deal will not bring any extra revenue to developing nations, but that richer nations will get much more out of it.

"Developing nations want a global corporate tax minimum, they have pushed for it in the past. They will get revenue under this deal, yes, but nowhere near as much as richer nations will get out of it," she said.

This is problematic at a time when many developing nations are struggling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and need revenue.

"This [deal] will mainly support recovery efforts in the G7 countries instead of developing countries which have been most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are more in debt, preventing them from generating enough revenues to recover from the crisis and ultimately throwing millions more people into extreme poverty," said Kohonen.

HD 	How to Ensure Global Debates About Inequality Are Informed By Views From Developing Countries

In the last decade inequality has been placed at the centre of the agenda for global social and economic policy. This has been driven in large part by the pioneering work of the British economist Sir Tony Atkinson, French economist Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and the work of sociologists like Goran Therborn.

All of the key United Nations development targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals are informed by, and have as their key targets, the need to address growing levels of inequality across the globe.

TD 
	

Global attention on inequality is also informed by a set of issues that have given rise to more virulent right-wing politics in the US, the UK and much of Europe. This is the outcome of growing levels of inequality and high levels of discontent among so-called "blue-collar" workers, and the consequent rise of identity politics.

But, in our view, debates about inequality have not been sufficiently informed by perspectives from the global South.

If we are to address inequality across the globe the issue of inequality between countries - and the historical and political factors giving rise to this - cannot be ignored.

Given this reality, we have identified four main issues that we believe should drive the research agenda in the global South. Notwithstanding the focus across the globe on the issue of inequality, in reality, very little has been achieved to fix the problem. This is most starkly shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed massive inequalities across the globe.

Part of the reason for this is that the realities of inequality in the global South, and the forces driving these patterns, aren't sufficiently understood. For example, according to the International Labour Organisation in Africa around 85.8% of employment is informal. These workers do not form part of how labour markets are traditionally understood.

Another big difference is that in much of the global North, fiscal transfers are able to improve inequality outcomes. The global South has limited fiscal scope because it lacks the ability to raise large tax revenues.

Based on our insights from setting up the Southern Centre for Inequality Studies, and our first four years of research, we have identified four areas that we believe should be at the forefront of the research agenda of academics in the global South.

We set them out below.

These include fiscal transfers. While important, they are not by themselves sufficient to address inequality. What is needed is a fuller understanding of the political, social and economic factors driving the growth in inequality. This includes how these forces may be different in the global South. Inequality is a global problem, but this does not mean its causes are universal. Inequality is in essence an issue of power, which is socially constructed. For this reason, context matters. While inequality is a global problem, its growth is most pronounced and the political, social and economic challenges it poses are most complex and pronounced in the global South.

One example of these assessments is the Gini coefficient, which measures levels of inequality. These assessments have been useful for measuring inequality but don't offer useful solutions. Inequality studies and policies need to move away from a preoccupation with these measures. This is important if we are to understand inequality as a violation of human dignity. Here, a multidisciplinary approach is called for if we are to solve the inequality challenge. History, sociology, gender studies, anthropology, philosophy, the natural sciences, and health sciences have as much to contribute as economics.

It is for this reason for example that UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima will present the Southern Centre for Inequality Studies' annual Inequality Lecture. Ms Byanyima was previously Executive Director of Oxfam International and director of Gender and Development at the UNDP.

It's important to understand the differences in the fiscal capacities of countries in the global North and the global South to address inequality. High-income countries can ameliorate somewhat the high levels of inequality because they have high levels of taxation and significant state capacity. But this isn't possible in much of the global South - at least not to the same extent. This generates complex social and economic challenges which require policy attention.

This points to the need to understand that inequality within countries is inextricably linked with the forces shaping inequality between countries. The problem can't be solved simply in one geography. Inequality between countries needs to be tackled simultaneously.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp relief how very differently countries are experiencing the burden of the pandemic.

The heaviest tolls have been exacted on the most economically marginalised countries. In South Africa, for example, job and income losses have been most pronounced. Low-paid workers, the young and workers in the informal economy and in service sectors have borne a disproportionate burden of job and income losses. Women, who make up a substantial portion of workers in the services economy, have been the hardest hit.

Countries in the global North have been able to protect their economies from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through a stimulus package of unprecedented levels. The US stimulus package has been estimated at US$1.9 trillion. Developing and emerging economies, on the other hand, have been thrown into a deep-seated economic crisis due to the pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted inequality between countries. This is most starkly evident in the way in which access to vaccines has been determined. This is undermining the recovery in both developing and developed countries and points to the need for inequality to be tackled as a global issue, between countries and within countries.

For all of the excellent academic research on inequality, the COVID-19 pandemic shows us that very little has been achieved at the policy level to actually address the challenge and to move to a more equal world. If we are to do that, global policies have to address the realities of how unequal economic and social patterns are across the globe.

Moreover, the realities of inequality from the perspective of the global South need to inform these policy changes. If we don't pursue such an ambitious policy agenda, the COVID-19 pandemic will be yet another shock, like the 2008 global financial crisis, that exposes the fragility and inequalities in our economic and social systems, but that we quickly forget about - that is, until the next global shock.

HD 	Data Drought in the Global South

In 2020, every human on Earth created an average of at least 1.7 megabytes of data per second, collectively amassing 2.5 quintillion data bytes. Some 90% of the world's total data was created in the last two years alone.

Globally, companies are undergoing transformations including the use of digital technologies to create new or modify processes, culture and customer experience to meet changing business and market expectations.

TD 
	

The COVID pandemic has accelerated companies' digital transformations, and by 2022 an estimated 70% of global Gross Domestic Product will have gone through some form of digitization, the result of an estimated $6.8 trillion in investments.

This exponential growth of big data availability is propelling disruptive technologies like those using artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and cloud computing, which all significantly alter how consumers, industries, or businesses operate.

Data-fueled artificial intelligence applications alone are projected to generate additional economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030. Because of this value generation capability, data is considered the "new oil."

However, the trend from the last decade shows that, just like oil, the hot spots to generate and create value from data are located just in a selected few countries. We are witnessing the creation of a data-impoverished Global South, which cannot reap the financial benefits or use data to address challenges like massive forest fires, water scarcity, floods, droughts, and other manifestations of the changing climate.

It is alarming that, despite the much talked-about explosion in data generation, critical high quality data for global, regional, and national development is lacking. Major gaps are opening between the data haves and have-nots.

Unfortunately, the have-nots include the majority of countries facing challenges like water scarcity, access to clean water, exposure to flood risk, and drought, which require quality data to be generated and processed to create actionable information and knowledge.

Today in the Global South water data collection tends to focus on individual development projects, spawning a patchwork of data sets of short time duration, restricted spatial coverage and limited availability.

This decline is most evident in Africa, where the density of water-data collection networks has been declining over time and falls far below World Meteorological Organization guidelines.

In the last two decades alone, the majority of new stations established to report to WMO's Global Runoff Data Center are located in "new oil" rich countries. According to the WMO database, gauging stations in North America outnumber those in the 20 most water-stressed countries by more than 10-1. Similar data inequality exists for water-quality and water-related disasters.

In the last decade, remote sensing data coupled with cloud computing has shown promise to address the water-data inequality in the Global South and is successfully used to monitor various parameters of surface water bodies over a period of time.

However, the lack of traceable ground truth observations against which to validate the satellite observations is a key challenge, essentially making the remote sensing data unfit to be used as part of water-related decision support systems. Also, the remote sensing data has failed to accurately quantify parameters like precipitation and river flows where the data gaps are most prominent in the Global South.

In addition to the lack of water data faucets, the uncoordinated and unmonitored data generation efforts in the Global South are leading to the creation of data wastelands, where more than 80% of data created is unstructured and random.

Converting this unstructured data to actionable information is expensive; cleansing and deduplicating a record can cost as much as $10. This poor quality and sparse data also impacts AI and blockchain adoption, essentially shutting out the Global South from the economic activity, social and climate change mitigation benefits these technologies provide.

Given the rise in the severity and frequency of water-related challenges, it is essential to address the data inequality-related issues to achieve the water-related Sustainable Development Goals in this decade.

The solution includes Global North leadership in the new world data order to share their data and information-related technologies with the Global South to help generate quality and actionable data at a global and national scale.

The Global North must also commit to water science capacity building by funding operation monitoring, data rescue and update, and training of water scientists. Given the international nature of emerging water resource issues, the commitment and support of the entire global community is required to reverse the ongoing decline of critical water data sets.

The UN Rome-based agencies (RBAs) - the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) - today jointly celebrated the 2021 International Day for South-South Cooperation under the theme "Agrifood Systems Transformation and Voices from the Global South".

Hosted by FAO, this year's celebration focused on making voices from the Global South heard on their challenges, approaches and plans for agrifood systems transformation. Participants in the event discussed how to mobilise synergies, solutions, and skills from the Global South to make agrifood systems more inclusive and sustainable.

TD 
	

"The South is an increasingly dynamic source of ideas, solutions, knowledge and partnerships," FAO Director-General, QU Dongyu, said in a video message. "Together, we can offer the solutions based on priorities and pathways of the transformation of agrifood systems in the South, for the South and beyond the South."

The celebration featured experiences and perspectives from India, Kenya and Uganda, as well as from the Latin America and Caribbean region, represented by the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). Highlighting a number of game-changing solutions that are particularly impactful for the Global South, the event also gave space to build a joint-RBA South-South and Triangular Cooperation (SSTC) agenda on agrifood systems transformation.

"We are reminded that implementing equitable and inclusive food systems will be practically impossible without effective cooperation among Southern countries," said Ron Hartman, IFAD's Director of Global Engagement, Partnerships and Resource Mobilisation. "With the collaboration of our partners, we will be able to replicate good practices and to scale-up research, innovation and advancements in information and digital technology to the benefit of vulnerable populations," he added.

WFP's Director of the Programme, Humanitarian and Development Division,, David Kaatrud, said, "We have come a long way since the early steps of the RBAs' collaboration on SSTC. Our agencies are committed to 'walk the talk' in order to enhance the RBAs' collaboration for SSTC to promote inclusive, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems transformation."

RBA activities on South-South Cooperation

RBA SSTC activities have a catalytic and complementary role in coalescing synergies, solutions and skills. Sharing of knowledge, experiences, technologies, resources among countries in the Global South has an important role to play in bringing effective approaches for more sustainable and inclusive agrifood systems.

FAO

As a facilitator of SSTC, FAO brings together countries that have development solutions with other countries interested in applying them in similar contexts. FAO connects partners through its extensive country-level presence by facilitating dialogue, offering technical oversight, mobilising resources and increasing the visibility of SSTC initiatives.

Under the new SSTC Strategic Framework (2022-2025), FAO aims to expand its partnership base with a diverse group of countries in the Global South to mobilise adequate financial and technical resources to implement impactful SSTC programmes and initiatives.

"We need to be mindful of acting meaningfully and collectively," cautioned Ye Anping, Director of FAO's Division for SSTC.

Over the last ten years, SSTC at FAO has helped more than 70,000 direct grassroots beneficiaries in rural areas, and several hundred thousand indirect beneficiaries. Hundreds of affordable, scalable technological innovations have been adapted to local contexts, and 1,000 trainees from more than 100 countries have attended 48 high-level capacity development events, including study tours, training courses, workshops, seminars, expert meetings, policy dialogues, symposiums, and fora. More than 290 experts and technicians from China have been deployed in 12 countries, and FAO also has strong SST partnerships with Brazil, Egypt, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico and the Netherlands, among others. FAO aims to expand its partnership base with diverse groups of countries and other actors including research institutes, centres of excellence, and the private sector.

IFAD

IFAD believes that SSTC can and does play an essential role in the delivery of adaptive cooperation and peer-to-peer exchanges of knowledge and technology to improve agricultural productivity. As is reflected in the BAPA+40 outcome document, agriculture, food security, nutrition, and food safety are areas of mutual learning and coordination for South-South and Triangular cooperation.

IFAD-funded projects and grants have promoted SSTC as a key mechanism for delivering relevant, targeted and cost-effective development solutions and other resources to beneficiaries and partners across the globe. It is also this recognition that embeds SSTC as a commitment in the Fund's 2016-2025 Strategic Framework.

WFP

WFP, the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has a track record of working with countries when food systems are disrupted due to conflict, climate induced disasters or economic crises. Building on its global operational footprint, deep field presence in over 80 countries and strong expertise in humanitarian and development areas, WFP brokers SSTC to galvanise new, sustainable partnerships at all levels (global, regional, national) and promote country-led progress towards more resilient, inclusive and sustainable food systems.

Over the last decade, WFP has stepped up significantly as an SSTC broker in terms of (1) consolidating WFP's global approach to SSTC, drawing on the findings from WFP's Evaluation of the Global Policy on South-South Cooperation and WFP's Global SSTC Task Force, as well as work on mainstreaming SSTC into WFP's corporate strategies and systems, including the upcoming WFP Corporate Strategic Plan; and (2) supporting host governments to reach and create benefits for the most vulnerable people suffering from hunger and malnutrition across different regions through SSTC.

Since 2019, WFP has established a global partnership with China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) to roll out field-oriented SSTC pilot projects in Ecuador, Kenya, Peru, the Republic of Congo and Sri Lanka as part of WFP's Global Field Pilot Initiative.

Policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis have exacerbated rather than reduced global inequalities. On the one hand, the net wealth of billionaires has risen to record levels since the outbreak of the pandemic (increasing by more than US$ 5 trillion to US$ 13.1 trillion from 2020 to 2021), on the other hand, the number of people living in extreme poverty has also increased massively (by approx. 100 million to 732 million in 2020).

These contrasts alone show that something is fundamentally wrong in the world.

TD 
	

In response to the disastrous effects of the pandemic, there was much talk of solidarity with regard to health support, including access to vaccines. But the brutal national competition for vaccines shows that solidarity is embraced by many world leaders merely as a rhetorical flourish.

The World Health Organization (WHO) made an early appeal to countries to agree on a coordinated distribution of vaccines, with available doses distributed fairly according to the size of each country's population. This has not happened.

By the end of August 2021, more than 60 percent of the people in high-income countries had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, but less than 2 percent have done so in low-income countries.

The European Commission, the USA, the UK, and numerous other countries have signed bilateral COVID-19 Vaccine Agreements with pharmaceutical producers to secure vaccine quotas. By the end of August 2021, more than 400 agreements were concluded, securing over 18 billion doses of vaccine.

The European Commission has so far negotiated supply agreements for 4.3 billion doses of vaccine, equivalent to 8 vaccine doses per capita of the EU population. The UK could vaccinate its population 9 times with the contracted doses, the USA 10 times and Canada as many as 16 times.

Exacerbating the problem for many countries in the global South is the enormous cost of vaccines. The producers do not charge standard prices, but vary their prices depending on the quantity purchased and the bargaining power of the purchaser.

Occasionally, they grant preferential terms to rich countries, while countries in the global South sometimes have to pay higher prices. For example, the European Commission received a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine for US$ 2.19, while Argentina had to pay US$ 4.00 and the Philippines US$ 5.00. Botswana had to pay US$ 14.44 million for 500,000 doses of Moderna vaccine, or US$ 28.88 per dose, while the USA got Moderna's vaccine at almost half the price (US$ 15.00).

While the vaccine pharmaceutical oligopoly makes exorbitant profits, countries of the global South are confronted with falling government revenues and rising debt burdens. The situation will worsen as regular vaccine boosters become necessary in the coming years.

What is tantamount to a license to print money for the pharmaceutical companies is a massive burden on public budgets. In view of this dramatic disparity, the promise to "leave no one behind" of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains an empty slogan.

As an immediate response to the global health crisis, the People's Vaccine Alliance has formulated "5 steps to end vaccine apartheid". These are in line with the demands derived from the analyses in the Spotlight Report 2021.

Increasing global vaccine production capacity, lowering market prices, and substantially increasing public financial support are vital, especially for the poor and disadvantaged people in the global South.

One way to overcome the vaccine shortage is to accelerate technology transfer. In May 2020, WHO established the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), designed to pool voluntary licenses, research and regulatory data. But most countries with large vaccine production capacity, such as the USA, Germany, China and India, do not support the initiative. Thus, it has so far remained without any noticeable impact.

Faced with scarce global production capacity, India, South Africa, Kenya and Eswatini applied for a waiver under the TRIPS Agreement of the WTO to temporarily remove patent protection for COVID-19-related vaccines, medicines and devices.

The TRIPS waiver is intended to enable manufacturers in the global South in particular to produce medicines and vaccines more quickly and at lower cost. More than 100 countries support this initiative, including the USA as of May 2021.

The EU, the UK, Switzerland and the pharmaceutical companies and lobby groups based in these countries are particularly opposed and have so far blocked an agreement.

In this context, the more fundamental question arises as to whether medicines vital to realize the human right to health should be patented at all. Should they not in principle be considered global public goods, especially when, as in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, billions of dollars of public money have gone into research and development?

In another initiative, the WHO and several partners--including France, the EU and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -launched the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and its COVAX initiative.

This has shifted the centre of the global COVID-19 response from WHO to a multi-stakeholder initiative with its own governance and decision-making structure, thereby further weakening WHO's role in the global health architecture.

But with the unilateral approach of the rich countries to vaccine procurement, COVAX has failed in its claim to serve a global coordination function. Its primary task is now to provide COVID-19 vaccines to 92 low- and middle-income countries with the objective to provide at least 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2021.

By 14 September 2021, just 270 million doses have been delivered. To date, COVAX has received pledges of US$ 9.825 billion, nowhere near enough to provide sufficient vaccines for about 4 billion people in the 92 countries.

The COVID-19 pandemic has painfully demonstrated the absence of a functioning global health system. This reality has led to the proposal to create a Pandemic Treaty - a legally binding framework and improved global governance structures for pandemic preparedness and response.

Whether it can actually overcome structural weaknesses of the global health architecture, such as the underfunding of the WHO, is very unclear. Depending on its design, it could lead to an actual strengthening of the WHO, or to its further weakening by outsourcing pandemic preparedness and response to multi-stakeholder bodies with limited public accountability.

Beyond responding to the global health crisis, far more fundamental transformational steps are needed.

An essential aspect of an agenda for change is the shift toward a rights-based economy and a concept of human rights that forms the basis of our vision of economic justice.

To make this systemic shift happen, the trend towards privatization, outsourcing and systematic dismantling of public services must be reversed.

To combat rising inequality and build a socially just, inclusive post-COVID world, everyone must have equitable access to public services, which must be reclaimed as public goods and run in the common interest, not for profit.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres has repeatedly emphasized that human rights must guide all COVID-19 response and recovery measures. This should also mean strengthening the rights of those on the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis.

First and foremost, that means the millions of workers in the healthcare sector, 70 percent of them women. Most of them experience poor work conditions, low wages and job insecurity.

The situation is similar in the education sector. Research by Education International shows that even before the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers' workloads have steadily worsened, while salaries have remained the same or even decreased.

The situation has continued to deteriorate as a result of the pandemic. The global teacher shortage, which the UN estimated at 69 million even before the pandemic, will continue to grow so long as teaching remains to be "an overworked, undervalued, and underpaid profession".

A basic precondition for the adequate provision of public goods and services is that States have sufficient resources. To prevent the COVID-19 pandemic being followed by a global debt and austerity pandemic, governments must be enabled to expand their fiscal space and to implement alternatives to neoliberal austerity policies.

This includes implementing a progressive tax reform, which prioritizes taxes on wealth and high earners.

Over the past year, many UN officials, human rights activists and civil society groups (like in the Spotlight Report 2020) have demanded that the resources of the COVID-19 recovery and economic stimulus packages should be used proactively to promote human rights and the implementation of the SDGs.

During that time, initial studies show that this is rarely the case. A report of the Financial Transparency Coalition that tracked fiscal and social protection recovery measures in nine countries of the global South found that in eight of them a total of 63 percent of announced COVID-19 funds went to large corporations, rather than small and medium enterprises or social protection measures.

Particularly poorer countries, some of which were already facing massive budget shortfalls before the pandemic, need substantial external support to finance additional healthcare and social spending and measures to overcome the economic recession.

In this regard, the general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) equivalent to US$ 650 billion in August 2021 - the largest distribution ever made by the IMF - has been heralded as a major achievement. However, its distribution will not benefit the countries most in need without rechanneling measures and again illustrates existing imbalances in the global economic architecture.

Only if the world collectively embarks on the path toward transformational policies is there a chance to reduce global inequalities, protect our shared planet and make the proclaimed goal of solidarity a political and institutional reality.

The 2021 high-level commemoration of the United Nations Day for South-South Cooperation, organized ahead of the opening of the seventy-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly, provided an opportunity to discuss Southern solidarity in support of a more inclusive, resilient and sustainable future while effectively responding to the global COVID-19 crisis across the global South.

The 2021 United Nations Day for South-South cooperation presented the opportunity for stakeholders to highlight concrete follow-up to the twentieth session of the High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation (HLC), which took place from 1 to 4 June 2021 in New York.

TD 
	

"South-South and triangular cooperation must have a central place in our preparations for a strong recovery", says Secretary-General António Guterres, reminding us that "we will need the full contributions and cooperation of the global South to build more resilient economies and societies and implement the Sustainable Development Goals".

The General Assembly High-level Committee (HLC) on South-South Cooperation met in June to review progress made in implementing the Buenos Aires Action Plan (BAPA+40) and other other key decisions on South-South cooperation.

This HLC session considered follow-up actions arising from previous sessions and hosted a thematic discussion on "Accelerating the achievement of the SDGs through effective implementation of the BAPA+40 outcome document while responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and similar global crises".

The HLC hosted 75 member states - including a Head of State and Ministers from around the world - as well as 23 intergovernmental organizations, 25 UN entities, civil society and the private sector. More than 400 people participated during side events which HLC Bureau Members took the lead in organizing on issues of importance to the South.

Deliberations focused on actions arising from the Report of the Secretary-General to the nineteenth session, which proposed concrete ways to enhance the role and impact of the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, as well as the key measures taken to improve the coordination and coherence of UN support to South-South cooperation.

In terms of important messages and statements, Member States highlighted that COVID-19 has taught the world that South-South development cooperation is critical to an effective response to emergencies.

South-South cooperation was strongly reaffirmed as the means to support countries' national development priorities, alignment with the SDGs, and the acceleration of achievement toward the 2030 Agenda.

South-South cooperation was also recognized as an effective approach to accelerate and deepen the efforts to build back better, healthier, safer, more resilient and sustainable.

It was emphasized that over the past decade, the world has witnessed the increase in the scale, scope, and diversity of approaches of South-South and triangular cooperation.

Countries of the Global South have strengthened institutional capacities for cooperation by formulating and implementing national development policies, strategies, and agencies, and by developing information and performance management systems for data gathering, expertise and technology mapping, and impact assessment.

With the strengthening of national capacities on South-South and triangular cooperation there is opportunity to collect and exchange evidence of how much South-South and triangular cooperation is being done, how it benefits people, and how to create institutional mechanisms to help countries align South-South collaboration with their national and regional agendas.

As the world fights the COVID-19 pandemic and strives to build back better, international development organizations must offer innovative, timely responses to remain relevant. This includes new forms of coordination based on more "coherent" and "integrated support" capable of unleashing change on the ground.

Traditionally, South-South and triangular cooperation has taken place among governments on bilateral terms. As development becomes more dynamic in nature and unprecedented in scale, South-South and triangular cooperation is now used to source innovation from wherever it is.

Also highlighted was that South-South and triangular cooperation is increasingly recognized as an important complement to North-South cooperation in financing for sustainable development.

UNOSSC will continue to promote, coordinate and support South-South and triangular cooperation globally and within the UN system. It will also continue to support governments and the UN system to analyse and articulate evolving and emerging trends, dynamics and opportunities in South-South cooperation.

In response to Member States requests, UNOSSC consistently demonstrates strong convening power across the UN system and serves as secretariat of UN Conferences including BAPA+40. UNOSSC has developed research networks at the global level, compiling evidence of good practices in South-South cooperation toward achievement of the SDGs, and created a global network of think tanks on South-South and triangular cooperation. UNOSSC also offers the South-South Galaxy platform for sharing knowledge and brokering partnership. The Office also manages a number of South-South cooperation trust funds and programmes.

Given UNOSSC's mandate to support South-South and triangular cooperation globally and within the UN system, the Secretary-General requested UNOSSC to coordinate the preparation and launch of the UN System-wide Strategy on South-South and Triangulation Cooperation for Sustainable Development with the engagement of the UN Inter-Agency Mechanism for South-South and Triangular Cooperation, and other stakeholders.

The Strategy's objective is to provide a system-wide policy orientation to UN entities in order to galvanize a coordinated and coherent approach to policy, programmatic and partnership support on South-South and triangular cooperation and increase impact across UN activities at all levels: national, regional and global. Implementation is governed by each entity individually, based on its own mandate and programme of work.

UNOSSC is also currently developing its 2022-2025 Strategic Framework. It is an opportunity for the Office to catalyze the use of South-South and triangular cooperation to accelerate the speed and scale of action towards achieving the SDGs.

For example, the Office aims to offer a platform whereby: (i) countries of the Global South can exchange knowledge, develop capacities, and transfer technologies to address their own development priorities as well as coordinate and co-design solutions to shared development challenges; (ii) UN agencies, programs, and funds can strengthen their support to SSTC at the global, regional and country levels.

No country is too poor to contribute to South-South cooperation for development, and no country is too rich to lean from the South. All partners have important elements to contribute. So, it follows that triangular cooperation is an important element of our work.

The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare severe and systemic inequalities.

The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of the digital revolution. Building institutional capacity in sub-Saharan Africa and LDCs through South-South and triangular cooperation is essential for countries to fully harness digital transformation and recovery.

Triangular cooperation is a flexible platform where partners can mobilize different funding capacities in support of developing countries' priorities.

Triangular cooperation demands horizontality and shared governance approved by all parties. It is based on a clear respect for national sovereignty and the seeking of mutual benefit in equal partnerships.

Recovery from pandemic requires additional support, innovative development solutions and arrangements between public and private sectors. We must facilitate opportunities to expand development cooperation and its processes and to improve the effectiveness of multilateral cooperation. Fostering multi-dimensionality and multi-stakeholders approaches is the way forward to enhance development impact.

During the June HLC Member States highlighted that in the COVID and post-COVID era, the below priority areas for triangular cooperation could be considered: 1) health, 2) data infrastructure, 3) manufacturing capacity and supply chain for relevant medical material and equipment, as well as treatment; 4) solar energy and reducing carbon footprint; 5) a coalition for disaster resilient initiatives; and 6) currency swap arrangements from international financial institutions.

HD 	Climate Groups Call for COP26 Summit Delay Over Vaccines, Costs

November's COP26 U.N. climate summit should be postponed, as an inclusive and safe event has become "impossible", with delegates from poorer nations struggling to access vaccines and pay rising travel costs, a network of more than 1,500 groups said Tuesday.

Civil society activists from many countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America have raised concerns about getting COVID-19 vaccines in time and expensive quarantine costs ahead of the key COP26 climate talks, scheduled from Oct. 31-Nov. 12 in Scotland.

TD 
	

The logistical challenges have thrown their attendance into doubt and Britain as the host nation has so far failed to provide adequate support, said Climate Action Network (CAN) International, which has members in more than 130 countries.

"Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and those countries suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks," said CAN executive director Tasneem Essop.

"There has always been an inherent power imbalance within the U.N. climate talks and this is now compounded by the health crisis," she added in a statement.

South Africa-based Essop called for the negotiations to be postponed until there can be "fair participation from the Global South under safe conditions".

CAN did not suggest alternative dates.

Meaningful representation of those on the frontlines of worsening extreme weather and rising seas is key to securing a "credible" outcome at COP26, CAN said.

Despite calling for a postponement, CAN said urgent climate action must continue and insisted it was not asking for a boycott of the talks.

Alok Sharma, the UK official who will preside over the COP26 talks, said on Tuesday London was "working tirelessly" with partners, including the United Nations and Scottish government, to ensure an "inclusive, accessible and safe summit" in Glasgow.

He said for the first time that Britain would fund required quarantine hotel stays for delegates arriving from so-called "red list" countries, on top of an earlier offer to vaccinate those who cannot otherwise get inoculated against COVID-19.

"COP26 has already been postponed by one year, and we are all too aware climate change has not taken time off," Sharma said in emailed comments.

"Ensuring that the voices of those most affected by climate change are heard is a priority for the COP26 Presidency, and if we are to deliver for our planet, we need all countries and civil society to bring their ideas and ambition to Glasgow," he added.

'RED LIST' QUARANTINE

British officials have insisted the COP26 summit - billed as the last, best chance to galvanise the action needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius - will be inclusive despite ongoing uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic.

Britain has said it wants to push forward work on issues that are a high priority for poorer nations suffering climate change impacts, including finance for measures to adapt.

Climate campaign groups, however, have criticised the British government for moving too slowly on its offer to vaccinate delegates.

In response, the UK said last week it was "on track" to support all those who had requested vaccines ahead of COP26, with the first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine it has shipped to be administered from this week.

First doses of the vaccines would be given by mid-September, with the second doses due in mid-October, to allow a two-week period for the vaccine to become fully effective, it added.

Many developing nations are also on the so-called "red list" of Britain's "traffic-light" system for international travel, meaning participants will be required to quarantine in hotels before attending COP26, whether vaccinated or not.

That triggered calls for the British government to help cover the high cost of hotel quarantine.

Accommodation during the summit is also cripplingly expensive in Glasgow, while uncertainty over whether delegates can attend the event is likely to hike travel costs, many said.

Meena Raman, head of programmes at the Malaysia-based Third World Network, which advocates for climate justice but is not part of CAN, said it was already a huge challenge for officials and campaigners in the Global South to participate in the U.N. talks, even before the coronavirus pandemic.

"This time around it's much worse because of the vaccine inequity. The pandemic is a huge challenge - many of us are very concerned about attending," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding she had decided not to travel to Glasgow.

In addition, climate activists have demanded that Britain and other wealthy governments loosen intellectual property rules on COVID-19 vaccines to boost production and distribution of the life-saving jabs across the board in poorer countries.

Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a key broker of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, said G20 nations should show solidarity and share vaccines equitably with the Global South, beyond just offering them to COP26 participants.

"The right to health and concern for fellow humans lie at the heart of the Paris Agreement - no one is safe until everyone is safe," she added.

A local public interest organization advocating for climate justice has joined the calls for the postponement of United Nations climate talks - COP26 conference which is set to take place early November in Scotland.

Green Governance Zimbabwe Trust (GGZT) director Frank Mpahlo said the current debate around postponement is valid as the Global South which bears a threefold disproportionate impact from climate change induced disasters participation should be guaranteed.

TD 
	

Mphalo said any climate action which further disenfranchises the most affected and vulnerable populations we vident that a safe, inclusive and just global climate conference is impossible given the failure to allow vaccines to reach millions of people in poor countries.

"We have seen the effects of climate change at close quarters in Chimanimani, where even three years down the line people are still struggling to sustain livelihoods as they are still living in makeshift tents.

"So conversations around climate justice will be disingenuous without representation of the most affected populations. Conversations also need to focus on climate action financing particularly to support localized adaptation models for countries in Africa," said Mhpahlo.

A global network of more than 1500 civil society organisations in over 130 countries working together to fight the climate emergency, Climate Action Network (CAN) is leading the global calls for postponement.

In a press statement released by CAN executive director, Tasneem Essop, said the full and meaningful representation of those on the frontlines of the climate emergency is critical to produce a credible political outcome from COP26.

CAN said this exclusion poses serious and long-lasting implications for issues that will be under deliberation at this COP and that are extremely important to developing countries, including on climate finance, loss and damage and carbon market rules, among others.

"Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and the countries suffering from the artificial shortage created around vaccines will be conspicuous in COP26 - by their absence.

"There has always been an inherent power imbalance between rich and poor nations within the UN climate talks and this is now compounded by the health crisis. Looking at the current timeline for COP26 and the logistical challenges, it is difficult to imagine fair participation from the Global South under safe conditions and it should therefore be postponed," said Essop.

"The climate talks are important, but against the current context of 'vaccine apartheid' they simply cannot proceed by locking out the voices of those who especially need to be heard at this time," added Essop.

An in-person COP in early November would de facto exclude many government delegates, civil society campaigners and journalists, particularly from Global South, many of which are on the UK's Covid19 'red list'.

In response to concerns raised, the UK COP26 presidency promised to fast-track vaccines to delegates Mohamed Adow, long time observer of the talks and Director of the Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa has also expressed concerns over travel, logistics and vaccination access for Global South delegates.

"If COP26 goes ahead as currently planned, I fear it is only the rich countries and NGOs from those countries that would be able to attend.

"This flies in the face of the principles of the UN process and opens the door for a rich nations stitch-up of the talks. A climate summit without the voices of those most affected by climate change is not fit for purpose," said Adow.

CAN is an accredited observer to the UN climate negotiations and has been a key player in every COP since 1995, advocating for the strongest response from governments to the climate emergency.

Women's liberation has been co-opted by the forces it seeks to dismantle, but political theorist Françoise Vergès argues that a pluralist, anticolonial version of it is worth salvaging.

This is a lightly edited excerpt from A Decolonial Feminism (Pluto Books, 2021) by Françoise Vergès.

Taking sides

The turn in feminism, from being long condemned by right-wing ideologies, to becoming one of their spearheads, is worthy of analysis. What is at stake in this ideological deployment? How did this change occur? How did we move from a feminism that was indifferent or ambivalent to racial and colonial issues in the francophone world, to a white and imperialist feminism? What is femonationalism all about? How has feminism become, in a significant convergence, one of the pillars of several ideologies - liberal, nationalist-xenophobic, extreme right-wing - that, at first glance, are opposed to one another? How has the issue of women's rights become one of the trump cards played by the state and imperialism, one of neoliberalism's last recourses, and the spearhead of the civilising mission of white, bourgeois feminism? This feminism and these xenophobic-nationalist currents do not profess to having shared objectives, but they do share common points of convergence, and it is these that interest us here.

This book wishes to be a contribution to the critical works of feminists in the Global South and their allies in the North on gender, feminism, women's struggles and the critique of civilisational feminism. I call this feminism "civilisational" because, in the name of an ideology of women's rights, it has undertaken the mission of imposing a unique perspective that contributes to the perpetuation of domination based on class, gender and race. I defend a decolonial feminism whose objective is the destruction of racism, capitalism and imperialism, an agenda I will try to define more clearly.

"Feminism involves so much more than gender equality. And it involves so much more than gender," Angela Davis explains. It also goes beyond the category of "women" based on biological determinism, and it restores a radical political dimension to the notion of women's rights: taking into account the challenges faced by a humanity threatened with extinction. I take a stance against a temporality that describes liberation only in terms of unilateral "victory" against the reactionary. Such a perspective shows an "enormous condescension of posterity" towards those who are defeated. Writing history this way turns the story of oppressed peoples' struggles into one of successive defeats, imposing a linearity in which any setback is taken as proof that the fight was badly conducted (which is, of course, possible), rather than one that exposes the determination of reactionary and imperialist forces to crush any dissent. This is what songs of struggle - Black spirituals, revolutionary songs, gospel songs, songs of slaves and colonised people - recount: the long road to freedom, a never-ending struggle, revolution as daily work. It is in this temporality that I situate decolonial feminism.

Reclaiming feminism

The term "feminist" is not always easy to claim. The betrayals of Western feminism are its own deterrent, as are its heartless desire to integrate into the capitalist world and take its place in the world of predatory men and its obsession with the sexuality of racialised men and the victimisation of racialised women. Why call yourself "feminist", why defend feminism, when these terms are so corrupted that even the far right can appropriate them? What do you do when the words "feminist" and "feminism" are now part of the arsenal of the modernising neoliberal right wing when, even just a decade ago, they still held radical potential and were lobbed as insults? When, in France, a minister organises a "University of Feminism" event in which the majority of the audience is female and claims to be feminist, yet they still jeer at a young, veiled woman and let a man lecture them for 25 minutes (roundly condemned only on Twitter)? What is feminism about once it becomes an exercise in appeasement? If feminism and feminists are in the service of capital, the state and empire, is it still possible to breathe life back into them, by reanimating the movement with the objectives of social justice, dignity, respect and the politics of life against the politics of death? But shouldn't we also defend feminism against the onslaught of fascist forces? When rape and murder are not only acceptable but also encouraged weapons to discipline women? When even being a blonde woman, a mother, married to a man, a university professor, conforming to all of the standards of white, middle-class respectability, is no protection against the explosion of hatred, as we saw with the hearing of Christine Blasey Ford during the debates on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court? Or when various governments across the world turn feminism into an anti-national ideology, foreign to "the culture of the nation", to better repress women? For a long time, I did not call myself a feminist; instead I described myself as an anticolonial and antiracist activist in women's liberation movements. I have been led to call myself a feminist, on the one hand because of the re-emergence of a feminism based in broad, transnational, pluralist, decolonial politics, and on the other because of the capture of women's struggles by civilisational feminism.

Biography does not explain everything, and often, it does not explain very much at all, but in a book on feminism I owe it to myself to say something about my own trajectory, not because it is at all exemplary, but because women's struggles have played a major role in it. I was, for many years, an activist inside women's liberation groups; these struggles were always linked to more general liberation projects, in my own case, to the liberation from post-1962 French colonialism. My interest, curiosity and commitment to emancipatory struggles is grounded in the political and cultural education I received on Réunion Island. As a little girl who was raised in a context where school, media and cultural activities were all subject to the post-1962 French colonial order, my experience was exceptionally transnational. For a long time, I did not call myself a feminist activist, but rather a "women's liberation activist". I had the privilege of growing up in a family of feminist and anticolonial communists, being surrounded by activists of different backgrounds, religions and genders, who gave me an insight into the meaning of struggle and solidarity, and I discovered the joy and happiness of collective struggle. As a teenager, I was the kind of idealist who could not stand the idea of setback and defeat; I wanted heroism and the crushing of the enemy. My parents' answer to my naïve and sentimental idealism brought me back to earth: "They are brutes, fascists, scoundrels. You can't expect anything from them. They don't respect any rights, especially our right to exist." There was nothing defeatist in these remarks; rather, they contained a lesson on another temporality of struggle: iconic, though complex, images of the capture of the Winter Palace, of Castro's troops entering Havana, of the National Liberation Army in Algiers. These were powerful images capable of mobilising my imagination; but if I stopped at these images, I risked living in perpetual disillusionment. Tomorrow, the struggle would continue. I also learned very early on that if the state wants to crush a movement, it will use all the means and resources at its disposal both to repress and to divide the oppressed. With one hand it strikes and with the other, it tries to assimilate. Fear is one of the state's favourite weapons to produce conformity and consent, and I quickly understood the price to be paid for defying these rules, summarised thus: "Don't stand out, don't protest too much, and you won't get into trouble." The Debré Ordinance of 1960 demonstrated this in exiling 13 anticolonial Réunionese activists (including union leaders). The message was clear: all dissident voices would be punished. The Réunionese historian Prosper Ève has spoken of "the island of fear" to analyse how slavery, post-slavery and postcolonialism spread fear as a disciplinary technique well into the 1960s (and, I would add, to this day). Fear is certainly not exclusive to the colonial system, but we should remember that colonial slavery was based on the constant threat of torture and death of human beings who were legally transformed into objects, and on the public spectacle of putting them to death. I learned also that one must use the laws of the state against the state itself, but without illusion or idealism, as understood by the enslaved women who fought to win free status, which they passed on to their children, or by the colonised people who used the colonial state's own laws against it (demanding freedom of the press, freedom of association, the right to vote, etc). This strategy was always accompanied by a critique of the racial colonial state and its institutions. In other words, I understood that struggles are played on multiple fields and for objectives with different temporalities. The existence of a vast world where resistance and a refusal to yield to an unjust global order was part of the worldview that had been passed down to me. It was not when I arrived in France or went to university that I discovered that capitalism, racism, sexism and imperialism are fellow travellers, and I did not first encounter anticolonial or antiracist feminism by reading Simone de Beauvoir; I have been surrounded by it since early childhood.

The false innocence of white feminism

Following Frantz Fanon, who wrote, "Europe is literally the creation of the Third World", because it was built on plundering the world's wealth, and therefore "the wealth of imperialist countries is also our wealth", I can say that France is literally the creation of its colonial empire, and the North a creation of the South. I am therefore always surprised by the stubborn way in which slavery, colonialism and everything related to the "overseas" territories are overlooked in the analysis of contemporary France and the policies of its successive governments since the 1950s. Even more so than the colonial empire, the "overseas" departments (former slave societies or post-slave colonies) are excluded from contemporary history; no text on political issues, whether in philosophy, economy or sociology, is interested in these remnants of the French colonial empire. This implies a desire to erase these peoples and their countries from the analysis of conflicts, contradictions and resistance. What is the purpose of such repression if not to maintain the idea that all of this - slavery, colonialism, imperialism - certainly happened, but by being outside of France proper, it did not really matter? It undermines the links between capitalism and racism, between sexism and racism, and preserves French innocence. French feminism keeps its colonial and slave heritage at a distance. We are supposed to believe that since women are victims of masculine domination they have no responsibility for the racist policies deployed by the French state.

To call oneself a decolonial feminist, to defend feminisms with decolonial politics today, is not only to tear the word "feminism" out of the greedy hands of reactionaries' empty ideologies. It is also to affirm our fidelity to the struggles of the women of the Global South who have come before us. It is to recognise their sacrifices, honour their lives in all their complexity, the risks they took, and the difficulties and frustrations they experienced; it is to receive their legacy. On the other hand, it means recognising that the offensive against women that is now openly justified and acknowledged by state leaders is not simply an expression of a brazen, masculinist dominance, but a manifestation of the destructive violence generated by capitalism. Decolonial feminism leads to de-patriarchalising revolutionary struggles. In other words, feminisms with decolonial politics contribute to the struggle, undertaken for centuries by part of humanity, to assert its right to existence.

One of the significant developments of this still young 21st century, and one that has been growing in strength for several years, is the movement of decolonial feminisms the world over. This current has developed a multitude of practices, experiences and theories; the most encouraging and original are the movements for land rights that address issues in a transversal and intersectional way. Unsurprisingly, this movement provokes violent reaction from heteropatriarchs, feminists in the North and governments. It is in the Global South that these movements have developed, reactivating the memory of previous feminist struggles which have never been lost because they have never been abandoned, despite the terrible attacks against them. Joined by feminists in Spain, France and the United States, these movements declare war on racism, sexism, capitalism and imperialism through mass demonstrations in Argentina, India, Mexico and Palestine. These activists denounce rape and femicide, linking this struggle to the fight against policies of dispossession, colonisation, extractivism and the systematic destruction of the living.

This is not a "new wave" or a "new generation", according to the favoured formulas that mask the multiple lives of women's movements. It is rather a new stage in the process of decolonisation, which we all know is a long historical process. These two formulas - wave and generation - contribute to erasing the long underground work that allows forgotten traditions to be reborn and obscures the fact that these currents have been buried; this metaphor also confers historical responsibility on a mechanism ("wave") or a demographic phenomenon ("generation"). Decolonial feminisms reject these segmenting formulas because these politics rest on the long history of the struggles of their elders: Indigenous women during colonisation, enslaved women, Black women, women involved in the struggles for national liberation and the feminist subaltern internationalism of the 1950s-1970s, and racialised women who struggle daily even today.

Decolonial feminist movements, along with other decolonial movements and all movements for emancipation, are facing a period of acceleration in capitalism, which now regulates the functioning of its old accomplice, liberal democracy. These movements must find alternatives to economic absolutism and the infinite manufacture of goods. Our struggles are a threat to the authoritarian regimes that accompany the economic absolutism of capitalism. They also threaten masculinist domination, which is afraid of having to give up power - and which, everywhere, shows its proximity to fascistic forces. Our struggles also undermine civilisational feminism, which, having made women's rights into an ideology of assimilation and integration into the neoliberal order, reduces women's revolutionary aspirations to an equal share of the privileges granted to white men by white supremacy. As active accomplices of the racial capitalist order, civilisational feminists do not hesitate to support imperialist intervention policies, as well as Islamophobic and even "Negrophobic" policies.

The stakes are high and the danger is dire. It is a question of opposing authoritarian nationalism and neo-fascism, both of which see racialised feminists as enemies to be destroyed. Western democracy will no longer even claim to protect us once the interests of capitalism are truly threatened. Capitalist absolutism encourages all regimes that allow it to impose its own rules and methods, open previously uncolonised spaces to it, and grant it access to the ownership of water, air and land.

The rise of reactionaries of all kinds shows one thing loud and clear: a feminism that fights only for gender equality and refuses to see how integration leaves racialised women at the mercy of brutality, violence, rape and murder is ultimately complicit in it. This is the lesson to be learned from the election of a white man, supported by major landowners, the business world and the evangelical churches, to the presidency of Brazil in October 2018. This is a man who openly declared his misogyny, homophobia, Negrophobia and contempt for Indigenous people. This is a man who openly declared his willingness to sell Brazil to the highest bidder, to trample on social laws that protect the poorest classes and on those that protect nature, and to renege on the agreements signed with Amerindian peoples - and all of this came just a few months after the assassination of queer, Black, elected city councillor Marielle Franco. A simple approach to gender equality reveals its own limits when parties of the authoritarian right and far-right elect women as leaders or choose them as muses - Sarah Palin, Marine Le Pen, Giorgia Meloni...

The organisation opposes the decision of the OEDC to set a global minimum tax rate of 15%.

The ActionAid Nigeria on Saturday commended the Nigerian government's reluctance to sign onto the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, (OEDC) tax deal.

A statement signed by the country director of the organisation, Ene Obi, said the OECD recognises the need to better tax the digital economy and the fact that big tech companies need to be making bigger tax contributions.

The statement added, however, that ActionAid Nigeria supports the reluctance of Nigeria to sign onto the OECD global tax reform deal as it considered the new plan unhelpful to Nigeria.

The OECD consists of two parts, with the first pillar stating that if a company has a global turnover of more than 20 billion euros and a profit margin of more than 10 percent, then 20-30 percent of the profit in excess of 10 percent of revenue will be allocated to market jurisdictions using a revenue-based allocation key.

The second pillar, on its part, sets a global minimum tax rate of (at least) 15%.

ActionAid Nigeria said that in Nigeria, tax regimes are dependent on the benefits the countries are bound to gain.

"The gains may be to maximize tax collection or maximize FDI inflow. However, the current global minimum tax of 15 percent is a threat to both gains," the statement said.

"Nigeria set up rules and regulations with the corporate tax at 30 percent for big and multinational companies. The average Corporate Tax Rate for African countries is 28 percent. However, the 15 percent minimum corporate rate is too low and therefore inadequate to stop the 'race to the bottom.

"The benefits of a proposed minimum tax will be far below what is expected to fund the budget deficit in Nigeria, which will translate to the country's inability to meet up with the fight against poverty and unemployment.

"For a moderate stand, Nigeria, like most other African countries will need the global minimum tax rate to stand between 25 percent to 30 percent above the 21 percent as initially proposed by the United States."

ActionAid Nigeria also said that it is displeased with the negotiation carried out by rich countries for their benefit, adding that the deal calls for all countries to remove their unilateral measures to tax the digital economy, such as digital services taxes, and replace them with the new rules laid out in pillars one and two.

"It is fundamentally unfair to ask countries in the global south to trade-off their unilateral taxation of the digital economy, in lieu of implementing a deal they were not part of negotiating, coupled with the fact that they will only marginally benefit from it," the organization said.

"The fact that this new deal will take effect earliest in 2023 and cannot be reviewed until earliest 2030 is not good enough. Revenues are desperately needed in the global south to tackle the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and to fight poverty and inequality. Companies operating within the digital economy need to be compelled to pay their fair share of taxes," she said.

Recommendations

ActionAid Nigeria in its recommendation explained that while the new deal is disappointing, it underlines the need for more comprehensive reforms of the international tax practices and treaties.

"Such reforms are expected to give countries in the global south equal voices in the process of negotiating international tax rules through e.g., a possible United Nations Tax Body," the organization said.

"This will also give increased rights to countries in the global south to effectively tax digital companies operating within their jurisdictions.

"In conclusion, the current OECD Tax deal is neither beneficial to the country as a tax rate or FDI attractor. The worst concern about it is that it can only be reviewed in the next seven years.

"Hence, it is better for Nigeria and any developing nations to stand away from ratifying it, the unilateral measures imposed through the Finance Act of 2019 and the Significant Economic Presence Rule of 2020 stand to be more beneficial."

The ActionAid Nigeria has commended the Federal Government's reluctance to sign onto the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, (OEDC) tax deal.

The country director of AAN, Ene Obi, said on Saturday in Abuja in a statement that the organization noted that the OECD recognises the need to better tax the digital economy and the fact that big tech companies need to be making bigger tax contributions.

TD 
	

"However, ActionAid Nigeria supports the reluctance of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to sign onto the OECD global tax reform deal," Obi said.

According to her, the deal consists of two parts, with pillar one stating that if a company has a global turnover of more than 20bn euros and a profit margin of more than 10 percent, then 20-30 percent of the profit in excess of 10 percent of revenue will be allocated to market jurisdictions using a revenue-based allocation key.

"A multilateral agreement will be developed and opened for signature in 2022 to implement pillar one, with a view of the multilateral agreement being in force from 2023 onwards. The agreement can then be reviewed earliest seven years after its implementation (i.e., earliest in 2030)," she said.

She also listed pillar two as setting a global minimum tax rate of (at least) 15 percent, which will only apply to companies with a global turnover of more than 750m euros.

She said, "In Nigeria, tax regimes are dependent on the benefits the countries are bound to gain. The gains may be to maximize tax collection or maximize FDI inflow. However, the current global minimum tax of 15 percent is a threat to both gains.

"Nigeria set up rules and regulations with the corporate tax at 30 percent for big and multinational companies. The average Corporate Tax Rate for African countries is 28 percent. However, the 15 percent minimum corporate rate is too low and therefore inadequate to stop the 'race to the bottom.

HD 	Rich Country Hypocrisy Exposed By Vaccine Inequities

Most rich countries have been blocking the developing country proposal to temporarily suspend relevant provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for the duration of the pandemic to more affordably and effectively contain it.

Needed to quickly scale up production and affordable access to relevant diagnostic tests, medical treatments, personal protective equipment and prophylactic vaccines, the proposal - by South Africa and India in late 2020 - is now supported by more than two-thirds of WTO members.

TD 
	

The Biden administration has reversed Trump's opposition to the proposal, albeit only for vaccines. Without necessary complementary measures, and with continued opposition from European governments, the US partial policy reversal has not had any real impact so far.

As the World Health Organization Director-General notes, the pandemic is being prolonged by the "scandalous inequity" in vaccinations. "The global failure to share vaccines equitably is fuelling a two-track pandemic that is now taking its toll on some of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people".

With new, more infectious, even lethal variants spreading rapidly, experts fear the worst for poor countries is yet to come. Meanwhile, vaccines will generate astronomical profits. Soaring vaccine earnings have created at least nine new billionaires, with executives becoming very rich as share prices shoot up.

Rich countries have been hoarding far more vaccine doses than they need. The European Union (EU) secured three billion doses, or 6.6 per person, while the US got 1.3 billion, or five each. Canada got 450 million for 38 million, or twelve each, the UK over 500 million, i.e., eight each, and Australia 170 million for 25 million, or seven each!

With mainly adults vaccinated, the actual ratios are even more obscene. UNICEF found most high-income countries had acquired at least 350% of doses needed. Agreements for vaccine delivery to low- and middle-income countries up to 2023 will only cover half their populations, at most.

The headline grabbing G7 promise of a billion doses actually involves 870 million doses, far short of the 11 billion needed. Some of this involves double-counting: 130 million was previously pledged to COVAX, the arrangement to supposedly ensure equitable vaccine access.

Supplies will not begin until year's end, i.e., after their domestic vaccination programs are largely done. Most are doses ordered well in excess of needs. Clearly, the G7 does not have a serious plan, let alone commitment to vaccinate the world.

Although most EU parliamentarians support the TRIPS waiver proposal, the European Commission (EC), the EU executive, adamantly opposes it, offering half-truths as excuses. European leaders block progress by claiming that increased production and exports are more urgent, and require patent protection.

EC President Ursula von der Leyen sees the pandemic as a chance for vaccine-producing countries to export more, while dismissively asserting that waivers will "not bring a single dose of vaccine in the short and medium term".

Although world-class facilities in the global South have long produced medicines and vaccines, French President Macron added insult to injury. "Can we really entrust laboratories that don't know how to produce [vaccines] with this intellectual property and expect them to be producing tomorrow?".

Now, the EC has legalised world vaccine apartheid by only recognising four vaccines - AstraZeneca (only if produced in Europe), Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Hundreds of millions in the global South vaccinated with AZ manufactured in India and many others will thus be banned from Europe!

By 7 July, more than 3.32 billion vaccine doses had been administered worldwide, with 85% going to high- and upper middle-income countries, and only 0.3% to low-income countries. Africa's vaccination rate (4% so far) is the slowest of all the continents, with some countries yet to start, while infection rates are rising fast.

Thanks to much higher vaccination rates, deaths in rich countries fell from 59% of the official world total in January to 15% in May 2021! The developing country share of pandemic deaths are underestimated at 85%, but nonetheless increasing rapidly.

The United Nations Secretary-General has warned, "Vaccine equity is the greatest immediate moral test of our times. It is also a practical necessity. Until everyone is vaccinated, everyone is under threat".

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed investing US$50bn to help immunise at least 40% of the world population by the end of 2021 and the balance by mid-2022.

Ending the pandemic would accelerate economic recovery and generate US$9tn more in global output plus US$1tn in tax revenue by 2025. Yet, last weekend's G20 Finance meeting refused to endorse it.

Outraged former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has rhetorically asked, "vaccines for all or vaccine apartheid?". Scaling up vaccine production to immunise the world quickly requires unprecedented international cooperation.

Suspending patents can help contain the pandemic, but the selfish policies of the global North have made COVID-19 a pandemic of the South. This is also impeding its end and recovery for all, besides deepening the North-South divide, and inevitably, associated resentments.

Meanwhile, the IMF warns of a 'dangerous divergence' in economic recovery between rich and poor countries. With their limited fiscal resources, high debt burdens and weak health systems, countries in the global South must urgently reconsider their options to address the escalating catastrophe.

HD 	Reuters' Hot List of Climate Scientists Is Geographically Skewed - Why This Matters

AU

The Reuters Hot List of "the world's top climate scientists" is causing a buzz in the climate change community. Reuters ranked these 1,000 scientists based on three criteria: the number of papers published on climate change topics; citations, relative to other papers in the same field; and references by the non-peer reviewed press (for example on social media). The list does not claim that they are the "best" scientists in the world. But the ranking enhances position and reputation, influencing the production, reproduction and dissemination of knowledge.

TD 
	

What matters to us, as global South researchers and practitioners working in the field of climate change, is that the geography of this "global" list reveals a striking imbalance. While over three quarters of the global population live in Asia and Africa, over three quarters of the scientists on the list are located in Europe and North America. Only five are listed for Africa.

The list includes 130 of the 929 authors who are contributing to the current reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, arguably the most influential source for climate change policy. Again, the imbalance is stark: 377 (41%) of panel authors are citizens of developing countries (95 from Africa) and only 16 of these are on the Reuters list (only two from Africa).

Climate change science dominated by knowledge produced in the global North cannot address the particular challenges faced by those living in the global South. It also misses significant lessons emerging from the global South, for example from the intersection of climate change with poverty, inequality and informality.

Reuters maps the 1,000 scientists, making it clear that their location is important, yet it does not reflect on what this portrays. While the list is presented as a neutral, data-driven assessment of the top climate scientists, it is silent on the questions of power, authority and inequality this map raises. Where are the global South scientists, and why are they not featuring in this analysis of influence?

We believe that this inequality in influence is a result of unequal access to knowledge production essentials and processes. It also reflects the unequal valuing of climate change scientists' research focus, which for scientists in the global South is often context-specific, to improve human outcomes and achieve localised return on investment in knowledge.

The list elevates research that contributes to well-established bodies of knowledge on the processes of climate change, and its global and local impacts, much of which has been produced in the global North. Research questions developed in and framed by the global North, for instance questions about environmental perceptions and values, often have limited application or meaning in the global South.

The science that is elevated by the list is not the only science that matters. Research from the global South tends to focus on solving challenges on the ground, drawing on multiple voices in local spaces and including practitioner knowledge, to co-produce solutions.

From our experience in Durban on South Africa's east coast, local researchers, drawing on contextualised and decolonised global knowledge, influence the position of local policy makers and practitioners on climate change solutions. An example is research undertaken in informal settlements by university researchers with communities, which is shaping Durban's climate change action.

To achieve a better global balance of important work on climate change, a list like the Reuters one could include a measure of the localised application and influence of research. What also matters is that the exclusion of ideas inhibits the production of knowledge for globally relevant innovation, transformation and action. Northern literature dominates global thinking and practice as shown through the spatiality of the list, but this science does not always provide globally relevant solutions, and often has limited application or meaning in the global South.

Addressing the global problem of climate change requires an engagement with the theories, knowledge and experiences from all parts of the world. Science from the global South may well provide innovative climate change solutions, but very little of this science makes it into the global conversation. The imbalance in influence, therefore, has implications for both global and local action.

The global South is faced with the most severe consequences of climate change. Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and small island developing states are identified as key vulnerability hotpots. Sub-Saharan Africa already has a large share of the population living in multidimensional poverty. Across the continent there is a high dependence on agriculture which is predominantly rain-fed. Changing rainfall patterns and low irrigation rates are compromising these livelihoods. Rapidly growing coastal population centres are increasingly exposed and vulnerable to rising sea levels.

Much of the global literature is blind to and silent on the lived experiences of the majority of the globe. This includes extreme and multidimensional poverty, inequality, informality, gender inequity, cultural and language diversity, rapid urbanisation and weak governance, and how these intersect with climate change. An incomplete literature will miss important solutions in the global fight against climate change.

The most compelling story in the Hot List publication is the unequal global distribution of knowledge and expertise. But this is not acknowledged, debated or highlighted as a cause for grave concern. It may not be the responsibility of an international news agency like Reuters to solve this issue, but an agency that claims to provide "trusted intelligence" and "freedom from bias" should at least point it out.

It is too early to tell the long-term impact, of course, but May 26, 2021 might just prove to be a turning point in the difficult and urgent fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to have a chance of avoiding a severe escalation of the climate crisis. Pressure on corporations is growing on many fronts, as illustrated also by the June 9 announcement that the Keystone XL pipeline has been definitely cancelled by the developer TC Energy.

TD 
	

And now climate protesters led by indigenous people are ramping up the campaign against a new oil pipeline projected to run from Canada's tar sands to northern Minnesota. The StopLine3 campaign, calling for President Biden to cancel the permit for the project, is also mobilizingprotesters blocking construction, leading to mass arrests earlier this month.

Measured by the "production gap" calculated by the UN Environment Programme with allied research agencies at the end of last year, the immediate impact on actual emissions levels of these recent victories is likely to be minimal. The stated commitments by governments and corporations are falling far short of the minimum necessary to avoid catastrophic consequences, and their actions are even more limited.

Nevertheless, this is a signal that corporations themselves must and can be held accountable. The same applied to governments, the policies of which are still overwhelmingly biased towards fossil fuels by inertia and by current fossil-fuel interests. In the United States for example, Republican opposition and Democratic timidity threatens to eviscerate the ambitious climate actions in the Biden administration's infrastructure bill.

The energy giant's stunning loss was the work of a tiny hedge fund that believes investing for social good is also good for the bottom line.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/business/exxon-mobil-engine-no1-activist.html

[excerpts]

The strategy of Engine No. 1 hinged on getting votes from Exxon's three largest shareholders, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, on its side, an uphill climb since such firms often side with management.

Engine No. 1 held only 0.02 percent of Exxon's shares, giving it a similar portion of proxy votes, while those three institutional investors together accounted for nearly 20 percent of the voting shares.

. . .

Analysts say it's hard to overstate the impact that Exxon's defeat will have on corporations across the country.

In 2018, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street cast an average of about 25 percent of the votes in elections for directors of all of the companies in the S&P 500, according to academic research. The mere threat that some of those votes are more likely to be cast against management will force executives to think long and hard about how to address their concerns, analysts say.

"You've seen that kind of shift dramatically overnight," said Lyndon Park, managing director at ICR, a firm that advises corporate boards on investor relations issues.

Mr. Park, who formerly worked at BlackRock, added: "The days are over where you could think, you know, these guys would give the benefit of the doubt to management."

US-Africa Bridge Building Project

Press Release June 7, 2021

https://www.us-africabridgebuilding.org/news/from-disinvestment-to-reinvestment/

Activist campaigns to force corporations and governments to shift resources away from unjust and destructive systems can make a difference, Donna Katzin contends in the essay "From Disinvestment to Reinvestment." The essay was published on May 30 by the US-Africa Bridge Building Project, a Washington DC-based nonprofit geared toward fostering transnational solidarity primarily around economic justice. Katzin's essay cites evidence from the transnational anti-apartheid movement in the mid-20th century to later social justice movements, including the movement to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy and the Black Lives Matter demands to shift resources from policing and incarceration to investment in underserved communities.

In her essay, Katzin notes that racism, poverty, climate change, and pandemics know no borders. This makes it increasingly clear that the rallying cry "An injury to one is an injury to all" applies to a host of global as well as national issues.

Katzin recently retired as the founding executive director of Shared Interest, which she led for 26 years. She previously directed the South Africa and International Justice Programs of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility from 1986 to 1994. Since 1994, Shared Interest has benefited 2.3 million people by issuing $30 million in guarantees unlocking more than $125 million in credit to South and Southern African borrowers who would otherwise be considered "unbankable."

The strength of her argument was strikingly confirmed just before its publication in what news stories and leading climate justice activist Bill McKibben called "A Bad, Bad Day for Big Oil." At the Exxon Mobil board meeting on May 26, a dissident slate of candidates for the board calling for action on the climate crisis won 3 out of 4 contested seats against the company's opposition.

On the same day, Chevron shareholders approved a resolution for tighter limits on greenhouse gas emissions. And a court in the Netherlands ruled that Shell Oil must drastically cut its emissions over the next ten years.

When asked about this news, Katzin noted that such massive shifts require mobilization over years and decades, and that it is too soon to tell the impact of this development. But, she said, "The May 26 victories may be a turning point in the campaign to press Big Oil to put the brakes on fossil fuels - before climate change becomes irreversible. It mirrors the moment when captains of industry recognized apartheid as a motor for crimes against humanity, and underscores the lesson that reinvestment in solutions is not only essential to our shared future - it is also possible."

Similarly today's activists can confront current challenges like those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic through a combination of boycott, divestment, sanctions, and reinvestment strategies.

"A global reinvestment coalition could coordinate campaigns to pressure companies that use public funds for the development, manufacturing, and production of vaccines, but fail to make their vaccines accessible where they are needed most," Katzin suggests. "They could further require them to "reinvest" by pricing vaccines affordably and delivering them equitably to low-income countries and communities."

Among the tactics deployed by transnational solidarity activists to end apartheid, according to Katzin, campaigns to pressure multinational corporations to withdraw their investments and sever economic ties to South Africa proved especially effective. "These campaigns for disinvestment of resources, mobilizing massive support across the globe, set precedents and provide touchstones for today's solidarity movements," she writes.

Economic pressure through boycotts, divestments and sanctions have been and remain powerful tools to change corporate and national policies that harm and hinder social and economic mobility. However, for these efforts to have a lasting impact, they must be paired with strategies that reinvest resources in disadvantaged communities and countries.

The same message comes through clearly from the Movement for Black Lives and their allies. The message is clear. Organizing to defund entities exploiting, threatening, and imprisoning Black, indigenous, and communities of color. But reducing these destructive uses of resources must be accompanied by positive reinvestment in communities, including housing, education, health, and criminal justice.

The fight against injustice can only succeed if it is linked with a vision of justice. The reallocation of resources is both a means to realize that vision and a measure of its success.

Katzin's essay is the second original essay in a series of essays for a Playbook for Transnational Solidarity. The Project also published a companion essay on May 30, reposted with permission from the Sierra Club magazine, entitled "Redefining the Possible," by Varshini Prakash of the Sunrise Movement.

UN Environment Programme

A digital copy of the full report is available at: http://productiongap.org/2020report

Between 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas production would have to decline annually by 11%, 4%, and 3%, respectively, to be consistent with a 1.5°C pathway. But government plans and projections indicate an average 2% annual increase for each fuel.

Key Findings

To follow a 1.5°C-consistent pathway, the world will need to decrease fossil fuel production by roughly 6% per year between 2020 and 2030.

Countries are instead planning and projecting an average annual increase of 2%, which by 2030 would result in more than double the production consistent with the 1.5°C limit.

Pre-COVID plans and post-COVID stimulus measures point to a continuation of the growing global fossil fuel production gap, locking in severe climate disruption.

To date, governments have committed far more COVID-19 funds to fossil fuels than to clean energy. Policymakers must reverse this trend to meet climate goals.

Countries with lower dependence and higher financial and institutional capacity can undertake a just and equitable transition from fossil fuel production most rapidly, while those with higher dependence and lower capacity will require greater international support.

Policymakers can support a managed, just, and equitable wind-down of fossil fuel production through six areas of action.

. . .

Six main areas of action for governments could help ensure a managed, just, and equitable transition away from fossil fuels that "builds back better" from the COVID-19 pandemic:

1. Ensure COVID-19 recovery packages and economic stimulus funds support a sustainable recovery and avoid further carbon lock-in. Many countries have begun to make investments in areas such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, green hydrogen, and improved pedestrian infrastructure. But if this is accompanied by significant support for high-carbon industries, COVID-19 recovery measures still risk locking in high-carbon energy systems and development pathways for decades into the future. Governments that choose to invest in high-carbon industries to boost economies and safeguard livelihoods in the short term -- perhaps because they see few near-term alternatives -- can nonetheless introduce conditions to that investment to promote long-term alignment with climate goals.

2. Provide local and international support to fossil-fuel dependent communities and economies for diversification and just, equitable transitions. Each country and region faces unique challenges in a transition away from fossil fuels, depending on their dependence on production and their capacity to transition. Inclusive planning is essential, as is financial, technical, and capacity-building support for communities with limited financial and institutional capacity.

3. Reduce existing government support for fossil fuels. Many long- standing forms of government support to fossil fuels -- including consumer subsidies, producer subsidies, and public finance investment -- stand in the way of a sustainable recovery to COVID-19 and need to be ended.

4. Introduce restrictions on fossil fuel production activities and infrastructure. Restricting new fossil fuel production activities and infrastructure can avoid locking in levels of fossil fuel production higher than those consistent with climate goals. It can also reduce the risk of stranded assets and communities.

5. Enhance transparency of current and future fossil fuel production levels. A key barrier to aligning energy and climate plans is the lack of clarity on levels of fossil fuel production and planned or expected growth. To improve transparency, countries could ensure that relevant production data are more readily and publicly accessible. They can also provide information on how their fossil fuel production plans align with climate goals, and on their support for the production of fossil fuels. Governments can also take steps to disclose their level of exposure to fossil fuel asset stranding and associated systemic risk, and to require companies within their jurisdiction to do so.

6. Mobilize and support a coordinated global response. Policies to transition away from fossil fuels will be most effective if supported by countries collectively, as this will send consistent, directional signals to energy producers, consumers, and investors. International cooperation, both through established channels and in new forums, can support a just and equitable wind down of fossil fuels. The Paris Agreement's global stocktake, nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LEDS) offer opportunities to facilitate a transition away from fossil fuel production through the UN climate change process. International financial institutions can help shift financial support away from fossil fuel production while scaling up support for low-carbon energy.

"The hurdle is no longer economic nor technical; our biggest challenges are political. A cleaner future is within reach."

Andrea Germanos, Staff Writer

Ditching fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy in order to keep warming below the 1.5ºC threshold is both "necessary and technically feasible."

That's the conclusion of an analysis released Thursday entitled Fossil Fuel Exit Strategy. Produced by the University of Technology Sydney's Institute for Sustainable Futures in cooperation with the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, the report states clearly that "there is no need for more fossil fuels" because the world is overflowing with renewable energy capacity.

"The world has more than enough renewable energy resources that can be scaled up rapidly enough to meet the energy demands of every person in the world without any shortfall in global energy generation." --Fossil Fuel Exit Strategy

Such a pathway, said Sanjay Vashist, director of Climate Action Network South Asia, would avert a "criminal waste of money" that would "have devastating climate and humanitarian consequences."

A key point in the analysis is that simply stopping the industry's planned expansion of fossil fuel projects is insufficient to meet the Paris climate agreement's temperature goal and would actually "push warming well above 1.5ºC."

With this angle, the new analysis goes beyond the International Energy Agency's report last month calling for no oil and gas expansion in order to meet a goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. That's because even if there were no expansion, the report's projections show, the world would produce 35% more oil and 69% more coal than is consistent with meeting the 1.5°C target.

As such, Fossil Fuel Exit Strategy lays out a dirty energy phaseout with an annual decline of 9.5% for coal, 8.5% for oil, 3.5% for gas from 2021-2030.

A further difference between the new report's 1.5ºC scenario and the IEA report is its rejection of carbon capture technology and bioenergy as well as nuclear energy going forward.

Leaving those sources aside is no problem because expanding efficiency measures will lower overall energy demands, even amid increased electrification. That's because wind and solar power--sectors that are accelerating --are in a position to take over for fossil fuels.

"Our analysis shows that even applying a set of robust, conservative estimates that take into account environmental safeguards, land constraints, and technical feasibility, solar and wind energy could power the world more than 50 times over," the report states. "This is the case even for Africa and India with their growing energy demand."

"With this report, it is even clearer to everyone that world leaders have no excuse. We must act now." --Mitzi Jonelle Tan, Youth Advocates Climate Action Philippines

The report points also to previous estimates showing Africa's potential as a renewable "superpower" because "the solar and wind potential across the continent far outstrip every other region of the world."

There are also global financial benefits to be considered. The report notes that renewable costs are becoming at least cost- competitive with fossil fuels. What's more, investments in dirty energy are becoming "stranded assets ."

The good news is that "the world has more than enough renewable energy resources that can be scaled up rapidly enough to meet the energy demands of every person in the world without any shortfall in global energy generation," according to the report.

Rebecca Byrnes, deputy director for the Fossil Fuel Non- Proliferation Treaty Initiative, welcomed the new publication as providing evidence "that a practical pathway exists where there are no new fossil fuel projects, existing projects are phased out, emissions are kept within a 1.5°C budget, and energy access becomes universal, all while using existing and increasingly cost- competitive technologies."

"The hurdle is no longer economic nor technical; our biggest challenges are political," she added. "A cleaner future is within reach and, while international cooperation is essential for innovation and investment, nation-states can and should act now to regulate fossil fuel production decline."

Referencing the record number of extreme weather events that have battered her home country, Mitzi Jonelle Tan of Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines and Fridays For Future Philippines called the "current level of warming... already hell for us in the Global South."

Tan sharply criticized the possibility of further fossil fuel expansion, saying it "will clearly put us past the 1.5°C limit [and] is a death sentence to the most marginalized people."

"With this report," she added, "it is even clearer to everyone that world leaders have no excuse. We must act now, the science and the people are united in calling for justice."

HAYES: But when Senator Romney was asked yesterday about how the Democrat's climate agenda fits in the bill, he responded, "The Democrats climate agenda is probably something they pursue by and large outside of an infrastructure bill."

OK, here's the thing. An infrastructure bill that is not climate- focused is quite literally not worth passing, probably worse than nothing. Because climate is the central infrastructure challenge we face obviously.

. . .

Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts who cosponsored the resolution for Green New Deal told The New York Times, "The planet cannot survive another successful Republican obstructionist strategy. We have to have climate at the center of any infrastructure package in order to have my vote. No climate, no deal." And Senator Ed Markey joins me now.

SEN. ED MARKEY (D-MA): Well, it sounds to me that they have a package which is climate denial masquerading as bipartisanship. We can't have an infrastructure bill in 2021 that doesn't have climate at its center. And any other bill that we are going to consider that does not have aggressive solutions to the climate crisis will just have that response which I've been giving which is no climate, no deal. That's the only way in which we can respond.

This bill has to meet the magnitude of the challenges which the climate crisis is presenting to our country and to the planet.

. . .

HAYES: Well, you tick through some of the things that are in the sort of initial Biden American Rescue Plan proposal. You know, there's money for battery storage and research on that. There's money for electric vehicle charging stations. There's some talk about that moving to the surface transportation bill, although that's in the weeds. There's a lot of stuff for the electric grid. There's some stuff on clean energy in terms of, you know, renewable portfolio standards, if I understand.

Do you have a sense of what is or isn't out? It's just a weird thing where these 10 senators in a room trading this stuff away. Like, do you -- are you read in on what is in the package or not?

MARKEY: Well, I don't know what's in the package except what you just read about Senator Romney's commentary on it which is that this package will not be dealing with the climate crisis in any significant way. And, you know, the bottom line is, the GOP used to stand for Grand Old Party, now it's -- GOP stands for the gas and oil party.

We know that the fossil fuel industry is the largest single contributor to this party. And so yes, we do need new highways, we do need new bridges, but we also have to have an infrastructure revolution for the energy sector so that we are the global leader, so that the rest of the world says the United States is back and we believe in science, and we know that we can solve this problem by unleashing this revolution.

So that President Biden can go to Glasgow later on this year and say, we're back. We are no longer the laggard, we are the leader again, and we must solve this problem for future generations. That is what this bill must have so that President Biden will have the credibility he needs meeting with the rest of the world later on this year.

Editor's Note: "Fossil fuel companies are having a big reckoning with climate change this week. Shareholders for Exxon and Chevron voted for measures that could force them to take more responsibility for their emissions, while a Dutch court is forcing Shell to slash its pollution." - The Verge, May 26, 2021

TD 
	

It is too early to tell the long-term impact, of course, but May 26, 2021 might just prove to be a turning point in the difficult and urgent fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to have a chance of avoiding a severe escalation of the climate crisis. Pressure on corporations is growing on many fronts, as illustrated also by the June 9 announcement that the Keystone XL pipeline has been definitely cancelled by the developer TC Energy.

And now climate protesters led by indigenous people are ramping up the campaign against a new oil pipeline projected to run from Canada's tar sands to northern Minnesota. The StopLine3 campaign, calling for President Biden to cancel the permit for the project, is also mobilizingprotesters blocking construction, leading to mass arrests earlier this month.

Measured by the "production gap" calculated by the UN Environment Programme with allied research agencies at the end of last year, the immediate impact on actual emissions levels of these recent victories is likely to be minimal. The stated commitments by governments and corporations are falling far short of the minimum necessary to avoid catastrophic consequences, and their actions are even more limited.

Nevertheless, this is a signal that corporations themselves must and can be held accountable. The same applied to governments, the policies of which are still overwhelmingly biased towards fossil fuels by inertia and by current fossil-fuel interests. In the United States for example, Republican opposition and Democratic timidity threatens to eviscerate the ambitious climate actions in the Biden administration's infrastructure bill.

The energy giant's stunning loss was the work of a tiny hedge fund that believes investing for social good is also good for the bottom line.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/business/exxon-mobil-engine-no1-activist.html

[excerpts]

The strategy of Engine No. 1 hinged on getting votes from Exxon's three largest shareholders, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, on its side, an uphill climb since such firms often side with management.

Engine No. 1 held only 0.02 percent of Exxon's shares, giving it a similar portion of proxy votes, while those three institutional investors together accounted for nearly 20 percent of the voting shares.

. . .

Analysts say it's hard to overstate the impact that Exxon's defeat will have on corporations across the country.

In 2018, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street cast an average of about 25 percent of the votes in elections for directors of all of the companies in the S&P 500, according to academic research. The mere threat that some of those votes are more likely to be cast against management will force executives to think long and hard about how to address their concerns, analysts say.

"You've seen that kind of shift dramatically overnight," said Lyndon Park, managing director at ICR, a firm that advises corporate boards on investor relations issues.

Mr. Park, who formerly worked at BlackRock, added: "The days are over where you could think, you know, these guys would give the benefit of the doubt to management."

US-Africa Bridge Building Project

Press Release June 7, 2021

https://www.us-africabridgebuilding.org/news/from-disinvestment-to-reinvestment/

Activist campaigns to force corporations and governments to shift resources away from unjust and destructive systems can make a difference, Donna Katzin contends in the essay "From Disinvestment to Reinvestment." The essay was published on May 30 by the US-Africa Bridge Building Project, a Washington DC-based nonprofit geared toward fostering transnational solidarity primarily around economic justice. Katzin's essay cites evidence from the transnational anti-apartheid movement in the mid-20th century to later social justice movements, including the movement to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy and the Black Lives Matter demands to shift resources from policing and incarceration to investment in underserved communities.

In her essay, Katzin notes that racism, poverty, climate change, and pandemics know no borders. This makes it increasingly clear that the rallying cry "An injury to one is an injury to all" applies to a host of global as well as national issues.

Katzin recently retired as the founding executive director of Shared Interest, which she led for 26 years. She previously directed the South Africa and International Justice Programs of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility from 1986 to 1994. Since 1994, Shared Interest has benefited 2.3 million people by issuing $30 million in guarantees unlocking more than $125 million in credit to South and Southern African borrowers who would otherwise be considered "unbankable."

The strength of her argument was strikingly confirmed just before its publication in what news stories and leading climate justice activist Bill McKibben called "A Bad, Bad Day for Big Oil." At the Exxon Mobil board meeting on May 26, a dissident slate of candidates for the board calling for action on the climate crisis won 3 out of 4 contested seats against the company's opposition.

On the same day, Chevron shareholders approved a resolution for tighter limits on greenhouse gas emissions. And a court in the Netherlands ruled that Shell Oil must drastically cut its emissions over the next ten years.

When asked about this news, Katzin noted that such massive shifts require mobilization over years and decades, and that it is too soon to tell the impact of this development. But, she said, "The May 26 victories may be a turning point in the campaign to press Big Oil to put the brakes on fossil fuels - before climate change becomes irreversible. It mirrors the moment when captains of industry recognized apartheid as a motor for crimes against humanity, and underscores the lesson that reinvestment in solutions is not only essential to our shared future - it is also possible."

Similarly today's activists can confront current challenges like those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic through a combination of boycott, divestment, sanctions, and reinvestment strategies.

"A global reinvestment coalition could coordinate campaigns to pressure companies that use public funds for the development, manufacturing, and production of vaccines, but fail to make their vaccines accessible where they are needed most," Katzin suggests. "They could further require them to "reinvest" by pricing vaccines affordably and delivering them equitably to low-income countries and communities."

Among the tactics deployed by transnational solidarity activists to end apartheid, according to Katzin, campaigns to pressure multinational corporations to withdraw their investments and sever economic ties to South Africa proved especially effective. "These campaigns for disinvestment of resources, mobilizing massive support across the globe, set precedents and provide touchstones for today's solidarity movements," she writes.

Economic pressure through boycotts, divestments and sanctions have been and remain powerful tools to change corporate and national policies that harm and hinder social and economic mobility. However, for these efforts to have a lasting impact, they must be paired with strategies that reinvest resources in disadvantaged communities and countries.

The same message comes through clearly from the Movement for Black Lives and their allies. The message is clear. Organizing to defund entities exploiting, threatening, and imprisoning Black, indigenous, and communities of color. But reducing these destructive uses of resources must be accompanied by positive reinvestment in communities, including housing, education, health, and criminal justice.

The fight against injustice can only succeed if it is linked with a vision of justice. The reallocation of resources is both a means to realize that vision and a measure of its success.

Katzin's essay is the second original essay in a series of essays for a Playbook for Transnational Solidarity. The Project also published a companion essay on May 30, reposted with permission from the Sierra Club magazine, entitled "Redefining the Possible," by Varshini Prakash of the Sunrise Movement.

UN Environment Programme

A digital copy of the full report is available at: http://productiongap.org/2020report

Between 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas production would have to decline annually by 11%, 4%, and 3%, respectively, to be consistent with a 1.5°C pathway. But government plans and projections indicate an average 2% annual increase for each fuel.

Key Findings

To follow a 1.5°C-consistent pathway, the world will need to decrease fossil fuel production by roughly 6% per year between 2020 and 2030.

Countries are instead planning and projecting an average annual increase of 2%, which by 2030 would result in more than double the production consistent with the 1.5°C limit.

Pre-COVID plans and post-COVID stimulus measures point to a continuation of the growing global fossil fuel production gap, locking in severe climate disruption.

To date, governments have committed far more COVID-19 funds to fossil fuels than to clean energy. Policymakers must reverse this trend to meet climate goals.

Countries with lower dependence and higher financial and institutional capacity can undertake a just and equitable transition from fossil fuel production most rapidly, while those with higher dependence and lower capacity will require greater international support.

Policymakers can support a managed, just, and equitable wind-down of fossil fuel production through six areas of action.

. . .

Six main areas of action for governments could help ensure a managed, just, and equitable transition away from fossil fuels that "builds back better" from the COVID-19 pandemic:

1. Ensure COVID-19 recovery packages and economic stimulus funds support a sustainable recovery and avoid further carbon lock-in. Many countries have begun to make investments in areas such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, green hydrogen, and improved pedestrian infrastructure. But if this is accompanied by significant support for high-carbon industries, COVID-19 recovery measures still risk locking in high-carbon energy systems and development pathways for decades into the future. Governments that choose to invest in high-carbon industries to boost economies and safeguard livelihoods in the short term -- perhaps because they see few near-term alternatives -- can nonetheless introduce conditions to that investment to promote long-term alignment with climate goals.

2. Provide local and international support to fossil-fuel dependent communities and economies for diversification and just, equitable transitions. Each country and region faces unique challenges in a transition away from fossil fuels, depending on their dependence on production and their capacity to transition. Inclusive planning is essential, as is financial, technical, and capacity-building support for communities with limited financial and institutional capacity.

3. Reduce existing government support for fossil fuels. Many long- standing forms of government support to fossil fuels -- including consumer subsidies, producer subsidies, and public finance investment -- stand in the way of a sustainable recovery to COVID-19 and need to be ended.

4. Introduce restrictions on fossil fuel production activities and infrastructure. Restricting new fossil fuel production activities and infrastructure can avoid locking in levels of fossil fuel production higher than those consistent with climate goals. It can also reduce the risk of stranded assets and communities.

5. Enhance transparency of current and future fossil fuel production levels. A key barrier to aligning energy and climate plans is the lack of clarity on levels of fossil fuel production and planned or expected growth. To improve transparency, countries could ensure that relevant production data are more readily and publicly accessible. They can also provide information on how their fossil fuel production plans align with climate goals, and on their support for the production of fossil fuels. Governments can also take steps to disclose their level of exposure to fossil fuel asset stranding and associated systemic risk, and to require companies within their jurisdiction to do so.

6. Mobilize and support a coordinated global response. Policies to transition away from fossil fuels will be most effective if supported by countries collectively, as this will send consistent, directional signals to energy producers, consumers, and investors. International cooperation, both through established channels and in new forums, can support a just and equitable wind down of fossil fuels.

And, you know, the bottom line is, the GOP used to stand for Grand Old Party, now it's -- GOP stands for the gas and oil party.

We know that the fossil fuel industry is the largest single contributor to this party. And so yes, we do need new highways, we do need new bridges, but we also have to have an infrastructure revolution for the energy sector so that we are the global leader, so that the rest of the world says the United States is back and we believe in science, and we know that we can solve this problem by unleashing this revolution.

So that President Biden can go to Glasgow later on this year and say, we're back. We are no longer the laggard, we are the leader again, and we must solve this problem for future generations. That is what this bill must have so that President Biden will have the credibility he needs meeting with the rest of the world later on this year.

The world's urban population is projected to grow by 2.5 billion between 2018 and 2050, with nearly 90% of the increase in Asia and Africa. In contrast, the rural population is expected to start to stabilise and decline from 2021.

As the global South becomes predominantly urban, food offers a way to look at development opportunities and challenges, and the political impact and regional economic role of cities in the future. As one urban planner once put it: a city is what it eats.

TD 
	

Understanding the complex, linked challenges of urban governance, development and food systems is becoming more urgent. Food insecurity is rising in cities of the global South, including those in African countries.

It is these complex issues that our new book, Handbook on Urban Food Security in the Global South, seeks to understand better.

Governing food in cities means understanding how cities and their food systems connect. The urban food system encompasses production, processing and packaging, distribution, retail, consumption and wastes. All these activities affect food security, environmental security and other societal interests.

It's not only about how urban households are fed but also how infrastructure, transport, retail systems - both formal and informal - and various other systems influence access to food and affect people's lives.

There is ample food in most Southern and African cities, but many people are unable to access this food.

Recently, the High Level Panel of Experts of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation released a report which called for a new way to look at food security. It retained the four pillars of availability, accessibility, utilisation and stability, but proposed two more: agency and sustainability.

Clearly food security is not about simply producing enough food (availability). That's the way policies in most African countries tend to frame it. In most Southern and African cities the challenge is that nutritious food is unaffordable to most urban residents (accessibility).

Given the nature of the Southern urbanisation, particularly in Asia and Africa, informality dominates in housing, services, economic activity and access to food. Inadequate infrastructure and services means that the price of fuel - including electricity - directly influences the types of food people buy and how it is prepared.

Equally, access to storage and refrigeration plays a direct role in the foods people buy, and how they are stored and prepared (utilisation). Climatic variability, political instability and wider vulnerabilities (such as COVID-19) all affect the sustainability and stability of access to food.

Despite ambitions for greater autonomy for cities in national governance processes, urban residents can't always make decisions about alternative urban food systems. This is as a result of poverty, informality, poor infrastructure and food policies that are oriented towards rural areas.

Equally, cities have a limited voice in how national food systems are designed and function.

In this context of rapid urbanisation, it is now widely recognised that the cities of the South are facing a deepening crisis of poor access to food. This is characterised by growing food poverty, hunger and malnutrition as well as a lack of dietary diversity. Child wasting and stunting are also on the rise. So are vulnerability to infectious and chronic disease and obesity.

Despite donor and philanthropic enthusiasm for further "green revolutions" - using industrialised agriculture to grow more food in the countryside - they not going to effectively feed these newly urbanised populations. Nor will they address the needs of cities whose populations are growing rapidly.

As COVID-19 has shown, urban populations suffer when the stability of the food system is disrupted (as with lockdowns). Equally, poor health as a result of reliance on an inequitable and poorly functioning urban food system increases vulnerability.

The knowledge gaps are many. Hence the urgent need for wide-ranging research in cities of the South to uncover the dimensions and complexities of the food challenge in urban areas. Of equal importance is for cities of the South to see governing the food system as an urban mandate and governance obligation.

Our book does not attempt to provide answers to the complex challenges. Rather, it seeks to initiate a much needed conversation about the intersection between changes in food systems and the rapid urbanisation in the South.

Dramatic changes in cities and food systems means that understanding how the rapidly urbanising populations are going to be fed, and fed well, will be one of the critical development challenges of the next 50 years.

HD 	Covid-19 - Global South Responses Have Shown Up Social Policy Challenges - and Strengths

The COVID-19 pandemic is more than a health crisis. It has also revealed other fault lines such as weak and inadequate social service delivery systems and institutional challenges. The poverty and inequality fault lines are unlikely to be redrawn or removed if new and innovative evidence-based solutions are not found to respond to these interlocking problems.

One of the questions I attempt to answer in this article is what we might learn from social policy and social development responses in the global South to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and to help COVID-19 recovery.

TD 
	

My lens is a southern one largely because the social development approach - and related social protection policies that have come to be the bedrock of government responses to the pandemic - originated in development contexts in the mid and late 1990s.

During the 1990s the exponential growth of social protection policies to reduce poverty, vulnerability and inequality served to reset development thinking and action internationally. Examples of pioneering programmes are child support grants in South Africa and Brazil's Bolsa Familia.

By 2018, over 140 countries had implemented a diversity of social protection measures. Across Africa close to 50 new programmes have been initiated in the last 20 years.

Different strategies have been used such as food assistance, school feeding schemes and public employment programmes. But cash transfers that are paid regularly to selected beneficiaries or categories of people based on an assessment of need have led the way.

Some authors label this a "revolution from below".

Social protection policies have been the bedrock of social policy responses to the pandemic. They have played a big role, protecting people from falling deeper into poverty or from the brink of starvation.

Advocates of social protection in the global South have argued that social policies have had positive social and economic multiplier effects. Evidence from a systematic review of non-contributory social assistance (funded from taxes and or development assistance as opposed to schemes made up of employer and employeee contributions) shows improvements in monetary poverty, education, health and nutrition. There were also improvements in savings, investment and production as well as work seeking and empowerment. The study was done in low- and middle-income countries over 15 years, based on data from 165 studies.

Social protection programmes have come in for criticism, particularly from policy makers and politicians on the right of the political spectrum. They have been accused of making people work shy, and for encouraging teenage pregnancy.

The review found no effects of the payments on adult work effort or increased fertility.

Another study found positive effects on women's and girls' well-being, especially in education and employment, along with increases in women's decision-making power and choices.

Early in the pandemic, countries had to address several questions as the virus spread and lockdowns became inevitable. These included: who needed the most help; what types of interventions were needed; what coverage levels should be; and how long they should be in place.

Consideration also had to be given to what the most cost effective interventions would be, how to ensure accountability of public spending and the long-term implications.

The responses that emerged were largely adaptive, built on existing social protection systems. Most countries increased benefit levels. In others, new beneficiaries were added to existing programmes and new programmes were established, such as in South Africa. About half (47%) of cash transfers are new programmes in 78 countries (reaching 512.6 million people), while one-fifth (22%) of measures are one-off payments.

In December 2020, Ugo Gentilini, who is the social protection lead at the World Bank, and his colleagues at the bank and UNICEF collated the first Real-Time Review of Country Measures to respond to COVID-19 in developing countries. This shows that:

Country-level responses increased significantly, with 1,414 social protection policies planned and implemented in 215 countries.

Social assistance made up close to two-thirds of all the programmes in this data base while the rest complemented these with social insurance schemes and labour market programmes. But cash payments were by far the most popular response in low-income countries (90%) and less than half in high income countries. Social assistance strategies included cash transfers (conditional and unconditional), social pensions, in-kind food as well as food voucher schemes and school feeding schemes.

There were major regional differences. In sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean there was a much bigger emphasis on social assistance. Europe and Central Asia and North America used more social insurance measures.

Social insurance programmes such as paid unemployment, sick benefits, health insurance, pensions, contribution waivers or subsidies were identified.

The overview provided a number of valuable insights and lessons.

The first lesson is that countries with pre-existing systems of social protection and institutional capability were able to scale up more rapidly, and to implement the programmes fairly effectively.

Second, those that had registration systems and databases were able to do so faster. For example, India was able to reach 30 million beneficiaries in a month in the early stages of the pandemic because of effective digital registration and inter-system data sharing. Access to identity documents, mobile phones and bank accounts also facilitated the outreach and impact in India.

This points to powerful innovation that is continuing to evolve in the global South.

The analysis also gives insights into the weaknesses of the current systems. One is that low-income countries with limited resources were more reliant on external resources such as development assistance to fund social protection. Middle and upper middle-income countries had a little more fiscal leverage to do so themselves.

For instance, South Africa, an upper middle-income country with high levels of inequality, was able to fund its relief programme through its own resources. This brought an additional 5.3 million people into the social protection net.

There was an additional factor in the global South that came to the fore during the crisis that shouldn't be ignored. This is the contribution of humanitarian assistance and community level mutual solidarity responses such as food relief that emerged in response to the pandemic.

Bottom-up community social solidarity initiatives have not been adequately documented but played a critical role in some countries to fill the holes in the safety nets.

These are age old indigenous and resilience building systems that should not go unnoticed.

HD 	April 14th the Historic Turning Point in Liberian Politics

two years ago, a revolutionary event happened which altered the trajectory and texture of Liberian history. April 14, 1979, was the first time the working people and ordinary masses of the people stampeded their way on the center stage of history to change the direction of the country.

Even after 42 years, despite political sclerosis in the fatherland, this day remains the summit of the Liberian people's political rising. It marked the beginning of history from below. Here we see the same crude forms of accumulation of social surplus, funds that should rather rack up investment in social programs such as health, education, and the economy to move the needle on poverty and address the structural imbalances of the society, turned into a slush fund for the ruling elements drawn from tax dollars, ending in personal pockets.

TD 
	

For remnants of the ruling oligarchy to whitewash history, they have gone on the offensive to blacken every memory of April 14, 1979. Many have resorted to a campaign of slander and calumny to make the oppressed feel guilty about their quest for social justice. The leading intellectual elements of the defunct oligarchy and other political dinosaurs, with a revolting sense of entitlement, are rewriting history in the most revisionist ways ever imagine. Platitudes such as it was April 14, 1979, which triggered Liberia's slide into civil violence have been the recurring motif of their propaganda onslaught. Void of any appreciation of the social dynamics and the objective contradictions that fuelled the rice and rights uprising, these privileged elites have not recovered from losing the historical limelight, it is surreal that these reactionaries stamped guilty verdict on the progressive class and the masses of the people who took to the streets to free themselves from dehumanization and the yoke of oppression.

In their skewed analysis, while vindicating themselves of all charges, they blame the underdevelopment of Liberia on the shoulders of the progressive forces who themselves were victims of abuse and injustice and thought to struggle for a new nationalism, which put people above clique, the oppressed above the minority, in order to build a society which would reflect the character and diversity of the country.

For starters, revolution or violent social change happens when a particular mode of production comes in conflict with the development of the productive forces. It is this conflict that engenders social change. To put it bluntly, it is not the revolutionary who causes the revolution; conversely, it is the revolution that produces the revolutionary. Writing in the preface of his revolutionary tour de force "the Black Jacobin" the most authoritative source of the Haitian Revolution, the Trinidad Marxist in CLR James emphasized the point when he outlined the pedigrees of Toussaint Louverture, the leading figure in the Haitian Revolution: "Toussaint did not make the revolution. It was the revolution that made Toussaint."

The attempt at blaming the progressive class for the failing of the moribund political establishment is not all that novel in historical distortion, but a dirty page out of revisionism which has become a common obsession. Like Thomas Carlyle, the revisionists premise their naïve assumption on the discredited hero theory of history. This formulation refuses to take into consideration the objective realities and overlooks the masses as an unenlightened mob that is controlled and stresses the subjective factors as the reason for historical occurrences, historical analysis that glosses over the objective factors.

While we recognize the individual as a historical agent, and that it is the human agency that ignites social change. Landmark historical occurrences happen within a particular social milieu through a historical process. To understand what fuels people's uprising, one must analyze the social conditions under which the change happens. To not understand this is not to have a full grasp of the historical realities. Subjective factors play a role in organizing change, but it is the objective realities that push people on the centerfold of history to fight for change. Suffice this to mean that even if the progressive class had not emerged on the scene of history, given that the society was at the tipping point of explosion -- other social forces would have emerged. Nature, as in history, doesn't tolerate a vacuum.

After Tubman's death, President W.R. Tolbert came to power. But by the time he ascended to the highest seat of power, the antagonistic contradictions had sharpened and amplified in Liberia, and the masses could not wait indefinitely. They demanded a fundamental transformation, but Tolbert was impotent -- impeded by political sclerosis--blinded by personal ambition. Students at the University of Liberia and the then Cuttington University College were at the forefront of the revolutionary ferment that had gripped the country. They went forward and speedily organized their news organs and through prose went to war with the CENTURY OLD plus decades' political establishment, writing extensively about the decayed Liberian state.

We note when William VS Tubman died, elements from the conservative wing of the True Whig Party didn't want Tolbert to succeed him, although the latter was the next in succession. Initially, they opted for the servile Chief Justice James A. A. Pierre, who represented their interests. However, fearing internal wrangling could lead to fatal purges triggering a catastrophic blowback; they walked back the plan and then settled on William Tolbert. When Tolbert ascended to power, watching the mood in the country, he pivoted to the progressive forces, at the same time reassuring elements of the conservative wing that nothing would change. Tolbert bandied in progressive rhetoric and refused to accompany this rhetoric with decisive action.

Further, he pushed the masses forward with his speeches of hope and change but refused to go with them in history. His problem was that he overlooked the fact that the contradictions in the country were so irreconcilable that the interests of the conservative wing of his party and that of the broader population were not the same. The choices were to go with the progressive elements or outmaneuvered the conservative forces in his party, or stick with the former and drown in his call for social change. Tolbert stuck to the middle ground. By then, the genie was out of the bottle. Change, the masses of the people were pressing for a progressive future, and they never intended to retreat.

William R. Tolbert was by now a conflicted and contradictory figure. He behaved like a progressive in the Nonaligned Movement and pretended he wanted a root-and-branch transformation of the third world, but he was an ardent political figure who supported the CIA-backed UNITA against the MPLA in Angola. He ignored the 1969 Lusaka Manifesto of the OAU, which stated that before the apartheid regime reached out to other African countries in diplomatic collaboration, it must first seek dialogue with the elements of the ANC who were fighting against the minority rule in South Africa. He would go from not only violating that sacred manifesto that all independent African countries agreed to, but he also invited John Vorster, one of the most vulgar architects of apartheid on Liberian soil because Tolbert fancied himself winning the coveted Nobel Peace Prize if he were to start a phony dialogue between Vorster and the ANC outside of the official structure of the OAU. Like his protégé Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, he was a slave to self-interest! Meanwhile, Ahmed Sekou Toure and others were taken aback by the dangerous game Pres. Tolbert was playing.

Equally important, it would be instructive to point out that the super structural institutions that maintained and justified the hold of the true Whig party in power were in three forms: the Masonic craft, elitist social formations, and close-knit family relations predicated upon membership by birth or marriage into the clique. Like every minority ruling clique, this was the way the True Whig Party governed the republic, monopolized privilege in the political, social and economic realms and promoted an artificial improvisation or the co-optation of certain sons and daughters of the tribal people to present the farce that their leadership encompasses the tribal majority. We note that such a move was not based on an honest effort at inclusion, but a charade to get legitimacy from the dominated masses. This narrow individualism and co-optation of tribal chiefs in the state bureaucracy created a short-lived legitimacy, but it was not enough to save the wretched regime from reckoning with the masses. The contradictions of the domination of the ruling clique to the exclusion and utter neglect of the whole nation sapped the creation of a nation. It is this antagonistic contradiction that led to April 14, 1979, which was, not by design, but as a matter of antagonistic historical contradiction.

Tolbert was never a great leader. Being on the left of Tubman doesn't make him great or progressive. If Tubman was a rancid reactionary, anybody to his left was equally reactionary. Tolbert didn't act when he needed to act. His so-called progressive rhetoric was not one thought about, but a product of historical opportunism, as the progressive forces had animated a radical consciousness in the country. It was against that background he doled out rhetoric he was never willing to match with actions, as the motto of his party stated--deeds, not words. For him, it was words, words, but no deeds. In his speeches, he pretended to show antipathy for the social dysfunction that had stunted the population, but he serially exploited native virgins to meet his baser occultist fantasies. What kind of progressive president who was hell-bent on transformation would dot his family members across key sectors of the government? Tolbert masked himself through rhetorical forces to appear progressive. But a deeper and critical look at the man, he was nothing but a political trickster who was playing at being a reformist leader. In short, there was a big gulf between his public rhetoric and his private conduct.

In the campaign of falsification, the remnants of the oligarchy peddle the myth about the glorious "normal days" and want a return to that past. They would purvey the lies that everything was working well in Liberia until the progressive class stopped the natural flow of the society. Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is Liberia was never a paradise in which the "nefarious forces" came and disrupted the great establishment. On a closer look, this vantage point is part of a treacherous scheme to score cheap political points. Going back to normal days means giving the pre-1980 ruling group state power because they are the only group who can fix the country.

Normal days, as we know it, were not normal. It was the period of the centralization, concentration, and monopolization of privilege and power in the hands of a discredited clique that was politically impotent that their only method of governance was to impose social control by using the coercive force of the state through the network of spies and cutthroats. This was the period when the vast majority of the people were mistreated, marginalized and objectified, while afflicted by the most despicable form of social diseases such as breath-taking inequality, economic exclusion, and maximum authoritarianism that reduced most of the people to a subhuman status. With these points, it is absolute poppycock for anyone to imagine a retreat to normal days. Normal days brought the people mystery, deprivation, and backwardness. It is the excesses of a normal day, the organization of the state in pursuit of the interests of the minority responsible for the daunting challenges of today.

In this epoch, Liberia, as we know it, is nothing short of appalling. The country is governed by the neo-Nero in George Weah, who epitomizes the rottenness, debauchery, and indiscipline of this rotten Liberian society. Notwithstanding, our quest for a better society cannot be the mere reinvention of the discredited past, complete with structural inequalities and brutal domination. If we must move Liberia forward to a glorious future, that past cannot be a blueprint because it kept us wallowing in the cesspool of underdevelopment and backwardness. Now is the time for radical imaginations. The future of plenty and abundance created through the usage of social surplus to benefit the whole people. That future can only come not by returning to proverbial Egypt. Neither can we accomplish it through the creation of a monstrous bureaucracy that stifles progressive imaginations, but a future where the people are conscious and enlightened and at the forefront of the historical march.

April 14, 1979, was not just about rice, although rice may have spurred the rising. It was about dignity, about decency, and about a new Liberian project which reflects the character of the country and brings all together under the national mosaic and to fight for a progressive future. The tribal majority, as an oppressed group, dreamed of a better Liberia and it was for the actualization of that dream they took to the streets. This longing for dignity and humaneness against the debasement, dehumanization, and national neglect was the basis for the action. That PAL and MOJA studied the contradictions in the country and created platforms to thrust the people into history are in tandem with all historical struggles in the Global South. It is a truism that throughout history, political movements rise to the occasion and absorb the rage of the people and organize them to fight for a better world. The likes of Mathew, Tipoteh, Fahnbulleh, Sawyer, Mayson, Karn Carlor and Oscar Quiah represented the blistering aspiration of the people.

During the reign of the true Whig party, what we had in Liberia was settler-colonialism. In contrast to the other guise of this coercive form of domination, ours was not based on Caucasians coming to the country to settle and serve as the ruling class and tied to international capital. It was freed slaves who themselves, with abject regularity, consumed the meal of marginalization and subjugation or their parents did, who came and reproduced the society in Liberia which they and their forefathers rejected. They came not hoping to build a society, but to burn society, atomize the people on tribal, sectarian, and ethnic lines. They were not interested in building a nation but reinventing the feudal society where the overlords govern over the serfs. Elements in their group such as Edward Wilmot Blyden, T. R. Bracewell, Edwin J. Barclay, and many others warned them, but they didn't listen.

Since independence, the ruling elites in the republic boycotted the masses. Attempts at inclusion were perfunctory, and at worst minuscule, but came with a political tag. The assimilation of chiefs under Tubman's unification charade was more about using the former as a brake on any uprising of the people, a desperate attempt at political legitimacy, and a decision to widen the revenue base of the country, while the people live in poverty, mystery, and inequality. Many events in the country signaled that reality. One very glaring one was how the illiterate masses, steeped in superstition, amassed to rally funds under the banner of the Citizens of Liberia in Defense of Albert Porte (COLIDAP). That was the closest the people came to April 14, 1979. It was the signal that old men and women who thought they would govern over the people without a fight back didn't understand that they were on borrowed time. That it was just a matter of time that the people would have settled historical contradictions outside of the rigged system of the state.

The case between Albert Porte and Stephen Tolbert cancels out any claim that Tolbert was a progressive. The humiliation of Porte, his constant harassment, the butchering of every elementary legal principle to stamp on him with a guilty verdict showed that the ruling elements had reached the point of saturated degeneracy and political bankruptcy. They couldn't have changed. For the people to rally behind Porte, who were a Congau man, and Porte also opposed elements of his tribal extraction, the story offers a key historical lesson. One, it was not about native and Congau--the struggle was about the ruling elements and the oppressed strata. It was a class struggle- nothing more, nothing less!

Here is a global context: The decades of the 60s and 70s saw the rising of the Third World. Colonialism everywhere was on the retreat. A new form of politics had emerged. The masses of the Third World had entered history and their advanced layers were preaching pan-Africanism, black radicalism, and socialism. The masses in the Global South were challenging imperialism and its local lackeys. In places such as Vietnam people formed a peasant army to fight imperialism on the battlefield, and they defeated it--French, British and American imperialism were all routed. In parts of Africa, everywhere, the masses of the Global South had awakened to a new consciousness where they were confronting discredited regimes. It was the 20th century, the century of anti-colonial struggle. The demands and happenings in Liberia were not in a vacuum.

The hope of a new future is even now more relevant than it was over 40 years ago. The masses of people are still rehearsing the demands. They yearn for a better society, a new socio-economic order which addresses structural inequalities and the vulnerabilities of the working people and oppressed. Truly, all about building a bold new society for a progressive order, bordering on national inclusion, and the redistribution of social surplus. Today, we must not retreat from those demands. We must take those demands and pin them on the door of the national discourse.

I observed the Group of 77 (G77) shortly after the 1964 Geneva Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the 1968 UNCTAD 2 in New Delhi and the 1972 UNCTAD 3 in Santiago. The Group was influential at the time, benefiting from several factors helpful for its functioning which are no longer present, namely:

High level leadership.

TD 
	

Major developing countries and their leaders, who spearheaded the establishment and rise of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and then of G77, maintained close interest in activities of the two groupings. They also believed in the importance of collective action of the Global South at the UN, and provided high level political drive and direction. This kind of involvement of leaders has not been common recently.

UNCTAD Secretariat support.

The G77 enjoyed substantive and logistical back-up from the UNCTAD secretariat in Geneva, and in New York where its Division on Development Finance was located. This secretariat was staffed by committed personalities, both from the North and the South, with required expertise and political outlook.

The UNCTAD secretariat acted as a "public service" offered by the UN to developing countries to assist them in their unequal, political and economic encounter with the B Group of developed countries, who controlled the world economy and were unhappy to see the Third World pressing its demands in an organized manner in the UN.

The UNCTAD secretariat also provided G77 with intellectual back-up, and assisted it to mount initiatives in trade, finance and development fields. It also offered the infrastructure, logistical and administrative support necessary for Group's functioning.

Following the launch of the New International Economic Order (NIEO) in the General Assembly, and of other joint NAM - G77 initiatives when the two groupings worked closely together, the B Group launched a drive to weaken and gradually end UNCTAD secretariat's support for developing countries' group actions arguing that this favouritism was contrary to the "neutral" posture international civil servants were required to assume in the North-South tug-of-war.

Focussed, limited of agenda.

In the beginning, the G77 agenda was focussed on trade and development within purview of UNCTAD. This helped the Group evolve its positions on key items of interest to developing countries, i.e. commodities, manufactures, invisibles, development finance, transfer of technology, restrictive business practices, as well as to organize its work, to involve developing countries governments in Group action, and to mobilize expertise and human resources required.

Activities of the Group were structured by Trade and Development Board, standing committees and conferences held every four years, patterned on the1964 Geneva Conference.

This provided a framework and timetable for a continuing process and a set of objectives for Group's work. As the principal locus of G77 activities gradually shifted to UN HQs in New York in early 1970s and scope of its work diversified, the Group was not able to evolve its own strong support structure needed to cope with many demands of the wide-ranging UN agenda.

A few years later, I was on the South Centre staff when it cooperated closely with the Group of 77 (1991-2005), as well as with NAM, during the chairmanships of Indonesia and Colombia (1992-1998). To the extent of its limited capacities, the Centre served as their detached "outfit" to undertake assignments.

There was a demand for Centre's "pro bono" services and its contributions were used and appreciated, illustrating the need for continuous substantive support for both G77 and NAM in their work.

Today, the twin groupings of the Global South confront a wide-ranging global agenda, acting on two parallel tracks: G77 is predominantly concerned with the socio-economic questions, while NAM is focussed on political and security issues.

The two domains overlap and are interrelated, and should be dealt with in an integrated, coordinated manner. While the relations between them are cordial, coordination is ad hoc and close working relations needed to deal with these questions are lacking.

It is not easy to keep up successfully with demands that the panoply of issues on UN agenda present, more so as the Global South does not have its own organization to back it up.

The G77 relies on the support of its own valiant very small technical secretariat and keeper of its institutional memory, which however does not have substantive capacities necessary to deal with multiple needs.

NAM, in turn, has traditionally eschewed having its own institutional support and depends on the foreign ministry of the country which happens to chair the Movement during a given three-year period.

The importance of greatly improved organization of developing countries at the global level has been self-evident for decades. It is essential for achieving their greater cohesion and utilizing more fully the potential of South-South cooperation, and for increasing their collective and national influence and role in the United Nations and on the world scene.

It is also necessary for exercising political and intellectual counterweight vis-à-vis the domineering, well-organized and equipped North.

When chairing the South Commission, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, used to say "Countries and peoples of the South must work together and stand up to be counted!"

He felt that a global organization of the South would help the Third World to stand up, interact, think, work and act together, and play an important role in giving direction to multilateral policies and in shaping global futures.

It can be argued that by not building purposefully their institutional strength in the world arena, the developing countries have in effect disempowered themselves. Still, much can be done today to improve the presence of the Global South on the world scene. Developing countries have the means, resources and brains for this historic undertaking and necessity.

The idea of establishing a global organization of the South is now six decades old. When the matter was raised in the South Commission, Manmohan Singh, member of the Commission and its Secretary-General, felt that this was unrealistic given myriads of obstacles, but concluded "unless someone was to serve it to developing countries on a silver platter".

Accepting the validity of his perceptive observation, one should consider how to provide a "silver platter" that would help leapfrog potential obstacles and opposition to the idea, and revitalize the process of gradually building-up this still-missing, South-South piece of global governance architecture of such great importance.

In the rise of the Global South, a primordial role was played by a few visionary national leaders (Nasser, Nehru, Tito) who contributed to conceptualizing ideas and goals, and then spearheaded the initiative to translate these into practice by launching NAM in 1961 and via NAM paving the way for emergence of G77 in 1964.

Later, such was the case of Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, who sought and got support of 1986 Harare NAM Summit for the establishment of the South Commission, and then convinced Mwalimu Nyerere to accept to be its Chairman.

During his chairing of the South Commission, Mwalimu Nyerere grasped the critical role of organizational support for the Global South and devoted the last decade of his life to this idea, which resulted in establishing the South Centre as an IGO intergovernmental think-tank of the Global South.

This was a major breakthrough, but only a first step which did not match the modest "South Secretariat", a medium sized (35 professionals) multifunctional set-up recommended by the South Commission in its report 1990 "The Challenge to the South".

At the 2000 South Summit in Havana, a group of developing countries' leaders headed by President Obasanjo of Nigeria, then chair of G77, launched the initiative to upgrade the institutional machinery of the Global South by "taking over" the South Centre and transforming it into a "coordinating commission" for improving implementation and follow-up of agreed policies and decisions of the Summit.

However, since it was poorly conceived, covertly prepared without any consultation with those concerned, and foisted on the Summit at the last minute, the idea was opposed by many countries and did not get off the ground.

The next upcoming South Summit, on hold due to covid19, offers an opportunity to launch a thorough preparatory, coordination and consultation process required for establishing an Organization of the Global South. Drawing on the rich experiences accumulated, and lessons learned, it could agree on a project and a facility for such an organization.

An innovative institution is needed to serve as the home of the Global South, a nursery of ideas and initiatives of common interest, and a reference point on complex issues on the UN agenda.

For a start, functions of a "South secretariat" recommended in the South Commission's 1990 report "The Challenge to the South", a high-level panel, including some elders who have taken part in earlier endeavours and persons with hands-on-experience of South-South cooperation, can be set up to launch this project of historic importance for the Global South in its efforts to overcome dependence and figure prominently in the changing world geo-political map.

Branislav Gosovic was on the staff of UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), and South Commission. His last post, before retirement, was with the South Centre in Geneva 1991-2006.

Speech by Minister Naledi Pandor on the occasion of the Parliamentary Debate on the Cuban doctors in South Africa

Honourable Speaker and Deputy Speaker,

TD 
	

Honourable Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson,

Honourable Ministers and Deputy Ministers,

Honourable Members,

Colleagues,

Distinguished Guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am pleased to be part of this debate, which reaffirms the moral value of the revolutionary and scientific duty of human solidarity in dealing with the COVID-19 global pandemic.

The Republic of Cuba has been a vital embodiment of humanism and international solidarity since the triumph of the Cuban revolution in 1963. This Cuban solidarity continues a long history of strategic relations between our two nations, inspired by a vision of freedom, anti-racism, anti-apartheid and anti-imperialism.

Madam Speaker, human solidarity in the face of the COVID-19 threat is absolutely necessary for the Global South, where humanity lacks the means to withstand the ravages of this virus and remains vulnerable to a host of other debilitating but preventable conditions.

This solidarity amounts to a moral awakening by the Global South's humanity to the current compromised human condition which has been shaped by an unfair history of socio-economic and racial exploitation, domination and subordination. Leading by example, Cuba is among the nations of the South fully committed to human solidarity.

Cuba has sent over 3 700 healthcare workers to more than 22 countries around the world to lend a helping hand in their hour of need.

South Africa believes that human solidarity can only find expression within the objectives of building a better Africa and a better world. For us building a better world entails an ethical and moral struggle to fight and correct global injustice characterised by structural conditions of under-development that confront the people of the South.

Cuba has led the way in this lofty cause, and its impact has been particularly felt in the health sector where Latin American, Asian and African nations continue to reap the benefits of Cuba's medical diplomacy.

Cuban's leading international health diplomacy is a stark reminder of global inequality and the possibility of re-imagining a better world, if the interests of people are put before profits. By default or otherwise, this humanist vision pricks the conscience of the world through putting international reform of the public health sector to the fore as a matter of human rights.

South Africa and the Republic of Cuba are bonded by a noble history of freedom struggle. The current relations between South Africa and Cuba are morally pedigreed as well as embedded within the doctrine of South-South Relations.

The late great President Mandela acknowledged and extolled the Cuban role in advancing the Agenda of the South during a speech at a banquet in honour of President Fidel Castro of Cuba on the 4 September 1998. On this issue of Cuba, South Africa relations and international solidarity Madiba said.

'The defeat of apartheid demonstrated what can be achieved when we join hands with purpose and conviction. South Africa is committed to working with Cuba to help build a better life for millions of people across both our continents and beyond'.

As Madiba explained our country is committed to working with Cuba for the attainment of a better world. The Cuban medical brigade working with such acclaimed commitment and dedication to save lives in the hinterland of our country do so in pursuit of this exalted vision of building a better human society.

There is no doubt that our strategic relations with Cuba advance the agenda of building a better Africa and a better world and have considerably benefited our country and our people.

Cuba's health international solidarity is epitomised by the Nelson Mandela/Fidel Castro Medical Collaboration.

The NMFC programme was established by presidents Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro in 1996 a bilateral agreement between South Africa and Cuba.

The programme was established to address the over-concentration of health personnel in urban areas and in the exclusionary private sector as well as to increase the number of qualified health professionals.

Honourable Members,

Since the arrival of the more than 200 Cuban doctors to help us fight this pandemic in April 2020 there have been rather unfortunate insinuations, misinformation and distortions pertaining to the conditions of their presence in our country.

Excelling in primary health care and prevention, including preventable diseases, the Cuban health care experience has not only buttressed our health system but made a difference to the lives of our people.

Our country has especially benefited from the Cuban expertise and community orientation, which helped in the area of assessing the underlying factors that lead to diseases in communities.

This has gone a long way towards improving South Africa's primary health care which, the Minister of Health has pointed out, is one of the challenged facts of our health care system.

Under the leadership of President Ramaphosa South Africa has nominated the Henry Reeve International Contingent of Doctors Specialised in Disaster Situations and Serious Epidemics, which is also known as the Cuban Medical Brigade ---- of which there are currently about 3 700 dispatched around the globe in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic --- for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize.

This was a resolution taken by Cabinet, and a move widely supported by an international community that is aware and appreciative of the noble efforts of this group of professionals whose primary aim is to save human life.

This recognition by our government is pursued alongside our immense gratitude to our own healthcare workers.

Our recognition of the Cuban Medical Brigade is part and parcel of the international solidarity and the South-South relations of which South Africa is part. We therefore call on all South Africans to support this nomination for the recognition of the humane agenda driven by the Cuba.

The African continent itself has been among the greatest beneficiaries of Cuban internationalism, not least in the critical sphere of medical assistance.

Few would forget that members of the Cuban leadership travelled to Algiers to build formal relations with the Algerian National Liberation Front, and the fact that Che Guevara's trip around Africa in 1963 was a significant turning point in strengthening Cuba's relationship with liberation movements around the continent.

Building a better Africa and a better world is an imperative of our time for all those concerned with global inequality and the vulnerable conditions of the developing world to poverty, communicable diseases and pandemics such as the COVID-19.

The contribution of Cuba to the Global South and indeed some parts of the Global North in this titanic battle has been nothing short of noble but also a revelation.

Madam Speaker,

Cuba's selfless pursuit of international solidarity as evidenced by both its support for Africa's liberation struggle and medical assistance to the developing world represents counter-narrative to the current dominant mode of discourse which seeks to disguise Western interests as the 'norm' for international relations.

For this moral stand Cuba has endured irrational sanctions and trade embargo. Its international solidarity has been re-narrativised in negative terms to undermine the humanist impulses that drive its foreign policy orientation.

On moments like this one cannot help recalling the towering words of the late President Mandela on the occasion of his visit to Cuba, which echoed moral rectitude that he epitomised. Among others, President Mandela said:

'We have come here today recognizing our great debt to the Cuban people. What other country has such a history of selfless behaviour as Cuba has shown for the people of Africa? How many countries benefit from Cuban health care professionals and educators? How many of these volunteers are now in Africa? What country has ever needed help from Cuba and has not received it? How many countries threatened by imperialism or fighting for their freedom have been able to count on the support of Cuba?'

We look forward to the continued selfless contribution of the Cuban people to our country.

I thank you.

On the 12th of February 2020, the President of the 24th General Assembly of the United Nations, our own Tijjani Mohammed-Bande, convened one of the most crucial Interactive Dialogues of his presidency of the General Assembly. The dialogue was to focus on how to make farming economically more attractive and socially more rewarding career in developing countries. It will also explore which policy measures can best support small holders and family farmers among many other pertinent questions affecting agriculture in the global south. It suffices to say, I was greatly excited when I received an approval from the United Nations to attend the Interactive dialogue, which was on Targeting Hunger: South-South And Triangular Cooperation For Transforming Agriculture

TD 
	

Since the start of my work as an innovator and entrepreneur working in agriculture, I have been fixated on the subject of South-South Cooperation especially with regards to leveraging on solutions and innovations among the countries of the Global South. I have always harboured thoughts around the global South's shared history and similar challenges and the nature of solutions that will bring about meaningful development to the countries and in fact contribute to global development. I was interested in participating in the dialogue on Targeting Hunger because I have always wanted an opportunity to share my experiences, ideas and skills gathered around agriculture, smallholders and the use of simple, disruptive technologies to solve hunger and improve livelihoods at a stage like the United Nations and a platform such as the South-South and Triangular cooperation secretariat.

Earlier on, I was brought much closer to the phenomenal work of the South-South and Triangular Cooperation by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) which is headed by another remarkable Nigerian, Dr. Yemi Akinbamijo, when he paid a visit to my offices in Abuja in 2017. I learned how the South-South Cooperation has undergone various changes particularly given the changes in the international system in the early 21st century, such as the deepening of globalisation, the financial crisis, the decline in foreign aid from traditional donors and the rise of emerging state and non-state players or actors.

Through Dr. Yemi Akinbamijo's FARA, I discovered that among the objectives of the South-South Cooperation is strengthening the capacity of developing countries to identify and jointly analyse their main development issues and develop strategies to address them. Another objective is promoting and strengthening collective self-reliance among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and thirdly, increasing the quantity and improving the quality of cooperation for international development.

With all this at the back of my mind, I settled in for the dialogue at the UN Headquarters, which began with an opening speech from the President of the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, followed by the remarks of Mr. Qu Dongyu, Director-General, Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and Mr. Jorge Chediek, Director, UN Office for South-South Cooperation and Envoy of the Secretary-General on South-South Cooperation. They all stressed on the rising of global hunger for the 4th consecutive year and the genesis of hunger in extreme poverty, which is reflected in the data on poverty from Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

They spoke about the key role of the South-South and Triangular Cooperation in agriculture to address the intertwined issues of poverty and hunger especially in these two of the world's most impoverished and populous regions; Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. They pointed to the essential steps in overcoming hunger in a sustainable manner and how the South-South Cooperation's role in Agriculture can galvanize economic activity, create employment, improve incomes, spur innovation and stimulate self-reliance and entrepreneurship in developing countries

I listened with keen interest especially as the panel discussion on evidence-based policy making for sustainable agriculture and food systems to combat hunger began. My keen interest was even deepened by one of the panelists, who I have great respect for, Mr. Khalid Bomba, CEO of the Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency. His accounts of the Ethiopian agency's strides were insightful and demonstrated the viability of using well-coordinated, sustainable agriculture as a lever to fight poverty, hunger and illiteracy. This agency under the leadership of Mr. Bomba supercharged agricultural development and sustainability in Ethiopia. Other panelists from Indonesia and Ghana all made valuable contributions moderated by Ms. Christine Negra, Special Adviser to UN Foundation.

As I connected the dots between the learning in these various countries and Nigeria, I listened on as the next panel on the role of South-South and Triangular Cooperation in facilitating knowledge-sharing and knowledge-building and leveraging investments in agriculture and food systems to combat hunger headlined by Mr. Jeffrey Sachs, Director, UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

However, even as the dialogue drew to a close with people from various agencies, institutions and countries interacting and sharing experiences and learning, one thought clung to my mind from one of Mr. Khalid Bomba's expositions. He had discovered, through his role at the Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency, "that what holds back progress is often not a lack of knowledge regarding what needs to be done; rather, it is that we fail to make the long-term investments in the systems and institutions necessary to actually get things done".

Professor Herman Wasserman, from the Centre for Film and Media Studies, has been named as the recipient of the 2020 University of Cape Town (UCT) Book Award for his second monograph: Media, Geopolitics and Power: A view from the Global South. His third monograph, The Ethics of Engagement: Media, conflict and democracy in Africa, was recently published.

The purpose of the UCT Book Award is to recognise outstanding and/or influential books written by UCT staff members. It can be awarded to single- or multiple-author books, academic books or fiction, and in electronic or printed format. There are no restrictions on language or codes, and while an award is usually bestowed annually, no award is made if the nominations are not of sufficient merit.

TD 
	

"The book is an attempt to contribute to the field of global media studies."

The book is an overview of Wasserman's research spanning more than a decade, until 2017. His work during this time focused largely on the globalisation of media and the impact of changing geopolitical relations from the vantage point of Africa and, more broadly, the Global South.

It examines questions around issues such as the global phenomenon of tabloidisation of the news and how this manifests in the South African context; the influence of China on African media; the impact of South Africa's BRICS membership on our media; the dominance of the Global North in academic research and how this has shaped the field of media studies; and how voices from the Global South should be better heard in international scholarship.

"The book is [not only] an attempt to contribute to the field of global media studies by ... providing examples and case studies from Africa, but also to interrogate the very assumptions upon which global media studies are based, and the power relations that shape our discipline," said Wasserman.

Wasserman is grateful for the recognition from his peers at UCT, which he appreciates "very much".

"I realise how many outstanding colleagues at UCT do important work, and it's an honour to be counted among the previous recipients of this award," he said.

Meritorious Book Prize

The UCT Book Award, which carries a purse of R30 000, is usually awarded alongside Meritorious Book Prizes of up to R15 000 in value. These are awarded for books in specialised fields that merit recognition for their contribution and/or are awarded to celebrate promising first-time books by authors who deserve special recognition and support. Like the UCT Book Award, the prizes are awarded to UCT staff members; books written in the past five years are eligible.

This year, one Meritorious Book Prize was awarded to lecturer and PhD candidate Kharnita Mohamed from the Department of Anthropology for her book, Called to Song. It is Mohamed's debut novel and follows Qabila - a black, Muslim, middle-class academic in post-apartheid South Africa - as she struggles her way towards a flourishing life.

The book is written from a black feminist perspective and grapples with how our violent histories of racism, sexism and heterosexism influence intimacy, gender relations and racist dis/continuities.

Called to Song was longlisted for the 2019 Sunday Times Barry Ronge Fiction Prize and has been shortlisted for the 2020 National Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences Awards in the fiction category.

HD 	The Scarcity and Expense of Covid-19 Vaccines

Fatima Hassan, founder of the non-governmental organisation sounding the alarm bells over vaccine procurement issues, speaks about pricing, transparency and rollout strategies.

At last, a million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca arrived in South Africa on 1 February 2021. These first doses were manufactured by the Serum Institute of India through a sublicensing agreement. The doses will be held in cold storage and tested before they are given to healthcare workers on the frontline of the pandemic.

TD 
	

In the past few months the government has made a strenuous effort to procure the first batch of Covid-19 vaccines. Fatima Hassan is the head and founder of the rights protection group the Health Justice Initiative. She discusses the government's rollout strategy, the lack of transparency, vaccine scarcity and how this affects the Global South, pricing and profit margins, and how rights groups warned the government about potential supply problems.

Tebadi Mmotla (TM): What is your take on the government's rollout strategy for the first of the Covid-19 vaccines?

Fatima Hassan (FH): The little ... we know ... is that the first batch of vaccines are for healthcare workers ... But when you speak to doctors and other workers on the frontline in healthcare, I think the one part that is confusing is whether [the government is] going to administer the 1.5 million doses first [500 000 of which will be received later this month] and then wait for supplies for the second dose or whether [they are] going to do this as a two-dose batch for up to 750 000 workers. [To be effective, two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine must be administered.]

There's also some concerns about whether the number of healthcare workers and workers in healthcare settings across public and private sectors have been accurately collated. In the next week, you will see a lot of issues emerging potentially around the vaccines actually being administered in multiple parts of the country simultaneously, because the idea - from what we've been told by government and the private sector who are involved in this acquisition - is that all healthcare workers will be able to get the vaccine at the same time.

There's also issues around each different vaccine that may be approved here having different efficacy levels. Obviously, it's like a moving set of goalposts because, while vaccines are being administered, there's also new results and data coming in. And we also have a new variant in South Africa [and] in the United Kingdom ... There's still a lot that I think clinicians and doctors are really urgently looking at and working on.

It's important for our frontline to be protected. And we have to hope that the first phase goes off in a way [that] really prioritises the principle of equity ... All healthcare workers - whether in the public or private sector, in hospitals [or] clinics - that are providing health services and ... doing all this important work [at] this time. [They should all] be able to get vaccinated.

TM: Is the government doing enough to address the issue of vaccine scarcity?

FH: I think the issue of scarcity is a bit more complex because scarcity is also self-created by the global pharmaceutical industry, because they are refusing, in many cases, to share the vaccine know-how and technology. So scarcity and limited supplies became an issue for the European Union [EU] now in the last week to the point where the EU ... just passed a ban on exports of supplies to certain countries. Some countries are exempt.

So scarcity is now an issue that is gripping ... the entire world. And that's because of what happened in the last few months, even though places like the EU had signed these advance market commitments (AMCs) and were guaranteed a certain initial amount of base volumes of dosages, they have not yet received all of it. And they are asking like, 'Why? What's going on?' And part of the reason for that is ... [companies] thought that they ... alone [were] going to meet all of the demand and [so they did] not sublicense other companies [to help manage the load and] scale up the manufacturing for them and for [other companies]. That is now the situation ...

And so it's a real reckoning moment, and it is what we've been saying for months. If you don't share the technology and the vaccine know-how, then nobody else can help you to make it. [When] you ... rely on one or two suppliers ... you will have limited supplies and scarcity ... [which] means that it takes you longer to vaccinate the whole world. That's when you then also have to deal with variants and mutations. The longer it takes to scale up manufacturing by multiple suppliers, [the more intractable] this problem [becomes].

The EU has now realised that they have to address scarcity, because they have certain agreements. They've published a redacted version of the AstraZeneca contract with the EU. It also maybe puts things [into] perspective ... [for] why [in] some middle-income [and] low-income countries, AstraZeneca through Oxford University too, has segmented the global market. They were supposed to supply Europe and the United States of America - ... and other rich nations - and have Serum [Institute of India]... supply the Global South. They have given this one licence to Serum, [and there] may be one other licence [available].

But ... there is no transparency. You don't really know what the terms and conditions are.

TM: Does the lack of transparency leave room for people to feel hesitant about taking the Covid-19 vaccine?

FH: Yes. In any part of the world, [when] a government or those responsible for researching, acquiring or distributing vaccines are [not] transparent [in] sharing information, that's when it's fertile ground for disinformation and conspiracy theories.

So should the South African government do more right now? Yes. It can actually start asserting its authority and consider using state licensing measures. We now have results from Johnson & Johnson [an American multinational corporation involved in vaccine development], and some of the results from the Novavax [an American vaccine development company] trial too.

So you're in a much different situation than you were in December 2020. ... Now you can also see that there are major supply bottlenecks in the rest of the world as well. That means it's going to potentially take longer for those supplies that were ... promised to us to come here. So what do you do? What measures can you take to ramp up manufacturing, to demand scale-up of supplies for the whole of Africa and the rest of the Global South? Because even if we got 40 million [full vaccine doses] tomorrow and you vaccinated everyone that needs to be vaccinated [to achieve population immunity], you are [on] a continent where [there is little] coverage.

Covax is saying we can only maybe help up to 27% of people in low-income countries. They're [talking] about Africa, right?

Yes, governments all around the world have to do more. Last week, we saw the EU, which was very surprising, really taking on the pharmaceutical industry in such a public way [and], in some cases, a punitive way. That may be [showing] other governments in the Global South [that], well, if the EU can take on AstraZeneca and others in this way, then why are we so scared of taking on AstraZeneca, Pfizer [an American pharmaceutical corporation] or Johnson & Johnson?

The other thing linked to supply is that in South Africa you can't supply something that's a vaccine unless it is registered for you. You have to ... give your data to the regulator. So just because somebody wants to sell me a vaccine from Russia or China, I can't buy it or procure it unless ... the data [is] confirmed to be safe and effective. If the Chinese are refusing to share the data, or if Moderna [an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company] is refusing to submit its dossier, then what do you do then? You have an international crisis moment.

Why are companies picking and choosing where they want to go in a pandemic? They should go everywhere. Everybody should share the technology.

The question about the government is why is the procurement - which is such a multisectoral, complex thing residually, you know, the negotiations, the dealings which also include vested political interests and powers - why is it still residing in the Department of Health? It is not just [a] Department of Health issue. Yes, they have a vaccine acquisition task team with the private sector for medical schemes, business, National Treasury representatives, etc. But ... I think it's shortsighted on government support that this is still being driven and located in the Department of Health. They should be giving medical and clinical advice around what they need [and] why they need it.

TM: Pricing has become an important issue for the Covid-19 vaccine. Why is it that countries like South Africa are paying more than other nations?

FH: We don't know a lot. What we do know is ... based on a mistaken tweet by a Belgian minister [about] the EU prices. The EU [has] not confirmed all of its prices either, nor have the other ones.

It's all speculation because there's no price transparency. Covax has not told us what its prices are. So we know that something is wrong, but we don't know the extent because nobody will share the data.

The first problem is that we don't know what the real no-profit prices are. We also don't know what the markups are for the delivery - or are we being charged a premium because of this weird theory that we were not part of the research and development, yet we were part of a clinical trial?

That's what happens normally with the industry, because there's never been price transparency in the pharmaceutical industry and our medicine system in South Africa especially. And in South Africa, we've always had two different prices for the same medicine, the public- and the private-sector price. And there's very little price transparency and scrutiny. We don't even have a global benchmarking system. And so the concern is that we now sign a contract with Covax, which is an unelected structure [and thus does not serve the South African population but rather benefits the supply company]. I have nothing to do with it as a South African citizen. So how do I hold [both the supply company and the South African government] to account for its three different price systems? But my money goes into it, and your money too.

TM: What has been the role of non-governmental organisations throughout the vaccine procurement process, especially your organisation, the Health Justice Initiative?

FH: We have been raising the alarm bells for a very long period ... For four months, we've been warning that we needed more time and more planning around the fact that you're likely to have a global supply problem. And that you are likely not to have cooperation from the pharmaceutical industry.

My organisation already from October and November 2020 had been raising this explicitly and also started engaging in correspondence with the department, and in the different ministries, [which] did not respond... until the reports emerged then indicating that we [were] threatening litigation. So we are still engaged in that process because we don't believe that there's been sufficient sharing of information and transparency around various aspects of the plan. Just yesterday our legal representatives sent a detailed letter requesting information.

HD 	UCT's Herman Wasserman Leads Global Study On Disinformation

Professor Herman Wasserman from the University of Cape Town's (UCT) Centre for Film and Media Studies (CFMS) will embark on an international study on the information disorder in the Global South, with funds of approximately R4.5 million from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC).

The scoping study aims to map the actors currently working in the counter-disinformation space and identify current frameworks upon which interventions are based; to learn from current approaches, tools and methods of countering disinformation; and to gain an overview of the research landscape and identify key issues and questions for further research.

TD 
	

Having worked on the topic of disinformation for a while, Professor Wasserman was invited by the IDRC to apply for a grant to do a scoping study on the information disorder in the Global South. The grant was awarded in January 2021, and work on the project begins immediately and will conclude in December this year.

Wasserman's task as principal investigator is to coordinate the project and oversee data gathering and analysis of the findings. The study will follow a collaborative, participatory approach, which will draw on the expertise of leading researchers and organisations in four sub-regions of the Global South: Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa.

"The input of stakeholders in these regions will be crucial to the project, as they will provide the local expertise and insights drawing on their work in the area of misinformation," said Wasserman.

Disinformation, as defined by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, is information that is false and deliberately created to harm a person, social group, organisation or country. This differs from misinformation, which is false but not created with the intention of causing harm. Dis- and misinformation also refer to a wider range of false and misleading information, conspiracy theories and problems of accessing authoritative and trustworthy news.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) uses the word "infodemic" to refer to an overabundance of information, including deliberate attempts to disseminate incorrect information to undermine the public health response and advance alternative agendas of groups or individuals.

Wasserman explained that despite disinformation being a widespread problem in countries in the Global South, the study thereof remains dominated by examples, case studies and models from the Global North.

"Currently, knowledge about the various manifestations of disinformation, the range of responses and success rate of interventions to counter disinformation remains fragmented and partial," he said.

Thus, to gain a better understanding of the knowledge gaps and areas where further research is required, as well as to identify opportunities for inter- and intraregional cooperation, a scoping study of counter-disinformation efforts in the Global South, such as this one, is needed.

"Globally, we can see a growing 'information disorder': the large-scale contamination of the public sphere with rumour, hate speech, dangerous and unfounded conspiracy theories, harmful misunderstandings, and orchestrated campaigns of deception," said Wasserman.

Disinformation campaigns predate the pandemic. In South Africa there was the white monopoly capital campaign run by supporters of former president Jacob Zuma, with the help of British-based public relations firm Bell Pottinger. Another damaging example is the xenophobic Twitter campaign led by the fabricated handle @uLerato_pillay. In Global South countries such as Nigeria, Kenya and India, disinformation campaigns have also threatened to derail elections.

"The rising tide of disinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine is also a very worrying development."

These speak to Wasserman's explanation of disinformation campaigns as often drawing on continued social polarisation, ethnic tensions and economic inequality in postcolonial contexts. And social media has emerged as a breeding ground for racism, xenophobia and misogyny.

The urgency to understand and research mis- and disinformation has been renewed by the COVID-19 pandemic, evident in conspiracy theories and rumours, such as miracle cures in Tanzania and Madagascar. This has added to the infodemic of mis- and disinformation around the virus.

"The rising tide of disinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine is also a very worrying development," Wasserman added.

Wasserman pointed out that this "contamination of the online public sphere" has happened in parallel with a financial and political crisis for traditional, quality and fact-checked news sources.

"The sustainability of ethical, independent and trustworthy news media is especially important in the Global South as a bulwark against state propaganda and attempts by authoritarian states to obstruct the free flow of information and critical journalism," he said.

The pandemic has further eroded the revenue base of news outlets around the world, many of whom were already struggling with a collapse in advertising markets and a sluggish response to the challenges brought on by internet media. The effects of the pandemic include job losses and closures of news outlets, including many independent and community newspapers in regions in the Global South.

Wasserman added that along with these economic pressures, there is also a resurgence of censorship, control and repressive tactics by a range of political actors.

"The result is a deluge of data and content online, and a dearth of quality, verifiable information that makes it increasingly difficult for citizens to discern facts from fantasies," he said.

During the pandemic, this has led some countries in the Global South, such as South Africa and Brazil, to criminalise disinformation about COVID-19 to protect citizens from harmful information circulating on social media; however, these attempts have raised concerns that governments might use the pandemic as a smokescreen to stifle free expression and avoid political accountability.

"In other words, the 'information disorder' is a global problem, but has specific characteristics in the Global South, which remains under-researched."

HD 	Covid-19 Further Exposes Inequalities in the Global Financial System

To stem the economic fallout from COVID-19, developed countries have injected an unprecedented US$9 trillion into their economies.

The International Monetary Fund has recommended sustained fiscal support, emphasizing greater spending on health care and environmental protection projects.

TD 
	

Meanwhile, countries in the "global south" - broadly, low- and middle-income countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa - face more dire circumstances. They don't have the ability to inject that level of cash into their economies.

And it's not only because their economies are poorer.

As an economics professor, I focus on the systemic inequalities in the global financial system that block such access in developing economies.

With a greater public awareness of soaring inequality within countries, it is also important to recognize the deep imbalances across the global financial system.

Fiscal support in developed economies is often financed by deficit spending and government borrowing. Countries like the United States finance a major part of deficits by borrowing from companies and central banks within their own countries. Such borrowing remains in the countries' own currency, making them less risky.

The fiscal deficit in advanced economies - a group of 39 nations including the U.S., European countries and Japan - is projected to expand to 14.4% in 2020 from 3.3% in 2019, according to the IMF.

This deficit financing is practically inaccessible to developing economies, given the extreme inequalities in global wealth. These nations secure most of their deficit financing through lending from multilateral agencies like the International Monetary Fund. Or they borrow dollars in international capital markets. They then have to pay back the debt in dollars, which makes the loans more expensive if the value of their own currency drops.

During the 2008 financial crisis, the limited availability of multilateral lending forced low-income countries - particularly in Africa - to fund recovery efforts and infrastructure expansion by borrowing dollars in private markets.

Caribbean nations also relied on private loans to recover from the financial crisis and multiple hurricanes.

To reimburse these loans, low-income countries depend on money they make from the exportation of raw materials, or commodities, and tourism, which are paid in U.S. dollars.

Dependence on the sale of commodities, an outcome of trade patterns established by the European colonization of the global south in the 19th century, is often associated with economic instability.

The 2014 crash in commodities prices, for example, caused big declines in dollar earnings in the global south. It also led to a fall in the currency values of commodities exporters.

Consequently, interest payments and the value of dollar-denominated debt increased in countries like Ghana and Mozambique. The commodities crash also increased debt burdens in such countries as Brazil and Mexico. Facing a sudden devaluation of their currencies and lower export earnings, many countries had to borrow more to continue to service previous loans.

Payments on external debt as a percentage of government revenues also ballooned.

Though low-income economies borrow less compared with their GDPs - an estimate of the value of the goods produced by their economies - payment burdens are greater because most payments are external and have to be made in dollars.

Ghana's debt-to-GDP ratio in 2018, for example, was 59.3% compared with 90.5% for the United States. As a group, the debt-to-GDP ratio in low-income economies - usually defined as countries with per capita income of less than $1,000 - averaged about 20%, according to the IMF. That compares with 105% in advanced economies. These numbers contradict the view that low-income countries tend to overborrow.

Yet because of exchange rate risks and dollar payments, Ghana's ratio of external payments to revenue, for example, rose from 10% in 2014 to 40% in 2018.

These rising ratios also led to downgrades in credit ratings by private rating agencies and classifications of high risk status by the IMF's Debt Sustainability Framework.

Critics have denounced the Debt Sustainability Framework for focusing on payment capacity and viewing all debt equally. They say that the IMF should distinguish between debt that is wasteful, such as recurring administrative expenses, and debt that funds crucial infrastructure, health and climate crisis projects.

[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter.]

Meanwhile, ratings downgrades led to higher costs for the new loans, as lenders sought higher rates to mitigate greater perceived risk.

This, in turn, set off a new cycle of higher debt burdens.

Amid COVID-19, key dollar-earning sectors in developing countries - tourism, commodities exports and remittances - are projected to take deep hits. Group of 30, a research forum of prominent economists, expects a $150 billion decline for low-income countries.

This has set off another wave of credit rating downgrades that will make borrowing prohibitively expensive.

The African Peer Review Mechanism, a panel set up by the African Union, recently protested these downgrades for blocking efforts to mobilize fiscal resources amid the pandemic.

In Morocco, for example, the credit rating downgrade may force the government to scrap plans to expand health care spending during the pandemic.

So while advanced countries have spent about 8% of GDP on recovery efforts in 2020, low-income countries have managed an average of 1.4% of GDP. And only 0.6% of GDP has been spent in the health sector, according to the IMF.

Amid the pandemic, some economists have called for debt relief and an expanded allocation of the IMF's global reserve currency unit, known as Special Drawing Rights.

Proposed expansions of Special Drawing Rights would be allocated to each member country of the IMF. That would allow increased access to a global currency unit and therefore reduce the need for dollar earnings.

I believe such measures are a necessary corrective to the disparate burdens and systemic inequalities in the global financial system.

HD 	End Abusive Sex Testing for Women Athletes - Tests Violate Rights, Ruin Lives

Women track and field athletes, largely from the Global South, are abused and harmed by "sex testing" regulations, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The regulations target women in running events between 400 meters and one mile, and compel women they target to undergo medical interventions or be forced out of competition.

TD 
	

The 120-page report, "'They're Chasing Us Away from Sport': Human Rights Violations in Sex Testing of Elite Women Athletes," documents the experiences of more than a dozen women athletes from the Global South who have been affected by sex testing regulations. Human Rights watch found that global regulations that encourage discrimination, surveillance, and coerced medical intervention on women athletes result in physical and psychological injury and economic hardship. The International Olympic Committee -- the supreme body in global sports -- is developing guidelines to address human rights violations caused by sex testing policies.

"World Athletics has targeted women from the Global South for decades, treating those with high testosterone as less than human," said Payoshni Mitra, scholar and athlete rights advocate. "These regulations demean women, make them feel inadequate, and coerce them into medical interventions for participation in sports. Modern sport should adapt itself to support inclusion and non-discrimination rather than perpetuate exclusion and discrimination."

Human Rights Watch partnered with expert scholars Payoshni Mitra and Katrina Karkazis to conduct research in 2019, interviewing affected athletes, coaches, and other officials and experts relevant to this issue, as well as reviewing court and medical documents.

For decades, sport governing bodies have regulated women's participation in sport through "sex testing" regulations that target women athletes with some variations in their sex characteristics that cause their natural testosterone levels to be higher than typical. The regulations deny these women the right to participate as women for running events between 400 meters and one mile, unless they submit to invasive testing and medically unnecessary procedures. These practices violate fundamental rights to privacy, health, and non-discrimination. Women from the Global South -- including runners such as Dutee Chand from India and Caster Semenya from South Africa -- have been disproportionately harmed.

To identify those covered by the regulations, officials subject all women athletes' bodies to public scrutiny and require those who seem "suspect" to undergo degrading and often invasive medical examinations. They amount to policing women's bodies based on arbitrary definitions of femininity and racial stereotypes. There is no scientific consensus that women with naturally higher testosterone have a performance advantage in athletics. Despite a wide range of testosterone levels among men, there have never been analogous regulations.

Women interviewed described intense self-questioning, shame, and withdrawal from sport -- even when it was their livelihood -- and suicide attempts. A runner who had been sex tested and subsequently disqualified said: "I wanted to know the results.... I wanted to know who am I? Why are they testing me? They're not testing other girls.... I wanted to know why they have taken me to the hospital, removing the clothes."

In addition to the human rights violations inherent in the regulations, the impact of their enforcement extends beyond sport. Success in athletics can deliver economic stability for women. From scholarships to housing and food, the benefits can come early and may also lead to stable employment outside of sport. Many athletes interviewed grew up in abject poverty. Their success in athletics often became a source of livelihood for their extended families. In some cases, their abrupt departure from sport after being disqualified devastated their and their families' economic well-being.

Health experts, human rights advocates, and elite athletes have increasingly spoken out against the regulations. In a 2020 report, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recommended immediately revoking sex testing regulations for women athletes. The World Medical Association has recommended that physicians around the world should not observe the regulations as they violate medical ethics.

In 2019, 25 French women athletes wrote an open letter to World Athletics president Sebastian Coe, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach, and health and sports ministers around the world, saying, "These women are human beings and high-level athletes like us. We share with them the same passion for sport and its values. Their health and their future are in danger. The image of the sport is once again dirty. Human rights and human dignity are flouted."

Roxana Maracineanu, France's minister of sports, reacted saying, "we have women who compete who are stronger than other women, we have men who compete who are stronger than other men, it is the principle of sport and the best wins. I do not understand from a sporting point of view, why in categories of men, men like Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, Ian Thorpe and others have the opportunity to dominate their category, and why in a women's category, women do not have the right to dominate in their category."

"Animated by erroneous beliefs about testosterone, biology, and gender, and steeped in paternalistic language around 'protecting' women athletes, these regulations do untold harm to women, especially from the Global South," said Katrina Karkazis, visiting professor of women's, gender and sexuality studies at Emory University, and fellow at Yale Global Health Justice Initiative. "These regulations are damaging because the underlying assumptions are inherently sexist -- that women athletes are always inferior to men athletes, so we must police women's sports in order to protect women. This policing does nothing to protect women; it only serves to harm them."

The global sporting industry is regulated by a complex system of local, national, regional, and international governmental and nongovernmental entities -- including sport governing bodies -- that have different relationships with official human rights mechanisms. Sport governing bodies have a particular role in regulating sport around the world.

Governments across the world have committed to gender equality and non-discrimination against women. Governments are obligated to protect the rights of athletes representing their countries and competing on their soil. Human rights standards apply to all. Policies that are inherently discriminatory -- such as sex testing regulations -- fly in the face of the Olympic movement's commitments to dignity and equality for all, Human Rights Watch said. Regulating fair play is a valid undertaking for sport authorities; committing human rights violations in the process is not.

World Athletics should immediately rescind the regulations. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) -- the supreme authority in international sports -- should uphold the fundamental principles of the Olympic Charter, including Principle 4, which states that "every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind," and Principle 6, which states that "The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Olympic Charter shall be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."

The IOC should publicly acknowledge the racial and gender biases in sex testing regulations, and remove all regulations that require medically unnecessary intervention for continuing eligibility.

"In scrutinizing and excluding women competitors based on their natural hormone levels, the World Athletics regulations stigmatize, stereotype, and discriminate against all women," said Agnes Odhiambo, senior women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Being compelled to undergo a medical examination can be humiliating as it is medically unnecessary. Identifying athletes through observation and suspicion amounts to a policing of women's bodies based on arbitrary definitions of femininity and racial stereotypes."

HD 	Youth Urge World Leaders to Adopt Climate Treaty

At least 300 youths drawn from 140 countries, including from Africa, have penned an open letter calling on world leaders to implement a set of realistic, progressive, youth-centered climate policies.

Delegates at MockCOP26, an international youth-led climate conference, have since presented the Treaty to Nigel Topping, the High Level Climate Action Champion for COP26, urging national governments around the World to raise ambition and action in the run up to COP26.

TD 
	

In a press statement, youths said the policy recommendations, developed over the past two weeks of negotiations, cover six themes: climate education, climate justice, health and wellbeing, climate resilient communities, national carbon reduction targets and protecting biodiversity.

Youths are calling for governments' commitment to limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, ban offshoring of emissions, adoption of strong regulation on air quality, and promote significant emission reduction.

"In the Treaty, Mock COP26 delegates are calling on governments to include policy measures to assist farmers to move away from practices that are harmful to soils, water and biodiversity and that fuel deforestation. Delegates also called for a far-reaching law on ecocide to criminalize the mass destruction and damage of the environment by human activity.

"The Treaty includes an ask for national governments to ensure that substantive education on climate change is available to young people at every level of formal education, based on the best available science.

"In addition to this, delegates are calling on countries to protect the rights of young climate activists and include young people in decision-making matters relating to the climate emergency and ecological crisis, including sending more youth representatives to COP26," reads part of the statement.

James Thornton, chief executive officer and founder of ClientEarth, one of the lead organizers of the MockCOP26 said the powerful statement by youth calls for protection of the environment for future generations.

"The youth behind Mock COP26 have created a powerful statement calling on governments to take action to protect future generations from the worst impacts of climate change. Decisions taken by governments now will affect the youngest generation for many years to come.

"Now is the time to listen to young people and implement their urgent demands," says Thornton.

Rufaro Matsika climate researcher with Advocates for Earth-a non-profit, public interest environmental law, climate and wildlife justice organization for the Global South, represented the voice of Africa.

Matsika said their input related to transfer of wealth for the Global South to extricate herself from the climate crisis, where impact of climate change is disproportionate, despite minimal contributions to causes.

"As a Youth from the Global South, attending the MockCop offered a great opportunity to raise Climate change issues in Zimbabwe and global south and be able to negotiate on policies we need to be crafted in order to achieve Climate Justice and a Just Transition.

"The main concern we had as global south countries were issues pertaining to climate justice where we emphasized the need for transfer of wealth from Global North countries mostly responsible for the climate crisis to the Global south who are least responsible and mostly vulnerable and have little capacity to adapt.

"In as much as we want to move away from fossil fuels we cannot afford to make the abrupt transition without financial assistance, we were there as Zimbabwean delegates raising our voices so that global leaders can hear our plea," she said.

Youths also negotiated on the need to streamline Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) plans to spell out specific country actions on interim targets, carbon trading, GHG inventories, carbon sinks, and carbon pricing especially on those highly contributing to GHG emissions.

Mock COP26 is coordinated by a group of young climate activists from across the globe, mostly from the Fridays for the Future International Committee, united in their frustration at the speed of progress from world leaders on combating climate change and its effects.

HD 	U.S. Elections Expose Flaws in Western Democracy

Americans love to promote the myth that they have the corner on government by and for the people, but the latest brouhaha at the polls suggests otherwise.

Despite the cheers ringing around the world, the democracy that insists it is better than the rest has just reminded us how deeply flawed it is.

TD 
	

After it became clear that Joe Biden had won the United States election, he and Democratic Party leaders told the world that American democracy had again triumphed. If Biden does take office - which is not certain since Donald Trump may find a way to deny him - it is only a matter of time before the American government, its academics and its democracy-promotion industry will again be telling the rest of us whether we are democratic enough.

This despite the fact that the US's own election looked uncannily like one of those in Africa, Asia or Latin America, which the US democracy establishment loves to judge.

We know what US democracy promoters would say about an election with these features: an incumbent refuses to go despite having lost and claims fraud without evidence; there are fears that judges appointed by the incumbent will overturn the result; shops are boarded up ahead of the poll for fears of violence; gun-toting zealots try to storm election centres to stop the counting of votes for the opposition candidate; unrest hits the streets as supporters and opponents of the incumbent claim their candidate has won. No wonder election monitors used to watching elections elsewhere are now monitoring the US poll.

The parallels with caricature "third-world" elections were not lost on some, including Financial Times Southern Africa correspondent Joseph Cotterill, who suggested on Twitter that, if the US election were happening here, Western diplomats might be saying, "Yeah, that was good enough, don't rock the boat" and would back the incumbent. In the midst of all this, the US embassy in Côte d'Ivoire, with a straight face, issued a statement on that country's disputed elections, urging all parties to find inclusive solutions and resolve election grievances peacefully (in fairness, it did not have the gall to advise anyone to accept the results).

Telling others to do what the US says, not what it does, is not new.

Anyone interested in democracy in the Global South is used to Americans, joined at times by Western Europeans, who "promote democracy" around the world. That really means judging how close others are to an idealised model of democracy in the West. An entire area of study was developed to give this missionary work academic respectability - the "democratic consolidation" framework, which claimed to work out whether a new democracy was "really democratic", which means how closely they were said to resemble North American or Western European democracies.

If we didn't measure up, we would be told what we needed to do to win approval. This view is often embraced by academics and commentators in the Global South: it is common to hear African analysts discussing how our democracies can become "real" like those in the West.

But the "perfect" Western democracies are not at all perfect. Britain, still admired by many in Africa and Asia, has an unelected house of traditional leaders and has allowed police to detain suspected "terrorists" without trial. But few are as imperfect as the United States.

Two core principles of democracy are that all adults are allowed to vote and that each vote counts as much as all the others. Neither applies in the US. "Voter suppression", finding ways to deny the vote to people who are likely to vote for the other party, is common. At the moment, a favoured trick is making sure that voting places are plentiful in areas where people vote the "right" way and very hard to find in places where they don't.

Nor do all votes count equally. In presidential elections, the candidate with the most votes does not necessarily win because the election is decided not on how many votes candidates get but by how many states they win. Biden won the popular vote handily but still had to battle to win the election. In the two national law-making bodies, the Senate and House of Representatives, votes also do not count equally. In the Senate, the millions of voters who live in California, Texas or New York elect two Senators each, while those in tiny states such as Wyoming and Rhode Island also elect two. In the House, boundaries are often drawn to favour the party that controls the state - the term "gerrymandering" was invented in the US to describe drawing boundaries to favour your party. Since control of the Senate entitles parties to choose Supreme Court judges who serve for life and can overturn laws, a minority can not only govern but ensure that the courts override the laws the other side passes if it happens to win.

The much-praised US Constitution was never primarily about protecting human rights - it was about hammering out a deal between states. This is why the presidency is about winning states and why tiny states have as many Senators as huge ones. Most important, it is why states have the power to make their own election rules. What this can mean was best illustrated by the election of Georgia's governor in 2018: the Republican candidate was also in charge of running the election, since he happened to be Georgia's secretary of state (amazingly, he won). While this may be an extreme case, states have plenty of leeway to tilt the table in favour of the party in power.

Inevitably, this has led to all manner of inequities. Democrat John F Kennedy's win in 1960 may have been a product of some irregular help from Democrats in the state of Illinois, and in 2000, the Republican presidential candidate, George Bush the younger, won despite losing the popular vote because he was awarded the state of Florida, where his brother was the governor, and where the voting machines were faulty. (Pause to imagine what the US democracy promotion industry would have said if that had happened in Burundi.) But no one minded much because the country was not as polarised as it is now.

This polarisation is surely a product of a core American divide: race. For much of America's life, white control was unquestioned: Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal coalition, remembered as the high point of progressive US politics, included Southern white supremacists. But the US has become far more diverse, and whites are due to become a minority within 20 years. This is seen as a mortal threat by whites in small towns and rural areas in particular. Since the effect of the rules is to give towns and rural areas far more power than big cities, the system now further fans the flames of division, which is why US elections are coming to look more and more like those in the Global South.

The lesson is surely clear. "Western" democracies are not "the real thing" against which all others should be measured. They are no better than, and may sometimes be worse than, those everywhere else. Nor is democracy a "Western product" - the right to govern ourselves belongs to everyone. The US election reminds us to shed our democratic inferiority complex and to end the myth that democracy is somehow the property of the West.

An annual youth symposium focusing on capturing voice of marginalized youths in the climate change crisis discussions has kicked off in Bulawayo amid calls for the mainstreaming of youth voices in policy formulation.

Hosted annually by Advocates4Earth, the indaba in its third year running, will tackle the impact of the climate crisis on human rights and livelihoods to counter environmental and climate injustice in adaptation policies.

TD 
	

Advocates4Earth founding director Tinashe Chisaira said Zimbabwe faces a challenge of deep-seated inequality emanating from the current neo-liberal and capitalistic economic model in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Chisaira said youths who are often left out in policy formulation will have an opportunity to add their voice in the climate debate and have their concerns captured.

He expressed worry over significant lack of youth participation in analytical policy engagement and advocacy on the issues of climate change, climate adaptation and mitigation as well as human rights and socio-ecological transformation.

"We have a major problem in Zimbabwe which is climate change adaptation. We already know that climate change is here we cannot run away from it but we have to capacitate our people to adapt in the face of climate change be it in terms of agriculture.

"Our main focus is to capture the voice of young people who are often excluded, we have young voices, researchers and civic activists sharing on climate adaptation.

"We will come up with a journal that we will then distribute to policy makers and stakeholders, young voices participating will also be added into this journal," said Chisaira.

Youthful academies researchers, civic activists will submit of draft papers and share findings for validation by delegates and this will to contribute to the final journal which we will launch at the end of this program.

Advocates4Earth says there is significant human rights impacts and lack of adaptation preparedness posed by the economic system in Zimbabwe and the Global South, calls for collaborative actions.

The Global South, faces the worst of climate change impact despite contributing the least to the current negative impacts, while its resources are exploited without consummate benefits to its inhabitants.

Chisaira said the symposium will provide a platform for experience sharing, development of critical analysis of modern environmental and social changes and network building among youths and their allies in the struggle for proper responses to the impacts of climate change.

"The Symposium brings together young people from climate justice organisations, civil society, colleges, political parties and trade unions around Zimbabwe who are passionate about addressing climate change, analyzing the impacts of climate change on human rights and social justice as well as movement building and promoting sustainable lifestyles," he said.

The 1st Annual symposium ran under the theme 'Extractive Industries and Human rights'. The 2nd Annual Symposium was themed 'Sustainability'. The 2020 Edition of the symposium will run under the theme 'Climate change adaptation in the Global South'.

Advocates4Earth is a non-profit, public interest environmental law, climate and wildlife justice organization for the Global South.

HD 	Wheeling and Dealing for a Covid-19 Vaccine

A Covid-19 jab could cost hundreds of rands. Or not. It's anyone's guess. Could another pandemic almost a century ago hold clues for handling the coronavirus today?

Richer countries have already bought more than 4.2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines, before jabs have been shown to work. If you think countries in the Global South aren't playing the game, you'd be wrong, but the odds have never been in their favour.

TD 
	

The town of San Angelo sits where three rivers meet on the Texas prairie in the United States. "A place nature itself set aside as a beacon unto the frontier," a narrator says over footage of a wide, muddy river flanked by wild grassland shrubs. In the video, the local chamber of commerce cheerily describes the city as "a west Texas oasis".

The first cases of the pandemic came in May. Soon, the city banned public gatherings.

"Theatre [signs] went dark in San Angelo Thursday night," a local journalist wrote in the town paper. "There were no youngsters splashing in the municipal pool during the day. No San Angelo churches will meet on Sunday."

A local doctor remarked: "We got to the point no one could comprehend, when people would not even shake hands."

The year was 1949 and the plague was polio, captured in David M Oshinsky's book of the same name. One out of every 124 people in the town would develop symptoms, Oshinsky writes. It was one of the most severe recorded outbreaks at the time. Similar tales played out globally with epidemics that same year in countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada.

"There was no telling who would get it and who would be spared," writes the Pulitzer Prize-winning author. "It killed some of its victims and marked others for life."

Soon, scientists would find themselves racing to invent a vaccine.

Vaccine nationalism, not only for the rich

Today, more than four dozen potential Covid-19 vaccines are in human clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Two are being tested in South Africa. But even before any pharmaceutical companies have proven the effectiveness of these immunisations, rich nations have secured deals with them for future stock.

A recent analysis by essential medicines expert and Oxfam senior policy adviser Mohga Kamal-Yanni found that the US, UK, European Union and Japan have already earmarked what she calls "the lion's share" of vaccines. Some of these vaccines, however, will prove ineffective in clinical trials and never make it to market.

But countries in the Global South haven't stood by helplessly. Indonesia, for instance, struck a pact with drug firm AstraZeneca for 100 million doses. Many more deals are likely ongoing but will not be made public. The Netherlands has declared agreements like these state secrets, Dutch lawyer and activist Ellen 't Hoen recently told the G20 Civil Society Summit.

This kind of vaccine nationalism is nothing new. During the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, high-income countries able to produce vaccines refused to export them until domestic need was met, researchers wrote in The Milbank Quarterly journal in 2019.

R350 for a coronavirus jab?

To help level the playing field, public-private vaccine partnership GAVI launched the Covax initiative. Covax aims to pool nations' purchasing power to secure a minimum number of affordable jabs for all participating countries. There's no way to know the eventual price tag of a coronavirus vaccine, but a current working estimate is around R350 each, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF) senior vaccines policy adviser Kate Elder.

Middle and high-income countries such as South Africa, Namibia and Botswana will pay for stocks procured through Covax. When it launched, the initiative intended to provide impoverished countries with free, donor-funded jabs, but these countries will now pay a subsidised price of up to R67 for a two-dose vaccine.

Richard Mihigo is the programme manager for immunisations and vaccine development at the WHO's Africa office. He says the organisation knows some countries cannot afford even heavily subsidised vaccines and is working with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the African Union to raise the money to help fill this gap. Ultimately, Covax hopes it can guarantee participating countries enough vaccines to immunise 20% of their populations.

The initiative has already penned contracts for hundreds of millions of doses from manufacturers in the Global South, says GAVI managing director Thabani Maphosa. "The upshot of this is a more diverse, more competitive market for vaccines that has been proven to bring down costs dramatically in the long run."

But for decades, the way medicines are developed, priced, patented and made has disadvantaged people in more impoverished countries. It goes beyond the actions of a single drug company and involves a complicated global system of research and development, production and patents.

In May, more than 140 global leaders responded to a call for a "people's vaccine" for Covid-19. The United Nations and other organisations asked that countries and international partners agree to share all knowledge, data and technologies related to the coronavirus with a WHO-led patent pool, which launched just days later. The aim of the pool is to allow countries to license the technology freely.

"The MSF's experience has shown that by holding and enforcing patents on lifesaving vaccines, pharmaceutical corporations maintain overall control of the scale of production, competition, price and supply of their vaccines," the humanitarian organisation wrote in June.

But patents may be only one piece of a complicated puzzle to secure a Covid-19 vaccine for all, and it may not be the world's most immediate problem.

Covax isn't designed to change how the world patents medicine. Instead, it hopes to shape markets. Maphosa says it is not patents but a shortage of supply that is the biggest threat to equitable access to a future vaccine. By 14 October, 82 countries had signed binding contracts to join Covax. Only two African countries, Libya and Mauritius, are among them.

Recently, self-paying countries such as South Africa were expected to make Covax down payments for their vaccines.

Still, the GAVI cannot assure nations how many doses of a vaccine they will get. And making down payments without a guarantee is likely a tough ask for many nations already struggling to fund Covid-19 responses. In June, South Africa's National Treasury rearranged its budget to devote a further R21.5 billion to healthcare amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But it issued a warning, saying "the public finances are dangerously overstretched" and that "a fiscal reckoning looms".

A 'people's vaccine' is born

In western Johannesburg, the sprawling Sizwe Tropical Diseases Hospital rises up from the banks of the city's iconic Jukskei River. Today, the facility serves mainly tuberculosis patients. But almost a century ago, its grounds were home to the national polio research foundation.

In the 1950s, children and an increasing number of adults in their 20s and 30s were still feeling the wrath of polio around the world. Some were doomed to live out their days in the confines of an iron lung. One of these hunkering, full-body, negative-pressure ventilators still stands at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases down the road from the Sizwe hospital.

By 1955, scientist Jonas Salk had emerged the winner in the race to discover the world's first polio vaccine, an endeavour that had been funded mainly by public donations.

The foundation that had bankrolled much of the work and an American university had hoped to patent the new vaccine, Oshinsky writes. He notes that Salk was sceptical and soon after the scientist's discovery was announced, Salk appeared on national television. A show host asked Salk who owned the patent to his new polio vaccine.

"Well, the people, I would say," Salk replied. "There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?"

Without a patent, Salk's vaccine could be produced anywhere in the world by any firm with the means and will. 'T Hoen says: "Indeed [Salk's vaccine] was, and still is, a people's vaccine."

No quick fixes

Covax makes no provision to license future Covid-19 vaccines to new manufacturers to increase supply or reduce the cost. The WHO is hoping companies will voluntarily issue licences for coronavirus drugs, equipment and vaccines, but no pharmaceutical company has yet offered to do so publicly. Meanwhile, many countries cannot produce vaccines locally, says Maphosa.

"It is important that Africa, along with other regions of the Global South, builds its own vaccine manufacturing capacity and ... that leaders from the public and private sector do everything they can to drive forward this goal," he says. "Today, sadly, it is just not realistic to believe that the provision of technological know-how to every country in the world will enable us to produce the amount of doses we need, in the time we need them, to defeat the pandemic."

South Africa launched a private-public partnership to manufacture vaccines in 2003. Almost 20 years later, the institute cannot produce a vaccine from start to finish, says Mihigo, who manages the WHO's immunisation and vaccine development programme in Africa.

"In acknowledgement of the fact that supply constraints, not intellectual property issues, will be the biggest barrier to achieving global coverage of Covid-19 vaccines," Maphosa says, "Covax is instead focusing on raising enough cash to incentivise manufacturers to make enough doses to satisfy global demand."

It's certainly about increasing manufacturing capacity, says Elder. But it is also about reducing intellectual property barriers for any manufacturer that could produce the vaccines. "The two don't have to be mutually exclusive," she says.

But patents alone, 'T Hoen warns, won't solve the dilemma of who gets a vaccine and when: "Breaking the stronghold of intellectual property in the form of patents is only one of the measures that needs to be taken and it will not be enough ... You also need ... access to the knowledge, the data, the material and the technology [to produce them]."

Patents or not, there is ultimately not enough capacity in Africa to produce Covid-19 vaccines and won't be anytime soon, says University of the Witwatersrand professor of vaccinology Shabir Madhi.

"I wish patents were an issue," adds Madhi, who is leading the two Covid-19 vaccine trials in South Africa. "But the reality is that if all the companies [were to] tell South Africa [it had] open access to all the vaccines developed, there simply isn't manufacturing capacity, not only in South Africa but in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa."

Should one of the two coronavirus jabs being tested, the Novavax vaccine, prove to work, South Africa will be prioritised for future jabs - made in India - as part of an agreement between vaccine makers and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Madhi adds.

Meanwhile, he says, Covax may not be perfect but for many of the world's most impoverished countries, it may be their best option at a timely and "reasonably equitable" access to a future coronavirus vaccine.

From polio to HIV

In October, India and South Africa wrote to the World Trade Organization (WTO) asking it to waive aspects of protection for copyrights, patents, trade secrets and product designs for Covid-19 medicines and vaccines for several years. International trade law already allows for this during times of public health emergencies, but the law remains difficult for countries in the Global South to use.

The waiver proposed by South Africa and India would allow nations to, for instance, manufacture or import a patent-protected invention, such as a vaccine, without fear of economic reprisals from countries keen on protecting pharmaceutical interests, South Africa's Health Justice Initiative head Fatima Hassan told the Mail & Guardian newspaper recently. The proposal has been co-sponsored by Kenya and eSwatini, but the WTO has yet to pass it.

Oshinsky writes that in Salk's last years before his death in 1995, the US scientist turned his attention to trying to discover an HIV vaccine. His view on the profitability of an HIV vaccine that never came to be? "This time, however, there was no talk of giving it to the world as a gift - no illusions about patenting the sun," Oshinsky writes.

That unfortunate plot twist in the story of the man behind "the people's vaccine", whose young leftist leanings -- including advocating for socialised medicine as well as racial equality -- were once the focus of a federal investigation, is not often remembered.

HD 	Anxiety in Johannesburg - New Views On a Global South City

Within the media and popular culture of the global north, cities like Johannesburg, South Africa, are often presented as a site of trouble. They're the source of the immigrants, drugs, violence, poverty, disease and environmental crisis that worry nervous citizens of more "developed" cities.

TD 
	

Even when they take centre stage in international media production, global south cities like Johannesburg are laden with fear or fantasy. Think of the films District 9 with its slavering Nigerian gangsters, the homeless genius of Slumdog Millionaire or Roma's contentedly familial domestic worker. In so many instances, these urban spaces - vibrant, changeable, challenging, new - appear as nothing more than locations for the fluffy imaginaries or collective fears of the north.

In his book Liquid Times, the philosopher Zygmunt Bauman calls fear "arguably the most sinister of the demons nesting in the open societies of our time". He writes of fear as a palpable monster that stalks the lives of late modern subjects in a world where the centres of power are diffuse and remote.

Fear is, indeed, one way of describing this condition. But anxiety is perhaps more useful, suggesting a feeling that is persistent, low-level and even, in psychologist Kopano Ratele's term, "objectless". Anxiety is ever-present. It does not depend on particular triggers. It is easily spread and shared, passed around on the wind, like a rumour, like a virus.

Anxiety in Johannesburg is nothing new. Despite its intermittent glamour, the city has always felt unstable for those who live in it. South Africa's largest and wealthiest urban centre, it is also deeply unequal and striated by the spatial markers of apartheid. According to urban planning professor Martin J. Murray, it

leads a double life. The city is a paradigmatic exemplar of first world glamour and excess and third world improvement and degradation. It is simultaneously a global marketplace of speculative investment integrally linked to the world economy via globalising space of flows.

Black migrants who were once forced into urban labour by law now face the same conditions because of poverty, unemployment and rural underdevelopment. Fears of hunger and violence mesh with a neoliberal fear of failure, of being left behind in a rapidly changing world, painfully symbolised by the city's "branded skyline". White suburbanites who once quailed from imaginary communists now invest enthusiastically in security technologies and report passers-by to armed private guards.

In all parts of the city, from malls to taxi ranks to alleys, women worry whether they will make it home safely - or if at home, whether they will make it through the night. From hawkers in the central business district to grifters in the banking malls, nothing seems entirely fixed or reliable in this elusive metropolis. And yet conditions of anxiety within Johannesburg are seldom discussed by scholars.

Like any other city of the south, life in Johannesburg is fraught with the feelings that are central to modernity. What then does it mean that a city like Johannesburg so casually connotes anxiety to the north? And more importantly, if fearful emotion is the base layer of the modern age, as Bauman argues, what does it mean that we think more of anxiety about southern cities than in them?

In order to properly understand city life we need to account for its emotional landscapes. We must ask what it means to be an anxious modern citizen, subject to the same epistemological insecurities as people elsewhere, in a location that is often represented as inherently unstable.

These are some of the question that we asked of contributors to our new book Anxious Joburg, a set of essays and reflections that consider the intimate inner lives of Johannesburg. Rather than classifying it as a list of developmental and economic problems to be solved, these scholars, artists and storytellers consider what it feels like to live in this complicated city.

A broad range of people and experiences are explored, among them inner-city religious communities, young women who navigate perilous taxi mobility, nervous white middle classes, transgender migrants coping with South Africa's aggressive border regime and people scraping a precarious living on the city's outskirts.

From the gated community of Dainfern in the north to the township of Soweto in the south, from the liminal suburbs of Melville and Yeoville to the back rooms of Cyrildene and the apartment buildings of Hillbrow and the central business district, Anxious Joburg investigates the city's complex affects from multiple positions. It invokes a range of theoretical approaches - among them visual art, cultural studies, psychology and anthropology - to argue for the central role of emotion in understanding urban life in the global south.

When city forms are lumped together as merely the source of dangers that worry the north, it becomes difficult to grasp the current shape of the urban, which is likely to reach its ultimate expression in the expanding mega-cities of the south. As academics Sarah Nuttall and Achille Mbembe argue, we must develop ways of reading African cities that are no longer "dominated by the metanarrative of urbanisation, modernisation and crisis".

Part of this work requires us to consider intimate experiences of daily life. After all, as cultural theorist Sara Ahmed explains,

In southern cities, as elsewhere, emotions are performative and collective and have social and political consequences.

Johannesburg is not the most anxious or the most dangerous city in the world. It is not unique or uniquely terrifying. However its global reputation, spectacular racist history and propensity for siege architecture make it a hugely valuable site for thinking about how anxiety structures contemporary life for denizens of the southern city.

The new book Anxious Joburg: The Inner Lives of a Global South City is available from Wits University Press

On 29 September, the world's heads of state will come together (virtually) at an extraordinary meeting to discuss financing for development during the 75th UN general assembly. This will be crucial in the battle to address the Coronavirus crisis.

Our leaders will need to ask themselves this question: can we tackle a global recession while ensuring that basic human rights are protected, and the fight against poverty and environmental destruction are not completely run off the tracks?

TD 
	

The simple but harsh answer at this point in time, is that we cannot. The necessary global mechanisms and agreements are not in place, and unless governments urgently start working together to plug the gaps in the system, billions of people are likely to be heavily impacted by the Coronavirus crisis for years to come.

While the crisis is threatening up to half a billion people with poverty, the fortunes of the ultrawealthy are skyrocketing. Meanwhile, existing inequalities and discrimination, including those related to gender and race, are being reinforced by the Coronavirus crisis. National action is vital, but no country can address the global challenges alone.

Ahead of the heads of state meeting, a 'menu of options' for action has been published which includes key recommendations on debt, illicit financial flows, global liquidity and financial stability, among others. The heads of state must move from talk to action by agreeing to implement some of these recommendations and kickstart real intergovernmental negotiations to deliver new international frameworks and agreements.

At the top of the intergovernmental to-do list has to be debt resolution. The coronavirus crisis is creating a high risk of debt crises, especially in the Global South. And while the G20 response - to offer a standstill on bilateral debt to the poorest countries - has delayed the problem, it has done nothing to actually resolve it.

Even before the pandemic, there were clear warning signs that new debt crises were looming. This was alarming in light of the fact that we currently do not have an international mechanism to ensure that debt crises are resolved without undermining basic human rights of the people living in the impacted countries.

The good news is that the 'menu of options' includes concrete proposals for solutions, such as debt cancellations and an international UN debt workout mechanism. Now is high time for governments to get to work on these proposals.

Another top priority ought to be addressing tax havens, international tax dodging and other illicit financial flows. This problem has been causing a continuous bleeding of hundreds of billions of dollars annually from public budgets in both the Global North and South.

A core reason for this disaster is a deeply broken and outdated international corporate tax system. But here too, a clear and concrete proposal for a UN tax convention is part of the 'menu of options'. Such a convention could pave the way towards new international tax and transparency rules to combat tax dodging. What is missing is an international alliance of progressive countries that can increase international pressure for progress and action.

A third, and related, top priority for governments should be to address the broader economic problems, which are exacerbating the impacts of the crisis. Governments ought to agree a date and preparation process for a crisis summit under the UN's Financing for Development process, to be held at heads of state level as soon as practically possible.

The summit should follow up on previous commitments, which started with the Monterrey Consensus in 2002. Originally, governments had actually agreed to discuss a follow-up conference in 2019, but up to now have procrastinated and postponed the decision.

The sad reason for these delays is an old fight about control over economic decision-making processes. Countries in the Global South have been pushing for negotiations to start under the auspices of the UN, where all countries participate on an equal footing.

However, the countries in the Global North have blocked this and instead insisted that all decisions must be kept in opaque forums where they dominate the decision-making, including G20, IMF, the Paris Club and the OECD.

In 2014, when countries in the Global South wanted to start working on a UN debt resolution mechanism, constructive forces within the EU were drowned out by a small group of hardliners - and in particular the UK and Germany, and the EU ended up boycotting the process.

During a Financing for Development (FfD) summit in 2015 a group of countries in the Global North -with the UK and US in leading roles - put all their political muscle into blocking a proposal for a UN intergovernmental tax process put forward by the Global South countries.

This behavior has not only led to secret negotiations and unfair decisions that disregard the interests of the Global South, it has also led to a complete failure to develop effective solutions. By getting engulfed in a dirty fight to keep a large part of the world's countries out of decision-making processes, many otherwise progressive European countries acted against the interests of their own people, including by increasing the influence of some of the most obstructive powers.

This includes the Trump administration, but also some of the OECD countries that are very aggressive tax havens. But the coronavirus crisis seems to be causing some governments to crawl out of the trenches, and the high-level meeting this month provide an important opportunity.

75 years ago, the UN was set up to "achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character". In reality, the UN became the place where global agreements on human rights, sustainable development, peace and environmental protection are negotiated.

However, on economic issues, power-hungry developed countries have blocked UN cooperation. Unless we find fair and effective solutions to address economic and financial crises, it will not only undermine all the other UN objectives and agreements. It will also make the coronavirus crisis much longer and more disastrous than it has to be.

Under-Secretary of the United Nations Zainab Hawa Bangura is the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), a position she has held since 30 December 2019. Before her current appointment, she was the UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict. In this interview with Africa Renewal's Kingsley Ighobor, Ms. Bangura discusses gender and youth empowerment, the AU's "Silencing the Guns by 2020" initiative, among other issues. These are excerpts.

Let's begin with the elephant in the room--COVID-19. Given the current situation of the pandemic in Africa, what message do you have for Africans at this time?

TD 
	

My message is that Africa can defeat this deadly virus and recover even better. Africans are resilient. But the deaths, the dislocation to our way of life and the devastation to economies are enormous.

Many reports released so far, including the UN Secretary-General's policy brief on the impact of COVID-19 in Africa, indicate that tens of thousands of lives could be lost as well as billions of dollars of economic activity. The SG has for called for a debt freeze and up to $200 billion in support for poor countries to stimulate their economies. I believe too that a post-pandemic recovery is an opportunity for Africa to recover better.

Therefore, we must focus on sustainable development projects, including environmentally friendly ones, and pay greater attention to the empowerment of women, youth and the vulnerable population.

As the Director-General (DG) of UNON, what are your priority areas?

As you probably know, before my appointment UNON was without a full-time leader for over a year, so my first task was realigning divisions and departments into one cohesive unit to allow for shared strategies to meet the organization's objectives.

Second, we are building on the work of the previous DGs to bring recognition to UNON, which is the only UN headquarters in the Global South. Such recognition will of course attract the media, international conferences and other events. We have a clear vision and have set out our priorities and these include to help implement the Secretary-General's organization-wide reform initiatives. It also includes to raise public awareness of the UN's work in Kenya and in East Africa, to support other UN entities and to strengthen cooperation with other regional organizations.

As the DG, I am also available to help advance the SG's good offices in this region and preventive diplomacy, that is to mediate crises before they get out of hand.

How has your previous experience and work at the UN prepared you for your current job?

I used to be a civil society activist and was a minister of government in my country Sierra Leone [Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and then Minister of Health].

I had also worked with the UN in peacekeeping and later as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. These experiences reaffirm my passion for and commitment to women's issues, to good governance and sustainable development. For women in particular, we cannot make any advances in the areas of human rights, peace and security and development, without their contributions.

I consistently remind myself and my colleagues that our priorities and our work must uphold the principles of the UN Charter, which has at its core a focus on people, not just some abstract, impersonal processes.

What is the strategic importance of having a UN headquarters in the Global South?

The services the UN renders in the areas of peace, security, humanitarian response, human rights and development are brought closer to beneficiaries who live mostly in the global south.

UNON is unique in the sense that it has a mix of global headquarters, country and regional offices, Special Political Missions and peace support operations. It is the headquarters of the UN in Africa as well as the global headquarters for both UN Habitat and the UN Environment Programme. The work of the Nairobi-based UN entities contributes significantly to advancing UN goals and values--in Kenya, in the region and around the world.

One of the UN Secretary-General's priorities is gender parity within the UN system. How do you hope to achieve this goal at UNON?

We have a gender policy document that is widely disseminated among staff so everyone understands what the principles are. Senior managers regularly undertake training, including those administered by UN Women, on dealing with unconscious bias in recruitment of staff. Top managers are also requested to include in their workplans measures they hope to implement to achieve gender parity. Research has shown that expressing a number of years of experience as "desired" rather than "required" in job openings is more inviting for women.

In addition, our job openings include language that strongly encourages women to apply. We also try to more proactively reach out to qualified female candidates and to promote mobility options that support decisions by female applicants to come to Nairobi. So, on gender issues, we are making progress on many fronts.

As a former civil society activist, how do you see the role of women in Africa's development?

As I mentioned earlier, women have an important, even indispensable role, to play in countries' development. When women are absent at the negotiating table, you have entrenched mindsets. But when women are present, chances of an agreement are high. And let's remember women's role in global multilateral agenda.

The Secretary-General [António Guterres] remarked during the "She Stands for Peace" book launch last February that the advocacy of women peacebuilders, particularly those in Africa, helped create the momentum 20 years ago that resulted in the Security Council's Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS).

That was the first time that women were recognized not only as victims of war but as people with agency and expertise who could help find peaceful solutions to conflict. Since then, there have been nine additional Security Council resolutions on WPS, in addition to several African Union instruments. Gender inequality is, as we know, a question of power.

It is very important that more women are in positions of responsibility, in both the public and private sectors, to unlock dormant socioeconomic and peace dividends that will advance Africa's development.

The UN is supporting the African Union's Silencing the Guns by 2020 campaign. Given your experience coming from a post-conflict country, why do you think the guns must be silent in Africa?

There can be no development without peace and security, which is why the AU launched the "Silencing the Guns by 2020" initiative. To be fair, considerable progress has been made in silencing the guns in many parts of Africa, but at the same time we have witnessed just how difficult the task is because we still have many intractable conflicts.

The UN supports the AU's initiative--there are ongoing joint efforts between the UN and the African Peace and Security Architecture of the AU to strengthen the conflict prevention capacities of member states.

To fully silence the guns will require addressing the root causes of conflict and these include issues such as the illicit proliferation of arms on the continent, the impact of climate change, inequitable management of countries' natural resources, socioeconomic inequalities and other governance issues such as the exclusion of women and youth in the electoral process.

What role could young people play in peace and development of Africa?

I will echo what the Secretary-General said last year at the AU Summit, which is that Africa's youth need to be engaged and empowered because they are agents of change. We cannot achieve sustainable development without the partnership and participation of young people. I believe, strongly, that young people have an important role to play in achieving peace, security, stability and good governance in Africa. We need their ideas and their energy. We have seen what young people can do in terms of, for example, using technology to solve problems. Their ability to mobilise using technology, to raise awareness among the wider population of important social issues, is incredible.

Many African states are low-income and fragile, and there are continuing threats to peace and security, including in the form of ethnic disputes. So, we must equally realise that many groups wishing to foment trouble in countries begin by enlisting young people. Countries and development-focused institutions such as the African Development Bank and the World Bank must therefore invest in the youth in terms of quality education and skills acquisition.

We must recognise the need for the creation of an enabling economic environment, including providing employment opportunities and services such as energy, healthcare, modern transport infrastructure that young people need to enable them flourish. Commendably, the AU's silencing the guns initiative includes a strong focus on youth. I'm confident in the potential of Africa's youth to change the development narrative of the continent.

Nelson Mandela, father of the nation and a global icon whose noble actions and legacy of active citizenship continue to inspire many, seven years on from his passing.

On the 18th of July, which is Nelson Mandela International Day, the world comes together to celebrate Mandela's birthday and honour his legacy by taking action and making a positive impact on the world. The day was officially declared by the United Nations in November 2009, with the first UN Mandela Day held on 18 July 2010. The day is a call to action for people to spare 67 minutes of their time to help the less fortunate and ideally make everyday a Mandela day.

TD 
	

Ms Xolisile Sithole, a Global South African living in Chengdu, China celebrated Mandela International Day with other Global South Africans and citizens of Chengdu with a Nelson Mandela Appreciation dinner.

"The is dinner is a thank you to Mandela for all that he did for South Africa and all its people. We served a nine-course dinner, at Fairmont Hotel Chengdu, with each dish representing a South African province essence. Thank you to Fairmont's Executive chef Eddie Mair for his creativity and enthusiasm for this event as well as South African Culinary Lecturer, Ayanda Mda for curating the menu", expressed Ms Sithole.

Having spent 27 years in prison, and being an advocate for freedom it goes without saying that Mandela's message rings more true in the year 2020. A year that has highlighted the value and importance of freedom, since COVID-19 shifted and changed everything society had come to know as the norm.

"I am so grateful to Brand South Africa's Global South African programme for their support. To the Nelson Mandela Foundation for continuing the life of Nelson Mandela and to South African Tourism for gifts for all of the guests. Thank you, to Fairmont Chengdu for their hospitality and beautiful venue, I am so excited to have hosted this precious event with you", further adds Ms Sithole.

In the words of Mandela; "When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his country, he can rest in peace. I believe I have made that effort and that is, therefore, why I will sleep for the eternity."

"These words resonate power and Mandela Day is a day for everyone, an aide-mémoire for us all of the importance of liberation be it from ourselves, others, or injustices that we may face in the world. Keep resting, Tata we will continue living the legacy" concludes Sithole.

HD 	The SDGs, COVID-19 and the Global South - Insights From the Sustainable Development Report 2020

COVID-19 has claimed more than 550,000 lives and disrupted the entire world, sparing no region. As of July 2020, the number of daily new confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 are growing rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean, especially in Brazil and Mexico but also in many African countries as well as India. As highlighted in a recent article, these numbers are likely underestimated given the reduced testing capacity in many low and middle-income countries.

The Effective Reproduction Rate (ERR), defined as the average number of infections that an infected individual transmits to susceptible individuals, is above 1 in many African and Latin American countries and in India. An ERR of less than 1 signifies effective suppression, while an ERR above 1 signifies ongoing epidemic conditions. Countries in the Asia-Pacific, such as Taiwan or Vietnam, have largely suppressed the virus, although they must remain vigilant.

TD 
	

COVID-19 has especially affected the achievement of the SDGs, and has produced many negative short-term impacts on most SDGs. For instance, an estimated 71 million people are expected to be pushed back into extreme poverty in 2020. These negative impacts are amplified in low-income countries and vulnerable population groups, especially in the Global South. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly everyone globally, poor and vulnerable populations, including low-skilled workers and refugees, are suffering far more in terms of lost lives, vulnerability to infection, declining incomes, and unemployment.

One of the major findings of this year's Sustainable Development Report (SDR2020) is that before the COVID-19 outbreak, the world was making progress towards the SDGs. Although no country was on track to achieve the SDGs, the evolution of the SDG Index scores (included in the Sustainable Development Report) between 2010 and 2019 suggests some convergence, with regions and income groups that had lower SDG Index scores in 2010 progressing faster. Due to time lags in data generation and reporting, these results represent the situation before COVID-19. In particular, areas of the Global South, including sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean made significant progress during the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) period (2000-2015) and also showed progress on the SDGs. However, of all United Nations regions, East and South Asia demonstrated the most progress on the SDGs.

The report also highlighted significant disparities in progress across the goals and countries. For example, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Cambodia improved the most on the SDGs, while Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and the Republic of the Congo regressed the most.

Globalisation facilitates the rapid spread of viruses around the world. At the same time, concerted international action by policymakers, the private sector, civil society, and the scientific community can accelerate the identification of solutions.

The current crisis, including hostilities among major powers, raises the spectre of global conflict instead of global cooperation. It was Charles Kindleberger's thesis in 1929-1939 that the Great Depression was so severe because there was no global leader (or "hegemon") and no adequate cooperation among the major powers. The result, he argued, was a breakdown of the global monetary and trading system that paved the way to Nazi Germany and World War II.

The SDR2020 proposes five key global cooperation measures to address the health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis:

The world urgently needs to learn from and to emulate the strategies for fighting COVID-19 adopted in the East Asia and the Pacific regions. The World Health Organisation (WHO) should facilitate rapid dissemination of best practices. This is one of the objectives of the newly created Lancet Commission on COVID-19 chaired by SDSN President and leading economist, Jeffrey Sachs.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created for global crises like this one. It needs ample firepower, including far greater latitude to extend credits, either under existing facilities or through a new issuance of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Private creditors will need to refinance or capitalise on debts falling due.

We need global support for the lead United Nations agencies, including the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the World Food Program (WFP), so that they can best fight impending hunger crises and food insecurity.

As part of any comprehensive response to the pandemic, governments should promote new instruments of social protection. This includes the new Global Fund for Social Protection that was proposed to address SDG 1 (No Poverty) even before the pandemic, and is now needed even more so.

Financing research and development (R&D) for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines is an urgent global public good. Without global cooperation, R&D will be inadequate and duplicative. And when breakthroughs are achieved, they will in turn require global cooperation to ensure mass uptake. The Global Fund and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, are two exemplary institutions that serve as historical precedents for what will be needed for the rapid uptake of new drugs and vaccines and how to lead the effort on the ground.

Timely data is also a critical component of overcoming COVID-19. The SDR2020 underscores the need for more timely and disaggregated data in many parts of the world, especially the Global South, to track and address the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 on different population groups. SDSN in partnership with Esri and National Geographic, recently launched a new platform, SDGs Today, with real-time and timely data for the SDGs. All datasets are updated regularly (at least annually), and they have each been curated and validated by SDSN's Thematic Research Network on Data and Statistics (TReNDS).

As we move forward, the priority of every government must be to continue to contain and suppress the virus. As COVID-19 continues to infect a growing number of people in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and South Asia, strengthening public health systems and providing access to personal protective equipment and large-scale testing is essential in the absence of a treatment or vaccine. Furthermore, international solidarity and partnerships are critical to address and prevent health, economic, and humanitarian crises and to avoid major setbacks on the SDGs in the short and long-term.

HD 	Malnutrition and Epidemics Are Intertwined. That Makes Fixing Food Systems Crucial

Malnutrition is by far the biggest driver of ill-health and premature mortality in every region of the world. A slow-burn attritional problem, it does enormous damage.

The COVID-19 epidemic that's sweeping the world, meanwhile, brings a series of massive short-wave shocks. Both the epidemic and malnutrition will generate long-wave impacts, for years to come. They are also likely to interact with each other - badly.

TD 
	

This will be particularly true in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Many of these countries' governments, health and food systems, communities and households have limited capacity to respond to nutritional challenges or to an epidemic. This means that the potential exists for malnutrition to exacerbate the health consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic, and vice versa.

A year before this virus appeared on the world stage, a pioneering Lancet Commission called for "a radical rethink of business models, food systems, civil society involvement, and national and international governance" to address the interlinked crises of obesity, undernutrition, and climate change. Now COVID-19 can be added to that list.

To address these interacting crises, a comprehensive multisectoral response is needed that revolves around strengthening community and state capacity and resilience to future shocks.

Malnutrition comes in several forms. These include undernutrition, overweight and obesity, along with associated diet-related non-communicable diseases.

The vicious cycle between undernutrition and immune health has been known for half a century. That's when the term "nutritionally acquired immune deficiency syndrome" was first used. Undernutrition can heighten the severity and duration of several diseases, especially pneumonia. Ill health can exacerbate undernutrition in several ways, including the compromised absorption of nutrients.

On the other side of the spectrum, obese adults - whose immune systems are chronically activated to respond to inflammation - are also likely to be at greater risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms. Excess weight can compromise the ability of lungs to take in oxygen; people living with obesity tend to have poor cardiovascular health, to be less physically active and to be diabetic.

It's early days in terms of what scientists do and don't know. But new data from the UK and the US suggest obesity is indeed associated with higher novel coronavirus death rates.

We also know that COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that spreads rapidly in overcrowded contexts where many people are in frequent close contact. Insanitary conditions, such as those in the sorts of urban slums and refugee camps that are common in the global south, increase the risk of rapid spread.

Malnutrition is common to both urban populations and refugee camps. And urban populations are more likely than their rural counterparts to consume ultra-processed foods, which are widely available and known to significantly increase the risk of obesity and other non-communicable diseases.

Given all this, it is certain that COVID-19 epidemics will interact with malnutrition and food insecurity in the global south. Some of these connections are already clear, in the way that food systems operate, or don't, during a pandemic. Any shock to a food system will hit the poorest households hardest, via numerous pathways: higher food prices, less purchasing power, reduced ability to stockpile, higher risk of losing jobs, and a lack of safety nets.

COVID-19 doesn't only present a massive current challenge for food systems. It both exposes and amplifies the inequitable way in which they operate, especially with regard to nutrition well-being.

Seven years ago, the presciently titled paper "Profit and Pandemics" highlighted the increasing damage being wrought by transnational food company marketing of ultra-processed foods in the global south. Since then, experts have learned a lot more about the harm these foods cause to nutrition and health. This harm may now translate into greater risk of severe COVID-19 disease for millions.

The response to these interlinked crises needs to be comprehensive, cross-sectoral and it needs to be rapidly mobilised from national to grass-roots levels. Countries in the global south will also need support from the international community.

In addition to proven health interventions for controlling viral spread, there's a critical need to develop, strengthen and "COVID-proof" social protection systems to protect the most vulnerable households.

With regard to food systems, the state has to take the lead in highlighting healthy diets for all as a central goal. Here it can re-learn the lessons from past AIDS epidemics about the importance of human rights. Not only will this help protect populations now, it will pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable food system on the other side of the pandemic.

HD 	Open Letter to Gilead - Global Civil Society Calls For No Patents or Exclusivities on Potential COVID-19 Treatment

Mr Daniel O'Day

Chief Executive Officer

TD 
	

Gilead Science, Inc.

30 March 2020

Open letter to Gilead concerning ensuring access to remdesivir

Dear Mr O'Day,

We write to request that Gilead take immediate actions to ensure rapid availability, affordability, and

accessibility of its experimental therapy remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19, pending the results of

the clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across all continents and, to date, over 720,000 people have been

infected, causing more than 30,000 deaths. Making effective therapeutics available and accessible rapidly

for all people based on their medical needs is essential for all countries to combat the pandemic and may

save many thousands of lives.

We are seriously concerned with Gilead's current approach to remdesivir, which may obscure access to

this potentially critical treatment for COVID-19. Gilead holds primary patents of remdesivir in more than

70 countries that may block generic entry until 2031. Despite public health emergency declarations in

multiple states and cities in the United States (US) since the end of February, Gilead still sought an orphan

drug designation from the US Food and Drug Administration on remdesivir with the aim to obtain further

exclusive rights in the US, and only applied to rescind this exclusivity after public criticism in late March.

Recently, faced with an overwhelming demand for individual compassionate use of remdesivir, Gilead

announced its inability to ensure timely supply and reduced the scale of the programme.

The COVID-19 pandemic affects every person. It is unacceptable for Gilead's remdesivir to be put under

the company's exclusive control taking into account that the drug was developed with considerable public

funding for both early-stage research and clinical trials, the extraordinary efforts and personal risks that

both healthcare workers and patients have faced in using the medicine in clinical trial settings, and the

unprecedented disaster all countries are facing for their people, their healthcare systems, and their

economies. Gilead has a poor track record for ensuring universal access to lifesaving treatments and the

company's recent actions with remdesivir provide scant assurance that the company can be trusted to act

in the public interest.

We request Gilead to fully recognise the scale and potential consequences of pursuing exclusive rights as

opposed to enabling the scale-up of production and affordable supply of remdesivir during this pandemic.

We therefore urge Gilead to take immediate actions to:

- Declare that Gilead will not enforce and claim exclusive rights on patents and regulatory and trial data,

or any other types of exclusivity anywhere in the world;

- make publicly available all data, sample products, and know-how that are needed for generic

development and for regulatory processes, to facilitate the production and supply by generic

manufacturers worldwide; and

- improve transparency by disclosing its manufacturing capacity and existing supply and allow

independent and proper governance over the allocation of the treatment according to medical needs.

An exclusivity and monopoly-based approach will fail the world in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gilead must act in the public interest now.

Dear Mr O'Day,

We write to request that Gilead take immediate actions to ensure rapid availability, affordability, and

accessibility of its experimental therapy remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19, pending the results of

the clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across all continents and, to date, over 720,000 people have been

infected, causing more than 30,000 deaths. Making effective therapeutics available and accessible rapidly

for all people based on their medical needs is essential for all countries to combat the pandemic and may

save many thousands of lives.

We are seriously concerned with Gilead's current approach to remdesivir, which may obscure access to

this potentially critical treatment for COVID-19. Gilead holds primary patents of remdesivir in more than

70 countries that may block generic entry until 2031. Despite public health emergency declarations in

multiple states and cities in the United States (US) since the end of February, Gilead still sought an orphan

drug designation from the US Food and Drug Administration on remdesivir with the aim to obtain further

exclusive rights in the US, and only applied to rescind this exclusivity after public criticism in late March.

Recently, faced with an overwhelming demand for individual compassionate use of remdesivir, Gilead

announced its inability to ensure timely supply and reduced the scale of the programme.

The COVID-19 pandemic affects every person. It is unacceptable for Gilead's remdesivir to be put under

the company's exclusive control taking into account that the drug was developed with considerable public

funding for both early-stage research and clinical trials, the extraordinary efforts and personal risks that

both healthcare workers and patients have faced in using the medicine in clinical trial settings, and the

unprecedented disaster all countries are facing for their people, their healthcare systems, and their

economies. Gilead has a poor track record for ensuring universal access to lifesaving treatments and the

company's recent actions with remdesivir provide scant assurance that the company can be trusted to act

in the public interest.

We request Gilead to fully recognise the scale and potential consequences of pursuing exclusive rights as

opposed to enabling the scale-up of production and affordable supply of remdesivir during this pandemic.

We therefore urge Gilead to take immediate actions to:

- Declare that Gilead will not enforce and claim exclusive rights on patents and regulatory and trial data,

or any other types of exclusivity anywhere in the world;

- make publicly available all data, sample products, and know-how that are needed for generic

development and for regulatory processes, to facilitate the production and supply by generic

manufacturers worldwide; and

- improve transparency by disclosing its manufacturing capacity and existing supply and allow

independent and proper governance over the allocation of the treatment according to medical needs.

An exclusivity and monopoly-based approach will fail the world in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gilead must act in the public interest now.

With over 16,000 deaths globally and the number of cases growing each day, the calamitous impacts of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) are already being felt. As the virus continues to spread, the human impact in the Global South has the potential to be catastrophic as it strains weak and underfunded health systems. The economic impacts will also be devastating, with preliminary estimates predicting an income shortfall of $220 billion in developing countries (excluding China)and a GDP decrease of at least $25 billion in Africa.

TD 
	

While secondary to the public health emergency, it is important to consider how the pandemic will affect tax revenues in the Global South, given that these are critical to providing public services and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. While governments anticipate losing revenue from a range of sources, local taxation is particularly vulnerable and affects a larger proportion of taxpayers in low-income countries than direct central government or trade taxes.

Sierra Leone's catastrophic experience of the Ebola epidemic--which killed more than 3,900 peoplein Sierra Leone alone--offers an important case study of the impacts on local government revenues and the fiscal burdens of ordinary citizens. The indirect economic effects of the crisis were significant, with individuals losing livelihoods, governments losing the capacity to fund basic services, and individuals and communities bearing a greater direct cost of public goods provision.

Although no cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Sierra Leone yet, there are cases in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia and, as President Bio declared in a national address last week, "It is no longer a question of whether the Corona Virus will come to Sierra Leone, it is a question of WHEN."

In Sierra Leone, local government tax revenues unsurprisingly fell during the Ebola epidemic. Although the revenue losses were fairly small in absolute terms, their impact was significant given the low baseline. Indeed, from 2005 to 2017, local governments collected tax revenue amounting on average to only 17 cents per capita -- so little that they could barely do more than pay for basic administrative costs. And the fiscal situation is much worse outside the relatively high-revenue Western area (the capital, Freetown, and the surrounding Western Area Rural district). In the provinces, where 79% of the population lives, local tax revenue amounted to on average only 6 cents per capita per year over the same period. With this baseline, any revenue loss can have devastating impacts on local governance and service delivery.

Some local revenues were simply no longer available due to economic lockdowns and social distancing containment measures. For example, markets were closed during the crisis, leaving the government unable to collect market fees and rents in some areas. This was significant as market dues made up on average 23% of total local revenues from 2005 to 2016. Due to COVID-19, the Sierra Leonean and sub-national governments are currently taking preventative containment measures that may similarly limit economic and taxable activity, including restricting market and street trading hoursand banning gatherings of more than 100 people. These containment and social distancing measures are likely to only get more stringent.

With schools, markets, and many businesses closed during the Ebola crisis, many citizens faced extreme economic hardship. In response, local governments issued an effective amnesty on the most commonly paid tax at the local level--the local (poll) tax that is levied on all adults. In my interviews with local government officials, I found that this was based in part on moral economy justifications that it was simply not right to make people pay. Similar justifications were used to explain the non-collection of other local taxes, with leniency of enforcement being a normal, if ad hoc and informal, response to the economic situation.

As a result of the lack of online infrastructure for tax assessment and payment, many local taxes became too risky to collect. For property taxes, for example, tax bills are delivered by hand to individual properties and all payments must be made in person at banks or the local government office. Face-to-face interaction goes from being an inconvenience and accountability risk in normal times to a major public health risk during times of contagion.

While local government tax collection efforts diminished significantly during the Ebola crisis, citizens were not relieved of their fiscal burdens. Indeed, Sierra Leoneans contribute considerably to public goods provision and community mobilization efforts through userfees and informal taxation--and have to do so to a greater extent when local services are underfunded.

Sierra Leone's public health system is woefully underfunded, with a significant proportion of financing coming from user fees. Not only does this discourage low-income individuals from accessing healthcare, it means that individuals bear a significant part of financing the health system. Public clinics often have nurses and staff that are not on government salaries or receive delayed salaries, which results in the common practice of charging extra fees or having bribes or non-monetary "gifts" effectively required in order to access treatment and essential medicines. In a survey of taxpayers in eastern and northern Sierra Leone conducted in 2017, for example, I found that more than a fifth of individuals had made informal payments to doctors or nurses in the previous year and more than a fifth had contributed labour for the construction or maintenance of public health facilities.

At the same time, donor funding during and immediately after the Ebola epidemic shifted from funding public services like education to emergency humanitarian and public health needs. While evidently necessary, this shift in aid funding resulted in shifting the burden of financing local public goods and services - including schools, teachers, and water wells - onto individuals and communities.

Shifting the financial responsibility of essential services, governance, and public infrastructure from the state onto citizens results in inequitable outcomes: The degree and quality of access to public goods depends on the relative wealth of a particular area and access to essential goods depend on the ability to pay. Moreover, as user fees and informal taxes are generally charged at a flat rate, they are overwhelmingly regressive, while my research further shows that the burden of user fees and informal taxes is significantly higher for women.

While there was a massive increase in international aid during the Ebola crisis, individuals and communities contributed substantially to crisis response efforts. Traditional authorities were central in containment efforts, introducing chiefdom level by-laws to restrict movement and activity; community tracers were critical in identifying at-risk individuals; and community patrols were vital to preventing the movement of people within and across the most affected areas. Though in some areas chiefs received substantial international support, they also relied on communal labour and contributions to support local mobilization efforts. As explained to me by a District Council Chairman during my research, much of the effort was "self-funded, through... the people."

The burden was exacerbated by the unfortunate fact that millions in emergency fundswent missing, leaving frontline officials and response teams unpaid--and thus reliant on community support and contributions to get by. Such contributions, while they may have added to the burden of regular people during a difficult time, were a central part of the community mobilization that allowed the country to eventually overcome the epidemic.

While the current global pandemic is unique in many respects, in the Global South it is also likely to have significant direct health effects, in terms of loss of life, and indirect economic effects, including individuals losing livelihoods and governments losing the capacity to fund basic services. While public health and security concerns are of course paramount, the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone demonstrates how the negative effects for vulnerable populations are compounded when local governments are forced to cut back on services and individuals are effectively made to bear a greater cost of public goods provision through user fees and informal taxes.

While international policymakers' first priority is to contain the pandemic, they can also learn valuable lessons from West Africa's experience with Ebolain order to minimise the real costs for citizens of developing countries in the short and long-term:

Urgently provide crisis response financing: The international response to the Ebola crisis was slow to arrive, after the epidemic had already spiralled out of control. While the IMF and World Bank have announced $50 billionand $14 billionin global financing, respectively, far more will be needed - and quickly - in grants and low- and no-interest loans, to not only address the health emergency but provide critical cushioning for the economic impacts.

Measure impacts to tailor the response: Systematic crisis monitoringiscrucial for enabling governments totarget support and mitigate the most severe effects for vulnerable groups. During the Ebola epidemic for example, researchers made use of existing sampling frames to conduct mobile phone surveys, gathering almost real-time data on which households and businesses were experiencing the greatest health and economic hardships. The willingness and capacity of donor and researchers to similarly be agile and adapt programmes to meet new and pressing data collection objectives will be particularly important to systematically measure and respond to the impacts of COVID-19.

Invest in health systems now: Unfortunately, the lessons from Ebola did not translate into the required investmentsin public health systems and pandemic preparedness. Only 3% of international recommendations for financing preparedness efforts have been achieved by the international community, with 50% seeing little to no progress. A review by the World Bank estimates that it would cost on average $1.69 per capitato finance appropriate pandemic preparedness in low- and middle-income countries. In the long-term, this implies that countries need to strengthen equitable taxationin order to ensure sustainable financing for public health and other essential goods in the future. Otherwise, my research shows that where there are financing shortfalls, individuals and communities will fill the gaps and feel the pain.

HD 	How Waste Pickers in the Global South Are Being Sidelined By New Policies

The world is producing more and more waste, with serious health and environmental consequences. In urban areas, domestic waste is accumulating fast and landfills fill up quickly.

Public authorities are trying to manage this problem in new ways. In the global South these tend to involve private corporations and expensive technology rather than waste pickers. This policy shift towards the privatising of waste management is limiting waste pickers' access to recyclable materials.

TD 
	

This is happening despite the fact that waste pickers are responsible for a very high percentage of recycling. By collecting, sorting and selling discarded materials waste pickers deal with between 20% and 50% of the overall generated waste.

Sidelining waste pickers is leading to conflicts, which a group of researchers and activists are tracking. The Barcelona Research Group on Informal Recyclers - in collaboration with EnvJustice, the Global Alliance of Waste Pickers and Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) - has released a map showing conflicts related to informal recyclers.

The map is a selection from the Environmental Justice Atlas of 50 conflicts in Africa, Asia and Latin America in which waste pickers are fighting for social and environmental justice. The map makes it easy to see who loses and who benefits from policy shifts.

Historically, waste pickers have been confronted with dangerous working conditions, social marginalisation and persecution. The map shows how this precarious situation is getting worse.

Waste, once freely available to the poor, is being appropriated for business purposes. As a result, private corporations obtain large profits, while waste pickers loose their livelihood.

Meanwhile society at large looses the environmental benefits of recycling.

The informal recycling sector is a way of making a living for 19 million to 24 million people in the global South, according to the International Labour Organisation. Their skills and knowledge about materials such as metals, plastics and paper enables them to give items a value.

They provide services to society free of cost, but their work and rights are not always fully recognised. In some countries, such as Brazil and Colombia they are strongly organised in cooperatives and associations. This enables them to voice their claims and even formally take up municipal waste services.

In the past decade, threats to waste picker livelihoods in the global South have been triggered by shifts in public policy towards privatised formal management of urban waste. This has taken three main forms: incineration, privatisation and urban space restrictions.

Incineration: these technologies get large public subsidies, for example as emissions reduction projects from the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. The first incinerator in Africa was built in Ethiopia in 2018 with Chinese investment and Danish technology. National bans on incineration are being challenged from the Philippines to Mexico.

But research shows that recycling is always preferable to burning. This is true both socially in terms of the livelihoods of waste pickers as well as environmentally for Co2 emissions and risks of air pollution.

In Delhi waste pickers and residents have allied against incineration.

Privatisation: corporations have become increasingly interested in waste as a resource. For example in Johannesburg, the Genesis landfill was privatised and waste pickers got violently evicted. Formal criteria for contracting municipal waste management services that are being put in place end up excluding waste pickers, for example in Egypt and Ghana.

The closure of problematic landfills has often led to the simple shifting of environmental damage in places like Belém and Rio de Janeiro as well.

Restrictions in urban space: these can affect waste pickers, and their livelihoods. An example is the prohibition of animal or human-drawn vehicles. Such examples can be seen in Porto Alegre and Montevideo.

Another example is the installation of "anti-poor", "smart" containers in Buenos Aires and Bogota.

And, in the name of modern, beautiful and hygienic city centres, waste pickers are denied access to certain urban areas, like in Phnom Penh.

Waste pickers are increasingly taking action to oppose policies that exclude them from their source of livelihood. The main areas of focus are social rights and formal inclusion into municipal waste management. They also organise to make their environmental services visible, fight discrimination and empower their communities. This is happening mostly in Latin American countries. But it's also happening in South Africa and India, among others.

The Global Alliance of Waste Pickers, supported by the nongovernmental organisation Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing, works with organisations in more than 28 countries. Their aim is to include waste pickers in decision-making, improve their working conditions, develop their capacity and achieve recognition for their work. Civil society groups have also formed a network in the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives.

Recognition of the contribution that waste pickers make is growing in some countries. But most still face social marginalisation, highly unsuitable working and living conditions, and most recently a global trend of privatisation of waste management that threatens to deprive them completely of their livelihood.

Fihima Mohamed's mother never attended school and until two years ago she could not read or write. Mohamed's mother had been born in neighbouring Somalia but was sent to Djibouti as a young girl to live with her aunt. The expectation had been that she would have a better life by escaping the ongoing conflict in her home country at the time.

Instead, Mohamed's mother became a domestic servant to her aunt -- a circumstance that showed her that her own daughter's future would be just as difficult if she too did not go to school.

TD 
	

Born and raised in the Republic of Djibouti, Mohamed told IPS that most of her childhood was spent in school or studying.

Between the ages of six and 16 years, she was driven by the vivid pictures her mother painted of the life that awaited her if she did not stay in school and perform well -- one of domestic abuse. "I was told that as a woman, education would give me freedom," she said, remembering how her mother was not able to make major household decisions and did not have the freedom to determine what direction her life took.

But her mother did make a decision that determined the course of Mohamed's life. She opted not to buy the fish her children enjoyed so much for their meals and instead spent the money on private tuition classes for her daughter to supplement her schooling.

"I attended public school during the day, and at night, two hours of private school tuition. My mother sacrificed a lot to raise 25 dollars per month to pay for these night classes," she said, explaining that she went to those classes not for her own sake but also so that she could help her three younger siblings with their homework.

The sacrifice paid off and Mohamed was placed among the country's top-five students for her high school final exam. She received a scholarship to study in France for four years.

Fast track to 2020, Mohamed holds a bachelor's degree in law and political science, and a Master's degree in refugee studies. She is a social entrepreneur, a gender and environment activist and the founder of the Women Initiative, a local social movement for the empowerment of women and girls.

She said that Djibouti is among a growing list of developing countries were education attainment levels have significantly narrowed between boys and girls. United Nations statistics indicate that the gross primary school enrolment rates for girls have risen to nearly 61 percent.

This emerged during the 3rd International Summit on Balanced and Inclusive Education that is currently being held in Djibouti City, in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti.

Organised by the Education Relief Foundation (ERF), over 200 delegates and government representatives from over 35 countries rallied behind an education pathway that leaves no one behind.

According to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2020, there is an increasing number of countries in the global south where, on average, educational attainment gaps are now relatively small.

These countries include Cambodia, Kenya, Cuba, Myanmar and Ethiopia.

In Myanmar, for instance, primary school enrolment rates stand at 88 percent for girls, and 90 percent for boys.

Additionally, in secondary level, enrolment rate for girls is at 62 percent and 57 percent for boys.

Even at tertiary level, enrolment rates for girls stand at 19 percent, compared to 13 percent for boys.

Countries struggling with gender parity in education include Togo, Burkina Faso and Burundi.

Togolese Prime Minister Komi Selom, Klassou confirmed that alarming gender inequalities exist, despite the existence of innovative strategies towards an inclusive education system.

"We have school canteens to provide school free meals, free medical cover for school-going children and the newly approved year-on-year budgetary increase to the education sector," he said during the summit.

The Global Gender Gap Report indicates that in Togo, enrolment in primary school is at 88 percent among girls, and 94 percent for boys.

Secondary school enrolment for girls is at 34 percent for girls and 49 percent for boys.

At tertiary level, 10 percent of girls enrol vis-à-vis 19 percent of boys.

"Efforts to narrow this gap include a new government commitment to allocate at least 25 percent of its national budget to the education sector," he said.

Mohamed told IPS that ongoing consultations on education will bring the global south a step closer towards "building fairer and more inclusive economies by transforming our education systems to ensure that every child has access to quality education".

She explained that ultimately the idea was to embrace an education system that reflects the reality of children in the global south. This also included improving educational infrastructure and content so that the latter could be more diverse to reflect the multiple-cultural narrative of the global south.

Nonetheless, Sheikh Manssour Bin Mussallam, President of ERF, emphasised that balanced and inclusive education systems are not solely about having more children in classrooms, but the "construction of systems that makes exclusion impossible".

"Our education systems should guarantee that marginalised groups participate under balanced and equitable conditions. The transformative power of education is only true if education itself is transformed and driven by forces that uphold equality and equity," he said during the opening day of the summit.

Data by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) shows that existing education systems are far from equitable, prosperous and sustainable.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 21 percent of girls are much more likely to be out of school at primary school age compared to 16 percent of boys.

Globally, UNESCO statistics indicate that sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have the worst rates of education exclusion. One in four children in South Asia, and one in five children in sub-Saharan Africa will never enter school.

Equally alarming, World Bank statistics show that children with a disability are more likely to never enrol in school at all. Overall, only one in four children with disabilities complete secondary school.

Additionally, primary school completion rates are 10 percentage points lower for girls with disabilities compared to girls without disabilities.

"In Sri Lanka where girls are consistently outpacing boys in both education access and achievement, our main challenge is lack of financial and technical resources to address the [requirements] of special needs children," P.C.K. Pirisyala, director of education at the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service, told IPS.

"Developing countries are grappling with a lack of teachers to provide adequate training and material to provide disability-inclusive education," she said.

She further said that a lack of resources (both technical and financial) and a lack of schools equipped to accommodate special needs children has made it difficult for these children in the global south to access education and participate with their peers.

"This forum will provide the global south with a roadmap that reflects these realities, and bring us closer to the dream of balanced and inclusive education for all by 2030. This is all in line with the [U.N.] sustainable development goal four on education for all," she concluded.

The summit runs until Wednesday, Jan. 29.

HD 	Ethiopian Teff - the Fight Against Biopiracy

A controversial patent on Ethiopia's national cereal teff is about to be terminated -- thanks, in part, to the initiative of a German lawyer. But the problem of biopiracy is far from solved.

Teff, also known as dwarf millet, is to Ethiopia what maize is to Mexico and rice is to China: the country's most important foodstuff, the basis for the national dish injera -- a soft, spongy, pancake-like bread -- and an important part of its cultural heritage.

TD 
	

Farmers in the Ethiopian highlands started cultivating teff 3,000 years ago.

Perhaps understandably, many Ethiopians are annoyed that a Dutch company holds a patent on processed teff flour. To this day, in some European countries, no flour from the gluten-free and nutrient-rich super grain may be sold without paying royalties to the Netherlands. This could soon change, and it if it does it will be partly due to the private initiative of a German lawyer.

'Teff belongs to the Ethiopians'

Ethiopians find it particularly perfidious that the Dutch company in question started by conducting research on teff together with the Ethiopian state and agreed to share the genetic information obtained for commercial use. But in 2004, it filed a patent alone.

The European Patent Office granted it a monopoly on a wide range of products made from teff in Europe. This caused consternation in Ethiopia. "People said: What are the Dutch doing? Teff belongs to the Ethiopians, not the Europeans," recalls Azeb Tadesse-Hahn, cultural editor at DW's Amharic desk.

Is it possible to patent a plant which has been a basic food staple in a country for thousands of years? It's complicated, says Anton Horn, a lawyer from Düsseldorf who specializes in patent law.

In principle, international agreements exclude plants from patenting. But there is a loophole: the upstream and downstream value chain of a plant. "When the plant is processed into a foodstuff, technology is used," Horn told DW. "If you develop something new and inventive, why not get a patent on it?"

The computer doesn't know

This is how the company argued its case, said Horn. "The patent did not concern a plant, but its processed form, namely flour." Although it was neither new nor inventive to make flour from teff seeds, the patent was granted anyway for structural reasons. "The examiner in front of his computer has four hours to complete the whole process of searching the databases. And if nothing appears in those databases, then it's new from his perspective."

Traditional knowledge and cultural heritage from countries of the global south are seldom available in written form. "And what is not written down often does not exist in the databases and is ignored," said Horn.

Teff flour just one of many cases

Activists call this biopiracy: the act of marketing plants or other biological material from the global south without sharing the profits with the countries of origin. The Dutch teff flour patent is not an isolated case, said Jim Thomas, deputy head of the Canadian non-governmental organization ETC Group, which monitors how new technologies and corporate strategies affect farmers and the environment. "Unfortunately, the patent system has evolved over the past 30 or 40 years in such a way that companies often patent not only technical inventions, but entire species and natural species and their uses," he said.

Examples are patents on the value-added chains of rooibos tea from South Africa or bean varieties from Mexico and parts of Africa that have been used by the locals for generations. "The development and free exchange of plant varieties over thousands of years is the basis of our agriculture today," Thomas emphasized. Turning plants into legally protected monopolies will ultimately threaten food security in the global south.

New dimension of biopiracy

International agreements such as the Nagoya Protocol try to enable countries in the south to share in the added value created by the use and further development of their native plants. However, new technologies such as DNA sequencing and synthetic biology can now be used to circumvent such agreements, said Jim Thomas. These technologies allow biotech companies to determine and digitize the DNA of plants on site.

"What we are seeing today is large-scale genetic sequencing of as many organisms as possible. The data can then be disseminated via the internet to be reconstructed in laboratories in Germany, China or California," said Thomas. He has called for a general ban on property rights to living organisms, whether genetically modified or not.

Success in fighting off the teff patent

At least the teff flour case may soon be solved. In 2018, for the first time, a company successfully sued against the payment of license fees. The patent was subsequently declared null and void in the Netherlands.

However, because European Union patents are transferred to national patent systems in member states, the teff patent remained unchanged in some other EU countries, including Germany. Attorney Anton Horn heard about this from an Ethiopian student friend. He discussed with colleagues what could be done at a legal level. "And at some point I made the decision: I'll do it myself," Horn said.

He filed a nullity suit at the Federal Patent Court in Munich privately and at his own expense in the summer of 2019. The Dutch company holding the patent waived its German rights before the complaint reached the court.

It is likely that the teff flour patent will expire this summer in all other European countries. According to current entries in the register, the company has not paid any administrative fees for its patents since 2019, says Anton Horn. The lawyer knows that Ethiopians are very happy with these developments. He celebrated his success with colleagues with a plate of injera at an Ethiopian restaurant in Düsseldorf. "When the Ethiopian owner found out what we were celebrating, he refused to take our money," Horn says.

One would be forgiven for assuming that when reflecting on two decades of service at the University of Cape Town (UCT), Dr Marilet Sienaert, the Executive Director for Research, would list one of the numerous achievements of an illustrious career in the institution's research enterprise. But instead, it is largely those behind the success of the enterprise and the university that has made her time at UCT a memorable journey.

"What stands out for me, if I think back on my two decades here ... it really is about the people and the opportunity to build relations with people," said Sienaert.

TD 
	

"I've encountered incredible individuals from all sectors, from the researchers, on the [executive], in my own office, the security and cleaning staff ... I've learned so much from them in different ways and that I really value enormously."

At the end of 2019 Sienaert will retire, having undoubtedly made a massive impact on maintaining and furthering UCT's reputation as the top university in Africa and a leader in the global south. But for her, it's all about the people.

While there really are far too many to mention, she does acknowledge a few, particularly those who have influenced and mentored her.

The first are the deputy vice-chancellors (DVCs) under whom she has served since September 2000: Dr Sibusiso Sibisi; Professor Danie Visser, who was "very, very enabling" to work with and was so willing to share his knowledge and expertise; Professor Cheryl de la Rey, from whom Sienaert had learnt a lot about systems and processes; and UCT Vice-Chancellor (VC) Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng.

"She's shaken this place up in such a good way and re-energised us," said Sienaert of Phakeng, who began her UCT career as DVC for Research.

But the outgoing executive director reserves her highest praises for the research office's deputy director, Christina Pather.

"Truly, she is an amazing person ... She's very grounded, with impeccable integrity and just so good at what she does, with a very generous spirit," said Sienaert.

"I think of everyone at UCT that I've encountered, she probably stands out most."

How it started

Sienaert studied at the University of Pretoria where she completed her honours cum laude. In 1979 she made her first trip to UCT where she obtained her Master's in French Literature. She then completed a year at the University of Montpellier in France before heading to KwaZulu-Natal where she spent 23 years as an academic teaching literature, French and later Afrikaans.

She pursued her doctorate at the then University of Natal's Department of Afrikaans and Dutch, applying French literary theory to Dutch and early Afrikaans texts. After receiving her PhD, Sienaert began teaching poetry in the department where she delved into the works of Breyten Breytenbach, particularly on the interrelatedness of art and writing.

"I just had to learn very fast; it was a very steep learning curve for me."

The multilingual Sienaert continued her teaching career at the then University of Durban-Westville (now one of the University of KwaZulu-Natal's campuses) where she made the journey from junior lecturer to full professor. In 2000 the Sienaert family relocated to Cape Town.

She searched for work at all the universities in the Western Cape but there were no academic vacancies that spoke to her. Sienaert applied for any available job at UCT in an attempt to ensure that her children, who were of university-going age, studied at the "best university in the country". She was further enticed by the partial remission of fees for employees. She applied for an administrative job, which turned out to be the head of the grants office.

"And that's how it started," she said.

UCT Leadership Lekgotla and staff celebrate Dr Marilet Sienaert's two-decade career at the university.

But while Sienaert had experience in research, had written and received grants from the National Research Foundation (NRF) and had served on university research committees, she admits that the transition from teaching to administration was overwhelming at first.

"I just had to learn very fast; it was a very steep learning curve for me," she said, adding that the people around her were always enabling, friendly and helpful. Fast forward to her almost 20 years as executive director, that steep learning curve certainly paid off.

In her time as executive director, Sienaert has, among her lengthy list of achievements and contributions, led the Research Office, the Office of Research Integrity, the Directorate of Postgraduate Studies and Researcher Development, and the Postgraduate Centre and Funding Office. She has managed large, multi-year donor projects, published on higher education leadership and management, received and accepted several professional advisory support and broader research management community invitations, and served on at least 11 local and international committees, forums and communities of practice.

Importance of research

Sienaert's contribution to the research enterprise at UCT is undeniable. Equally undeniable is her appreciation of the importance of research.

According to Sienaert, virtually all UCT's research has impact locally, bettering the lives of South Africans whether in quick, tangible ways, through problem-solving interdisciplinary work, or at a policy-making level.

"At the same time, our researchers contextualise their research in the broader international context, ensuring that locally engaged work also has global relevance," she said, citing UCT scholars' contributions to work on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The problems identified in the 17 SDGs impact the world, are complex to solve, require an interdisciplinary approach and require input from the global south. And with UCT being the leading institution in Africa, and with the achievements of the university's researchers locally, UCT has become a sought-after partner, which in turn continues to improve its research profile.

Exemplifying this trajectory, UCT has been invited into high-profile research networks across the world, such as the International Alliance of Research Universities where UCT is the only African and global south member. Equally important are networks such as the African Research Universities Alliance and the Worldwide Universities Network.

"We can only ... assure the quality of our teaching, if [it] is informed by cutting-edge research."

UCT's research visibility also means it is seen as an entry point into the rest of Africa as a research collaborator. Additionally, and importantly for Sienaert, is the role of research in teaching.

"Remember, the function of a university is to grow the next generation of thought leaders, researchers [and] professionals.

"We can only ... assure the quality of our teaching, if [it] is informed by cutting-edge research," she said.

Therefore, Sienaert believes it is the responsibility of the university to its students to thrive in research so as to safeguard the quality of what they are taught.

Threats and hope

While Sienaert will leave the university's research enterprise in top shape, she admits that research across the country is, in fact, under threat due to "dramatic changes in the funding landscape".

Recent policy changes by the NRF have negatively affected UCT's national grants income and Sienaert fears that as a result our universities will be compromised as equal partners to global north counterparts. According to Sienaert, UCT and its national counterparts need to "hold our own to prevent helicopter science, where international researchers use us simply to mine our data, but then take the analyses off-shore and claim the findings as their own".

To help address this challenge, the Research Office is establishing a hub of expertise that can specifically assist with advanced proposal development to support large, collaborative and interdisciplinary project applications.

What gives her hope are the numbers of exceptional early career researchers that UCT has managed to produce in recent years, and that the research portfolio, under leadership of Professor Sue Harrison, is in good hands.

New opportunities

While Sienaert jokes that retirement is as certain as having to pay your taxes, she admits that she hasn't quite wrapped her head around it.

"It's taken me by surprise," she said, "I still feel so interested in everything that's going on and so energised by everything that I think ... I'll probably have a big shock waking up and all that adrenaline is gone."

But on the other hand, Sienaert believes it really is time for her to leave, to move on and to hand over the reins to new leadership and "some fresh thinking".

Sienaert is excited about the new opportunities, such as delving into projects at universities across the country, rediscovering her many interests, enjoying physical activities like walking and swimming, spending more time with her beloved dogs, returning to writing on her topics of interest, and travelling.

But at the top of her list is more time with the people she loves.

Sienaert is surrounded by what she calls a close network of women power: her sister, her favourite cousin and her sister-in-law, who all live nearby and are all around the same age. The long-serving UCT employee also has many friends from the university, four grandchildren, a daughter and her family in Cape Town, and a son and his family who will soon be relocating from the United States to Kenya, which will allow Sienaert to visit more often.

Then there are the long-time friends she made all those years back at the University of Montpellier whom she plans on visiting on an open invitation. Clearly, Sienaert's love for and love from people is something that has carried her through an illustrious career and will undoubtedly be a steadfast feature as she embarks on this new journey.

Colleagues pay tribute to Dr Marilet Sienaert

Vice-Chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng: "Saying congratulations to you on your retirement is bittersweet because it is people like you that we want to keep at the university."

Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Research Professor Sue Harrison: "UCT has been incredibly fortunate to have Marilet in the position that she has been. She leaves an amazing legacy and her contribution has been immense."

Dr Gaelle Ramon: "Marilet is an extremely supportive director ... she always had time for little people like me."

Former Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Research Professor Danie Visser: "It has been such a benefit working with you. Marilet, thank you for all that you've done for UCT."

Roshan Sonday: "With your guidance, support and care, it enabled me to step up ... What is remarkable is that as the leader of the office, you are always there, you always say, 'Can I help you? Do you need help?' ... You have been the driver, the driver of excellence and professionalism."

Last week, world leaders gathered in Nairobi for ICPD+25 to celebrate 25 years since the 1994 launch of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) , a convening space that has advocated for the wellbeing of women and girls around the world and invested in their efforts to promote equality and reduce gender-based violence.

This year's summit was a time for celebration and deep introspection on the state of women and girls' rights globally--of how far we have come and how much farther do we still need to go.

TD 
	

Twenty five years ago, feminists and women's rights advocates boldly campaigned around the idea of "personal being political" and argued that women's rights were in fact human rights and they could no longer be left out of global and political discussions.

The ICPD launch in 1994, and the Beijing Conference a year later, led to significant shifts in the way we viewed gender equality and a woman's right to control her body and have bodily autonomy. Those were the early days where we dreamed that another world was possible, where we dreamed of a feminist future.

Those were the days where our inclusive vision of gender equality was both passionately debated and revered, and where women globally were finally articulating the struggle for gender justice in new ways -- ways that recognized how colonialism and racism has shaped gender and economic issues between the Global North and the Global South.

But it's not 1994 anymore - and though much of the world has changed and grown, much has stayed the same. The rights of women and girls have risen to the world stage as an urgent global priority, one we must continue to address now - not in years to come.

The promises and commitments to gender equality made at ICPD and the Beijing Conference 25 years ago led to the creation of numerous laws, policies and treaties to protect women and girls' rights around the world. Where there were virtually no global commitments in the early 1990s, there are now more than 118 laws, treaties, and international declarations seeking to reduce or eliminate gender-based violence.

And, yet, while the mobilization and organization by many actors around the world has led to important advances in cultural norms and policy changes at the global level, violence against women and girls globally continues to be where we see power and patriarchy objectify, silence and undermine our quest for gender equality.

Since the 1990s, new challenges have emerged, including political and ideological attacks against gender equality, sexuality, reproductive freedom and self-determination. We are witness to a lack of political will to implement progressive laws and policies to, more worryingly, the reduced funding for women's rights organizations particularly in the Global South.

And though significant funding is being pledged and diverse coalitions are joining together to combat gender inequality, the Global South - where feminist movements have long led the fight for women's rights and against violence toward women and girls  is largely left out of the equation.  A far cry from the aspirations of the ICPD and Beijing Conferences, today we see fewer resources going to agendas framed bywomen's rights organizations forwomen's rights agendas.

But there is hope. Today, we see the rise and mobilizing strength of social movements in the face of the backlash -- often led by women, young people, LGBTQIA+ people, people with disabilities, indigenous people, ethnic and racial minorities, and many more. These growing movements continue to show their innovation and tenacity, embodying the true power of collective mobilization. Much of the world will no longer silently stand by as the rights of women and girls are questioned, reduced or taken away.

And at the Ford Foundation, we are taking a major stand to reshape our model -- to unlock resources and funding to put women and girls at the center of setting their own agendas and developing culturally appropriate solutions -- and we are urging the rest of the world to join us.

We are calling on leaders across the world - corporations and foundations, philanthropists, governments and individuals - to come together to actualize real change and commit more international financial resources towards ending violence against women and girls.

And we are advocating for women and girls of the Global South to have a seat at the table -- framing the problems they face and the solutions that they have. Because we know we can only achieve true transformation if those closest to the pain are able to reclaim their power and space.

We must hold our global community accountable for the promises made 25 years ago. With the 25 year anniversary of ICPD and Beijing upon us, we are advocating for a paradigm shift. At the Nairobi ICPD event, we pledged over $78 million dollars for the next three years towards eradicating gender-based violence (one of the pillars of the ICPD 25 agenda).

Together, the global leaders convened in Nairobi committed $8 billion to address violence against women and girls at the global stage. These resources will provide for a holistic feminist approach where women who have been rendered invisible in the past have a seat at the table. We will push for more resources and investments in women's rights organisations to advance an equality agenda that holds governments accountable because we know feminist movements ultimately drive lasting social change.

We must not allow commitments to be watered down and re-negotiated for decades to come -- we must push for a path that builds on what came before us. Real change will only occur when we begin to build relationships among emerging movements, established organizations, feminist funds, and leaders to enable more coordinated and mutually-supportive agendas.

Helping to protect and save the lives of women and girls across the globe can only achieved through collaboration between all societal communities. Every action we make together can help save not only one woman or girl's life, but fundamentally change our global community.

Huge investments in infrastructure are redefining global development, from China's Belt and Road Initiative to infrastructure development plans from the African Development Bank and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America.

TD 
	

The scramble to build infrastructure across Africa, Asia and Latin America is reconfiguring the economic geography of countries and regions. As we argue in our recent research, these initiatives enhance the connection between territories so that strategic industries and resources are easily plugged into global networks of production and trade.

But large infrastructure projects come at a significant economic cost and may not foster long-term economic growth and industrialisation. Their unintended social and environmental consequences can also be devastating.

Infrastructure networks, of transport, communication and energy, are expanding rapidly and increasingly extend across national borders. The Lamu Port - South Sudan - Ethiopia Transport Corridor in East Africa boasts plans for a deep-water port, international airports, highways, resorts and oil pipelines. Narendra Modi's "Make In India" initiative includes the establishment of five industrial corridors that connect India's most economically dynamic cities and "offer effective integration between industry and infrastructure."

Leaders with diverse political ideologies are embracing investment in infrastructure as a strategy for unlocking growth potential. According to Forbes the legacy of Philippines strongman president Rodrigo Duterte may be a "golden age of infrastructure" whose slogan is "Build, Build, Build!"

Across the Pacific and the political spectrum, Mexico's recently elected progressive president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) introduced an expansive national territorial development strategy in his 2018 campaign. Initially entitled AMLÓpolis, Obrador's vision is reflected in the ambitious Maya Train development corridor, a 1,525 kilometre railroad plan to serve both passengers and freight.

Such plans resurrect strategies that were exported to Latin America, Africa and Asia in the second half of the 20th century. These strategies included development corridors, new towns such as Brasilia and Chandigarh, and comprehensive river basin schemes modelled on the Tennessee Valley Authority. The primary objective in the 20th century was to foster integration within countries and reduce regional inequality by investing in poor areas. However, today's infrastructure-led development is geared towards attracting foreign investment and fostering export-oriented industrialisation.

A sea change in development policy

In the 1980s, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury - known collectively as the "Washington Consensus" - imposed a strict set of reforms on low- and middle-income countries. Countries were forced to discontinue planning strategies designed to reduce regional inequality. The objective of these neoliberal reforms was to "get the prices right" and allow market forces to determine the geographical distribution of goods, services and productive activities.

A series of economic crises in the Global South ensued, from Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1980s to East Asia and Russia in the 1990s. In response, the World Bank and the IMF introduced reforms meant to create institutions that could support markets in the 1990s.

These reforms enhanced transparency and strengthened private property rights, and they were designed to reduce the cost of doing business. The World Bank's imperative to "get the institutions right" culminated in the 2002 World Development Report which outlined the so-called "good governance agenda."

Neoliberalism's proponents hoped that by implementing painful reforms, countries would attract foreign direct investment and ultimately move up global value chains. In practice, restructuring had the opposite effect in many places. Industry was offshored from rich nations, but as the economist Richard Baldwin has shown, it agglomerated in a very small number of countries. Meanwhile, other countries in the Global South were forced to liberalise their markets, which exposed their domestic industry to highly productive global value chains and resulted in deindustrialisation.

Unintended consequences

The 2008 financial crisis served as an opportunity to redefine the role of the state. Under the leadership of chief economist Justin Yifu Lin, the World Bank changed course and asserted that governments shouldn't abandon economic geography to the whims of markets.

After a hiatus of nearly three decades in which development policy didn't focus on geography, the World Bank embraced planning as a way to correct the failures of markets and governance institutions. It argued that the absence from earlier rounds of neoliberal reform of deliberate plans to integrate countries with global markets was the missing ingredient that inhibited their success.

The overarching imperative of current development policy is to "get the territory right", and infrastructure-led development has superseded economic policies characterised by minimal government intervention and the good governance agenda. Integrating countries' economies with global value chains is the focus of the World Bank's most recent World Development Report.

Yet it remains to be seen if infrastructure-led development will offset the geographical disadvantages of places, such as Tanzania and Ethiopia, that have historically struggled to attract investment and integrate with global value chains.

Integration with the global economy won't automatically translate into local prosperity and social well-being. Overinvestment in hastily built infrastructure poses significant risks. The IMF recently sounded alarm bells over Tanzania's infrastructure spending spree, while the collapse of dams in Laos and Brazil demonstrate that the social and environmental impacts of large-scale infrastructure projects can be devastating.

While the jury is still out on the social, economic and environmental implications of infrastructure-led development, it looks set to reshape the Global South. It's vital to continue to track its impacts and unintended consequences.

"Across the world, citizens who want their governments to implement policies to reduce inequalities, address climate change and looming ecological disaster, provide better public services and amenities, ensure social protection, generate quality employment and so on, are always confronted with one question: where is the money? We are constantly told that governments cannot afford the necessary expenditure; that running fiscal deficits will lead to financial chaos and crisis; and that raising taxes will simply drive away investment. But this is not just misleading; it is simply wrong. Governments are constrained in their resources because they tolerate widespread tax evasion and avoidance. " - Professor Jayati Ghosh, Jawaharlal Nehru University

This AfricaFocus Bulletin contains excerpts from a new report from Christian Aid and allied organizations, calling for a comprehensive rights-based definition of illicit financial flows, including both illegal tax evasion and abusive tax avoidance that uses biased laws and gray-area loopholes to minimize the taxes paid by corporations and the ultra-rich. The report provides a clear argument, supplemented by case studies from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The excerpts below include cases of a Irish tax treaty with Ghana and a major Canadian mining company in Zambia, documenting how legal avenues are structured to deprive countries of needed revenue.

This answer to "where is the money" for public needs applies worldwide, but is particularly relevant on the African continent, where tax revenues are the lowest and the needs are the greatest. As the report notes, African civil society and inter-governmental organizations such as the UN Economic Commission for Africa have taken the lead on pressing this case in both national and international arenas. This latest report is a marker of how the common-sense answer is gaining ground internationally as well.

Also included in the AfricaFocus Bulletin is an extensive and well- crafted infographic from the Tax Justice Network making the same case.

Trapped in Illicit Finance: How abusive tax and trade practices harm human rights

September 2019

Christian Aid

[Excerpts only. For full text, including figures and footnotes, visit https://www.christianaid.org.uk/resources/about-us/trapped-illicit-finance-report]

Executive summary

On September 26, 2019, world leaders [gathered] at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, for high-level talks on finance for development. One burning question on the agenda is the financial chasm facing the SDGs.

Adopted by the UNGA in 2015, the 17 goals offer a roadmap for ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all, by 2030. But with little over a decade to go, vast amounts of public and private finance still need to be found if they are to be realised within the timeframe. The funding gap for delivering the goals from private sector sources alone is estimated at $2.5tn.

In this report, Christian Aid and our partners propose a simple solution for plugging some of this funding gap: we must stop tolerating the abusive, unethical, immoral illicit financial flows (IFFs) that rob the poor to enrich the wealthy.

Our estimates show that IFFs cause tax losses of $416bn in the global South. This is money that could enable governments to deliver much-needed public services, and bring us closer to a world where all experience dignity, equality and justice. As eminent economist Professor Jayati Ghosh stated in the report foreword: 'Illicit financial flows - both illegal and legal - may be the major constraint to development and achieving human rights today'.

World leaders have previously committed to fight IFFs. At the Third International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD) in 2015, participants agreed to 'substantially reduce illicit financial flows by 2030, with a view to eventually eliminating them'. A similar commitment was made when the UN 2030 Agenda was agreed.

However - and this is the crucial point - what has been missing until now has been a robust definition of IFFs.

Governments of the global North insist on a legalistic definition that would only capture flows of money universally accepted as being illegal, eg, money laundering or corruption. However, we and many of our partners in the global South believe what matters is not whether flows of money or tax practices are legal, but whether they are abusive, harmful or limit governments' ability to deliver on their human rights obligations. ...

That's why Christian Aid is calling for the debate around IFFs to shift towards a rights-based one. We want the definition of IFFs broadened to refer to 'cross-border flows of money that are either illegal or abusive of laws in their origin, or during their movement or use'. It is not about whether it's illegal, but immoral.

Christian Aid also believes the UN should establish structures to define IFFs based on this rights-based definition. This would require the UN to play a more prominent role in setting the rules and conventions for taxing TNCs, and to expedite international tax cooperation by establishing a UN tax body to decide on taxing rules.

Addressing IFFs is not just about funding the SDGs - important as this is. It is also about addressing the systemic issues that continue to undermine poor countries' abilities to raise revenue and move beyond a reliance on aid. In that respect it is a stand- alone process: one that is not just tied to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but which is grounded in justice and equity.

Our estimates show that illicit financial flows strip poorer nations of revenue losses to the tune of $416bn per year.

This is through practices including tax abuses and avoidance by TNCs and wealthy individuals, and tax losses due to tax evasion arising from companies who deliberately misprice goods and commodities to minimise tax liability.

Introduction: Illicit financial flows are a violation of human rights

An exact definition of IFFs has not been agreed internationally; but for the purposes of this report, the term can be defined simply as money that leaves countries where it should in fact be contributing to development efforts and the achievement of human rights. In other words, IFFs may be defined as 'flows of money that are either illegal or abusive of laws in their origin, or during their movement or use'.

These include practices such as tax abuse, abusive tax incentives, abusive use of bilateral and multilateral trade treaties, misuse of double tax treaties, odious debt, abusive use of mutual arbitration procedures, harmful tax practices, unjust investment agreements, money laundering, trade mis-invoicing, abusive transfer pricing, illicit money transfers, crime, bribery, the illicit drugs trade, corruption and the 'offshore' trust industry.

The issue is ultimately about the power of who makes the rules and norms in the global economy regarding these issues. For too long, they have been decided in clubs of countries comprising mainly of, or led by, the global North such as the G7 or the G20, or indeed the OECD that does not take the legitimate interests of countries in the global South adequately into consideration.

Tackling IFFs is not a new concern. For decades, the issue has been discussed either as capital flight or in terms of tax avoidance; and more recently, to understand the activities of multinational enterprises,and in terms of wealth held offshore. The novelty is grouping these practices together within an internationally agreed definition of IFFs, along with transnational crime and corrupt activities.

Combining these practices presents us with a fuller, more frightening picture of how today's global financial system is centred on secrecy jurisdictions and corporate tax havens that facilitate these activities, as well as corruption and transnational organised crime. There is no way to achieve the ambitious 2030 Agenda and the SDGs without stopping the bleeding of hundreds of billions of dollars in IFFs.

The momentum for tackling IFFs is coming from governments, civil society and regional bodies from the global South such as the African Union that have long highlighted the damage caused by IFFs. Notably, in 2015 a coalition of African organisations launched a civil society campaign called Stop the Bleeding in a bid to highlight the billions of dollars illicitly flowing out of Africa each year. Many African governments, and the Group of 77 of countries in the global South in the UNGA, raise the issue of IFFs in their interventions.

The 7th annual Pan Africa Conference on Illicit Financial flows and Taxation, held in Nairobi on October 1-3, 2019, sponsored by the Tax Justice Network-Africa and a wide range of other civil society and inter-governmental institutions, focused on the challenge of taxing digital enterprises, which require new technologies to track and tax profits across borders.

If the definition of IFFs in the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs (an initial draft definition is expected by the end of 2019) includes only activities that are already illegal - such as corruption, crime and tax evasion - there will be no mandate from the 2030 Agenda to tackle tax abuses that far outweigh these other activities in terms of revenues lost from countries in the global South. there is a risk that, under the guise of 'licit' financial flows via tax havens, this will only exacerbate the problem.

...

Meanwhile, the secretariat of the UN Financing for Sustainable Development Office has analysed the situation and concluded that there is a 'grey zone' in which the dividing line between legal and illegal financial flows is blurred due to a lack of resources, a lack of access to data and discrepancies between how data are reported to tax authorities, the media, and shareholders in private databases.

In this report, we highlight what goes on in this grey zone and propose the use of principles derived from international human rights law to understand practices that constitute harmful activities even though they may not be illegal in all jurisdictions where a TNC has operations; where a transaction is taking place, in terms of trade mispricing issues; or where wealth is held offshore. The problem lies in the mismatches, misunderstandings and lack of commonly agreed principles between the global North and the global South in terms of international economic governance that give rise to IFFs, as seen in Figure 1.

The definition of IFFs is being debated both within international development frameworks and in human rights monitoring bodies. It is an important definition, as it will determine the mandates at the global level to monitor the financial system, national efforts to combat IFFs in the Global South, and international development cooperation as well as south-south cooperation. ...

The first definition, which we call 'legalistic', is what is also often described as a narrow definition of IFFs, used by a number of international organisations, including the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD and UNODC. The OECD refers to 'a set of methods and practices aimed at transferring financial capital out of a country in contravention of national or international laws'.

The second definition is what we would call 'normative': it defines IFFs in terms of a normative problem in how laws, rules and regulations are actually established, rather than focusing merely on the letter of the law. ... What is considered 'illegitimate' is discussed through case study evidence and covers practices such as corrupt government deals, tax abuse, abusive tax incentives and other concerns that further expand the focus of the discussion on IFFs.

The third definition builds on the first and second definitions, as it tries to define a normative framework around what should be considered 'illegitimate'. ...

This definition is supported mainly by UNCTAD, which has analysed IFFs in terms of their economic and development losses. Under this definition, UNCTAD considers that 'the key criterion used is whether such tax-motivated IFFs are justified from an economic point of view'. If considerable tax losses are associated with IFFs, UNCTAD considers that these serve to undermine development outcomes that require greater fiscal capabilities.

...

Finally, the fourth definition - as proposed by this report - also builds on the first and second definitions, but views the issue through a rights-based lens. The definition therefore includes all aspects of tax abuse and tax avoidance, as these have a significant impact on the availability of public resources for realising human rights and upholding the rule of law. ...

[The remainder of the Christian Aid report includes a variety of case studies, including in African countries. Excerpted below are two cases, one in Ghana and the other in Zambia.]

Part one: Tax abuses by transnational corporations

TNCs are essentially companies that operate in multiple countries and autonomous jurisdictions. As these countries and territories have different (at times conflicting) tax and financial laws, the international tax system is a patchwork with loopholes and mismatches that companies (and the wealthy individuals who own them) can exploit to pay less tax - either legally (albeit often through abusive practices) or illegally, in the hope that they will not get caught due to the high degree of secrecy and complexity that characterises the international financial system.

A TNC is taxed separately for each of its legal entities in each territory in which it operates. Thus, if a TNC has 200 different subsidiaries and affiliates, each one of them must file its own tax return. This separate treatment of the different legal entities of TNCs is set out in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, even though - for strategic purposes, and in the eyes of shareholders who seek to profit from the activities of the entire group, rather than those of its individual parts - the company is essentially a single entity.These separate entities are assumed to be trading at 'arm's length' - that is, as if they were unrelated parties - under the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

Meanwhile, human rights norms - such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and various laws on mandatory human rights due diligence in Europe - establish that companies should be treated as single entities in light of their human rights obligations for their entire global operations, including their supply chains. Corporate accountability efforts also point in this direction, including the EU Non- financial Reporting Directive, the US Dodd- Frank Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act. The tax and human rights angle on treating corporates as single strategic entities has thus far had little impact on the cross-border tax treatment of TNCs; but it is logical to treat companies as single taxable entities with respect to international human rights norms.

TNCs - for good reason - pool some of their resources in shared intra-group functions, such as financing, procurement, sales, human resources, brands, patents and management services, which are held in a specific subsidiary or subsidiaries and sold on to other subsidiaries as corporate services. If these 'transfer prices' are established at abusively low or high levels, they can be used for 'profit shifting', which often aims to reduce profits in high-tax countries and jurisdictions and report profits from such collective functions in low-tax countries and jurisdictions. TNCs may seek to maximise their profits (often post-tax profits rather than pre-tax profits) at a global level by routing trade, financing and investment through countries and jurisdictions that present tax advantages.

This type of behaviour is the focus of the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, which aimed to end such practices, but has largely failed to do so due to a lack of agreement on how to tax TNCs globally. At present, the UN only has an expert committee on international tax matters, whose members are restricted to commenting on such matters in their expert capacity as individuals, rather than proposing plans for new rules and regulations on the taxation of TNCs. Countries in the global South have called for the establishment of a UN-based tax commission (or a UN tax body) to negotiate how best to tax TNCs and improve transparency and accountability in international tax matters.

The taxation of cross-border transactions such as interest, royalty, dividend and other intra-firm payments is often governed by double tax agreements (DTAs), such as the Ireland-Ghana DTA and the Mauritius-India DTA discussed on the next few pages. The applicable tax rates are often set at ever-lower levels in the hope that this will increase investment, despite the lack of evidence to support this view. ...

Irish double tax agreement threatens revenue losses in Ghana

By Mike Lewis

This case study tells a political story rather than a technical one. It shows how some governments are continuing to ignore new international anti-avoidance standards, and the advice of their own civil servants, in pursuing tax agreements that may create new avenues for tax avoidance and deprive countries in the global South of taxing rights.

DTAs can resolve tax dilemmas for companies and citizens living and working between two countries, or investing in one country's economy from another. If they are incautiously or exploitatively drafted, however, DTAs can unfairly deprive countries in the global South of taxing rights that are vital to reduce aid dependency, protect their citizens' rights and develop their economies. They can also open up new loopholes for profit shifting and other forms of cross- border tax avoidance. In 2014, usually conservative IMF tax policy staff advised that 'developing countries...would be well advised to sign treaties only with considerable caution'.

Ireland is expanding its network of DTAs. As this already encompasses numerous agreements with developed economies, Ireland is now particularly focused on signing new treaties with emerging economies. Of eight treaties currently awaiting final signature and/or ratification, five are with countries in the global South. As part of its new Africa strategy launched in 2011, Ireland targeted four emerging African economies for new DTAs, including Ghana.

Ghana is the lowest-income of Ireland's current prospective DTA partners. A booming middle-income economy, it is also a vulnerable one which is still a (small) recipient of Irish aid. Over one in 20 Ghanaian children still die before their fifth birthday; and despite major improvements, almost 4 million Ghanaian children still live below the poverty line.Ghana's tax revenues also remain vulnerable: Ghana collects only around 16% of its GDP in tax revenues, compared to 25-30% for most European economies.

Although, from Ireland's perspective, Ghana may be a relatively small investment and trading partner, the new Ireland-Ghana DTA matters greatly to Ghana, because according to Ghanaian statistics, since 2012 Ireland has become Ghana's largest source of FDI. By 2016 (the most recent year for which Ghanaian-reported FDI data are available), Irish FDI constituted one-third of Ghana's entire reported FDI stock.Limiting Ghana's taxing rights over income, profits and economic activity between Ireland and Ghana may thus have a significant impact on Ghanaian tax revenues.

Both parties signed the DTA in February 2018. Although approved by Ireland's Parliament in October 2018, it still requires approval and ratification by the Ghanaian Parliament, meaning that the DTA's entry into force now rests on whether Ghanaian institutions find it abusive or harmful, and request further changes to the treaty.

Imbalances of the Ghana-Ireland DTA

* The DTA will cut Ghanaian withholding tax on royalties to Ireland from the domestic 15% rate to 8%, and on (closely related) technical services fees from 20% to 10%. ...

* The DTA will deny Ghana the right to tax capital gains from the sale of assets in its territory (other than immovable property), if the sale is executed through the offshore sale of shares in an Irish holding company. This contradicts the recommendations of both the IMF and the UN Tax Committee.Since Ireland appears, according to Ghanaian statistics, to be the largest single source of direct investment in Ghana's economy, this provision could potentially deprive Ghana of very large tax revenues when valuable Ghanaian assets change hands.

* The DTA lacks any of the anti-avoidance provisions which OECD member states, including Ireland, agreed in 2015 were necessary to provide 'the minimum level of protection against treaty abuse'. It is therefore fully non-compliant with the OECD's BEPS project against tax avoidance and profit shifting, which Ireland has repeatedly pledged to implement in full. ...

These features arguably contradict the Irish government's own commitments in Ireland's international tax strategy: to support 'improvements in domestic resource mobilisation [tax revenues] in partner [developing] countries', including through Ireland's own domestic tax policies;and to fully implement the OECD's BEPS project to prevent corporate tax avoidance.

...

Part two: Lost tax due to trade mispricing and trade mis-invoicing

International trade is not what it seems. Trade mispricing has become a multibillion-dollar industry, in which trade handling companies identify the least costly way to make a paper trail of payments for goods, which often has nothing to do with their physical movement. Unrelated importers and exporters utilise offshore tax havens to route trade on paper to reduce the taxes paid on border transactions, as they provide secrecy for practices such as double invoicing and mis-invoicing - sub-categories of the umbrella term 'trade mispricing'.

When we talk about imports and exports, many think that goods flow from one country to another relatively directly; and this is what is shown in the international trade data maintained by the UN Comtrade database and the IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS). There are some legitimate discrepancies in the import value reported for the same set of imports in the receiving country and the export value in the exporting country that relate to shipments via transit countries, regarding how goods are declared in value ('Free on Board' is often used, but not by all countries).

The volumes of potential trade mispricing are absolutely eye- watering. A representative sample of 30 African countries from 1970 to 2015 revealed that these countries lost a combined $1.4tn through capital flight over the 46-year period; including interest earnings lost on capital flight brought the cumulative amount to $1.8tn.The average outflow from Africa for the years 2010 to 15 was estimated at $63bn under this methodology, lost mainly from oil-rich African nations. ...

The best estimates of tax losses due to trade mispricing come from GFI, which has estimated that trade mispricing (encompassing both illicit outflows and illicit inflows) in 2015 caused losses of $940bn, based on the UN Comtrade data, while higher IMF DOTS would show a loss of $1,690bn.Both of these figures, attempt to estimate mismatches between the declared import price and the export price in the same pair of countries or vice versa.

Zambia's copper sector mispricing abuses

By Prof Attiya Waris

First Quantum Minerals (FQM) is Zambia's largest mining company and largest single taxpayer, and has been lauded as contributing more than one-third of the Zambian government's income.The 2015/2016 Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) data reveals that the Kansanshi mine provided 22% of tax revenue, while 7% was provided by another subsidiary. The main types of taxes that FQM pays in Zambia are mineral royalties, followed by other types of taxes. It is evident that the collection of mineral royalties is relatively simple; the debate thus centres on the declaration of correct production volumes and payments to governments, including in EITI reporting.

Kansanshi Mining PLC, a subsidiary of Canadian mining and metals company First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FQM)

FQM is listed on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, and operates mining projects globally. It has a number of local affiliates in Zambia, all with separate accounts. The available data reveals discrepancies between the information regarding FQM registered with the Zambian companies registry and that held in the Orbis database. For instance, while cover investments is shown to have been incorporated in Zambia in one database search for FQM and Operations Ltd, in the Orbis database there is no record of cover investments.

The Zambian Revenue Authority is reportedly accessing information from Orbis and other proprietary company information databases in order to improve its audits.The FQM data sheet, on the other hand, indicates that the company is incorporated in Ireland. These discrepancies make tax audits and tax assessments more difficult in the absence of full country-by-country reporting under the OECD initiative, due to the lack of information exchange with other revenue authorities. The quickest way to facilitate full country-by-country reporting would be to make the filings mandated by the OECD public and available to all, including the revenue authorities of countries in the global South.

FQM and its subsidiaries in Zambia are subject to various taxes, from employee income taxes to VAT, mineral royalties and corporate taxes, among others. However, the EITI disclosure for the year 2016 is not sub-divided by the types of taxes paid, so sensitive tax information - such as corporate income tax payments per country of operation - is unavailable.From the corporate structure of FQM, depicted in Figure 8, we can see that its Zambian operations involve offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and Ireland.

The current lack of transparency affords abundant opportunities for transfer pricing abuses. According to a claim before the Lusaka High Court, between 2007 and 2014, FQM directors ordered over $2.3bn of Kansanshi profits to be borrowed to FQM Finance Limited, which performs treasury functions for the group.FQM Finance then alledgedly started investing these funds from the Kansanshi mine to grow the group without the consent of the government- owned local minority shareholder, ZCCM-IH. According to sources close to ZCCM-IH, its claim includes $228m in interest on the $2.3bn, as well as a further 20% of the principal amount ($570m). FQM and the Kansanshi Mining PLC state that they are firmly of the view that the allegations are untrue. The proceedings are still underway in the Lusaka High Court as of August 2019.

...

[another case] involving FQM was revealed in March 2018, when FQM received an $8bn charge relating to unpaid import duties arising from misdeclarations.The assessment concerned the under-declaration and non-declaration of import duties on capital items, consumables and spare parts for use at the Sentinel mine from January 2013 to December 2017.Following a five- year tax investigation, the losses were calculated at $540m, which was found to amount to smuggling in the form of misdeclared customs duties. In the case of smuggling charges, criminal fines may be imposed.

The fine sought to be imposed on FQM has been duly calculated at $2.1bn, as smuggling is punishable by a threefold fine in addition to the assessed amount, with a further late payment charge of $5.7bn, according to the company's own disclosure. FQM refuted the assessment. In July 2019 a settlement was reached for an undisclosed amount....

If you look at a globe, you'll see that the Southern Hemisphere is bluer than the Northern Hemisphere. A huge 80% of it is ocean compared to 60% of the North.

The Southern Ocean is the only ocean in which waves circulate without encountering intervening landmasses. It's gargantuan in size and ferocity. The roaring, furious, and screaming latitudes are daunting to maritime traffic.

TD 
	

The Antarctic Convergence - where icy currents meet warmer sub-Antarctic waters - supports an abundance of marine life. There's no northern equivalent to this phenomenon. But, like the icebound continent itself, no humans live there.

Because it uniquely flows into the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, the Southern Ocean opens up possibilities for tracking the intersecting currents and itineraries that compose the global South. As do writers and artists, we're calling for the global South to be thought of alongside the Southern Ocean, what we call the oceanic South.

The global South makes you think mostly of an unequal present but the oceanic South brings to the fore pasts of maritime imperialism, as well as what the future might bring. It draws together the dispersed landmasses of the settler South, the decolonised and still colonised countries of the Southern Hemisphere, the "sea of islands" comprising Indigenous Oceania, and the frozen continent of Antarctica.

A research group, that we are a part of, based at the University of the Witwatersrand, Oceanic Humanities for the Global South has turned its attention to cultural representations of the ocean by exploring literature and the arts across different scales of time and place. This includes the Southern Ocean.

Reviewing the literature

Many writers and artists have represented the Southern Ocean in ways that layer possible futures over diverse pasts - illuminating the links between them.

Two examples we discussed in a recent paper are Witi Ihaemera's The Whale Rider from Aotearoa New Zealand and Zakes Mda's The Whale Caller from South Africa.

Both novels register the catastrophic slaughter of whales that took place during roughly the same period as European colonialism. Both explore the interrelationship between genocidal and extractive projects and how humans and whales interlock as they journey together through the southern seas.

This is the term that Ihimaera uses to describe "the knowledge of whalespeaking" that the ancients once had. It was also this knowledge and with which the Maori ancestor Paikea asked a whale to carry him to the land that lay far to the south.

The novel shows how the interlocking of land inhabitants and ocean inhabitants that articulates the origin story of Aotearoa is sundered when the whalekilling begins.

Mda's novel The Whale Caller sketches out similarly intersecting itineraries of land and ocean inhabitants from the vantage point of the southern tip of Africa. The Whale Caller had learned the songs of migrating whales during his own peregrinations in which he

spent many years walking westwards along the coast of the Indian Ocean, until he reached the point where the two oceans met, and then proceeded northwards along the Atlantic Ocean coast.

The Whale Caller surmises that - like the Australasians he has read about - the indigenous inhabitants of these African shores had feasted on stranded whales and that their expressions of gratitude for the bounty delivered by the sea included also mourning for the loss of companion species.

Other literature that's been explored includes poetry by South African-born poet and novelist Yvette Christiansë. She links the Indian and Atlantic Oceans by following "Liberated Africans" from Mozambique to St Helena. This one of the forgotten afterlives of slavery, centred in the South.

The journeys of books

The Oceanic Humanities for the Global South is also taking into account the entire hydrological cycle. This links evaporation from the surrounding oceans to rainfall on the watershed of the Witwatersrand - ridge of white waters in Gauteng. Isabel Hofmeyr, a Professor of African Literature at the University of the Witwatersrand and New York University, has proposed the rubric "hydrocolonialism" to link sea and land, empire and environment.

In provisional notes on the topic she discusses hydrocolonial book history and sets out what can be learnt from tracing books on their oceanic journeys.

The Oceanic Humanities for the global South team is involved in a range of other research too. The subjects include undertaking a cultural history of seaweed harvesters, abalone poachers, black whalers and other underwater workers. Members of the team are also exploring representations of water spirits in local literature and culture and tracing links between black aesthetics and the deep ocean.

Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote donated $20 million to help change narratives about Africa in the world. The donation was made to The Africa Center in New York, towards reversing the trend of negative news on Africa. Funding is the greatest challenge for media startups in the Global South, and there is need for local and international donors to invest in sustaining and growing media organisations in their work.

Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote donated $20 million to The Africa Center based in New York, with the aim of reversing the trend of negative perception of Africa across the world. Dangote's donation was made through the Aliko Dangote Foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supported Dangote's vision by announcing a new $5 million grant at the Future Africa Forum.

TD 
	

According to the press release, "The Gates Foundation grant is directed to the Center's capital campaign and for the development of its policy initiatives".

The Africa Center is a non-profit institution focused on challenging historical stereotypes around the African continent and a hub for creating an intersection of African policy, business, and culture and recreating narratives about Africa's economic and cultural significance today and into the future.

While this grant would play a major role, it is not yet certain if it would support African based digital media outlets, which also concern themselves with correcting the negative perception of Africa by the outside world, and addressing historical revisionism.

Dangote said, "the Africa Center is showcasing Africa in a contemporary, multifaceted manner as a center of innovation, growth, and limitless potential, which makes this project extremely important".

The main hall at The Africa Center was named the Aliko Dangote Hall. "There is an opportunity to establish new narratives about Africa today, with its unrivaled mix of people, ideas, and resources, which are both its greatest strength and the basis for its tremendous, untapped promise. The connections The Africa Center will make between Africa, and the United States, and the rest of the world, including members of the Diaspora, are needed more now than ever before," Dangote said.

Funding: the greatest challenge for media startups in Global South

A new report published this year from Columbia University by lecturer Anya Schiffrin called "Fighting for Survival: Media Startups in the Global South" revealed that funding is the greatest challenge for media startups in Global South. The report focused on journalists exposing corruption and holding power to account in the global south, and the media practitioners interviewed say financing their operations is the biggest challenge, much bigger even than physical safety or political risk. The report revealed that for many of the organisations interviewed, supporting independent journalism with revenue from readers and advertisers does not work as a sustainable business model, thus donor funding is needed to support the important work.

Schiffrin interviewed dozens of media startups in the global south over time, and concluded that many media startup organisations are not financially viable without donor support. The report suggested that international donors should invest in sustaining and growing these organisations in their work of advocating for equality, fighting corruption, shedding light on stories of abuse of power that otherwise would go unreported.

Organisations such as This Is Africa which are currently facing funding issues continue doing the important work of telling Africa's stories by Africans. More donor funding however seems to be given to organisations based outside Africa, while organisations on the continent struggle to remain sustainable. Journalists and startups need donors to step in to help to facilitate their work in various ways.

HD 	It's Wrong to Cut and Paste Global North Policies Onto Africa's Music Industries

Music streaming services have generated years of consistent revenue growth for rights holders in developed countries, making them the dominant source of revenue for recordings worldwide.

Global music companies and digital services are expanding. Music streaming firms such as Spotify and Apple Music are increasingly global in nature. On top of this, major record labels and publishers are investing more resources in the African market.

TD 
	

While critical debates continue around fairness and who will reap the benefits, investors are eager for more growth.

It's therefore no surprise that digital music in African countries has been a topic at global music industries conferences. Take the MIDEM African Forum which aims to "assist with the development and internationalisation of the African music markets" through collaboration with foreign experts.

Meanwhile, the development perspective of the United Nations reflects a creative economy policy approach that acknowledges that the "least-developed countries" are inadequately prepared to reap the benefits of digitalisation.

It's indeed a laudable aim to assist less developed countries to modernise their music industries. But, as I outline in a book chapter, a comparative approach is well-intentioned, but naive. That's because the assumption that foreign business models will apply to cultural industries in the Global South is simply wrong.

The notion that production, distribution, and consumption of music ought to be the same in Monrovia as in Milwaukee or Milan ignores a very beautiful thing about popular music: it is heterogeneous.

Lessons in what's possible

I spent 2010-2013 living in Monrovia, Liberia, trying to build local capacity in the music industry as an expatriate worker. In 2014, I was hired by the World Bank to draft recommendations on the Liberian music industries for possible inclusion in the country's private sector development strategy. The approach I took was to conduct a gap analysis.

I compared the value chain of the US music market with Liberia's. The recommendations I came up with centred around educating musicians on copyright, and improving infrastructure and standards through training and investment from abroad. Similar interventions have been recommended more recently by MIDEM.

But in my rush to impose definitions of what Liberia's music industries should be, I neglected to acknowledge what was already working.

People make, distribute, and consume music differently in Liberia. While living in the country from 2010 to 2013 I would hear songs by local musicians like Nasseman, Sweetz, Takun J, David Mell and Lady Skeet in dance clubs and taxis. And I would see their videos on screens in restaurants and bars.

But I wouldn't find their music for sale alongside foreign albums and DVDs in the wheelbarrows and displays of Liberian street vendors. Nevertheless, if I asked people to play me their favourite Liberian song, they'd do so immediately - on their cell phone.

The average Liberian was buying music from telechargeurs. These are street vendors who offer to transfer unlicensed files of song recordings onto cell phones. The consumer pays for the song in this informal scenario, but the composer and performers are not compensated.

This method of consuming music was normalised and not widely understood as infringement. Liberia's first copyright law was only passed in 1996, and until a recent update in 2016 digital copyright was not even covered.

Like many countries in the Global South, Liberia had only one market for recorded media including music: the informal one. Informal vendors were completely ignored in my research and report, as I failed to appreciate them for what they were: Liberia's retailers and music curators.

Like many other outsiders, I saw informal vendors as an obstacle to creating legitimate infrastructure. I often would buy unlicensed DVDs myself from vendors and knew they were the only way to access content. But I failed to envision a possible future where these entrepreneurs were part of the path towards formal markets.

Embracing the informal

It is my hope that future attempts to create formal media markets in the Global South will not make the same mistake that I did.

Sadly, it seems that rather than looking towards ways to formalise existing markets, Liberia is choosing the path of demonising media entrepreneurs as pirates. This could soon resemble the approach of Ghana, which has recently deployed crackdown efforts against street vendors again.

This adversarial perspective is unnecessary and detrimental.

In Liberia, informal vendors could be legitimised and licensed in the interim while it develops formal systems. These informal vendors are the best candidates to become the formal workforce. As Nollywood's global distribution has shown, informal markets can create efficient and economically sustainable media industries.

The criminalising of informal vendors is just one example of how a cultural economy in a country like Liberia might suffer from paying more attention to replicating what other countries have, rather than building on what is working well at home. Journalist Cherie Hu has noted that "trying to copy-and-paste old business models that worked in incumbent markets into newer ones simply won't work".

But this perspective is usually not seen outside of academic research.

It is my hope that others can learn from my regrets about the approach I took in 2014. Well-intentioned calls for a global music development framework could consider the informal markets as guides, not obstacles. Creative production and distribution need to be researched while taking into account that informal markets are often the only media market in least-developed countries.

HD 	How NGOs in Rich Countries Control Their Counterparts in Poor Countries..and Why They Refuse to Resolve It

Many NGOs around the world are fighting inequality between the rich and the poor, between the policies that make rich countries richer, and poor countries poorer. So while Civil Society Organizations claim to be equal and are are fighting together to secure space for engagement and to work, the bigger NGOs should also ask themselves why they are unwilling to let others who are less resourced take up the space where their voice can be heard. Why are they unwilling to fight policies that keep rich NGOs richer?

Here are some numbers to show you why this is a battle no Global NGOs is willing to take on.

TD 
	

2.1%

The total amount of global funding that goes directly to civil society in the Global South. The remaining 97.9% is given directly to International Civil Society Organizations, who then sub contract 87% of the project delivery to Civil Society in the Global South to deliver on projects.

This is according to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and analysis based on working statistics from the OECD Data on allocation of funds to Civil Society and the DAC and CRS Code list.

Despite attempts by Southern Civil Society Organizations to reverse this trend, Northern NGOs have had the standard response for the past ten years "We acknowledge its a problem, but its more complicated than you think." (Read the latest debate here during the Humanitarian Summit in 2016.)

Attempts to change for Humanitarian NGOs under the Grand Bargain campaign, has hit a deadlock because of very curious reason- disagreement on who is "local". These goes to demonstrate just how embedded the INGOs are with their Governments.in one classic study, it was found that "while Syrian humanitarian actors were responsible for delivering 75% of the humanitarian assistance in 2014, they received only 0.3% of the direct and 9.3% of the indirect cash funding available for the overall Syria response. Despite their crucial role, Syrian NGO's struggled to get their most basic costs covered in the sub-contracting and partnership agreements they have with international agencies. While international actors are all committed to transparency, 30% of the known funding remains unknown in terms of which humanitarian actor actually received the funding." (Read Full study here)

$21,500

The average annual Salary of a Chief Executive from the Global South. This is equivalent to the average salary of a Junior Project Officer from any civil society Organization from the Europe or North America (including those working in the Global South) and is 11.6 times less than the average salary of a Chief Executive of the Civil Society in the North.

This is according to data derived from IRS Returns of NGOs in the US (Charity Navigator), the Report of the Charity Pay Study by the Third Sector , UK, studies in pay gap between local and international staff by Massey University, studies by Science Direct, Pay studies in developing countries such as Kenya, and analysis of advertised salaries for locals and international staff posted on the UN information and recruitment website Relief Web.

Chief Executives of Southern Civil Society that are considered International in Scope earn just slightly over $35,000 in annual pay-with one exception, BRAC. BRAC is an exception in that while it is technically a Southern NGO, it is considered the largest NGO in the world, and the most well funded, with a vast catalogue of social enterprises, government of Bangladesh Funding and Foreign Government grants for its mainly MDG-type development agenda.

According to a study by Global to Local "The issue of large salary differences between local and international NGOs/agencies 22 have a direct negative impact on capacity and capacity building for local organisations - not least when it comes to crucial staff positions such as project and finance staff. Continuously building the capacity of their staff, just to see them leave for better-paid positions with INGO's and UN agencies (their so-called partners) is an uphill battle for local actors. One that continues to keep them locked into an 'underdog' position vis-à-vis international actors. This kind of continuous "brain drain" is global."

90%

Percentage of local staff out of the total humanitarian workers in Syria who die in line of duty, according to a study mainly. This is mainly because the poor pay means local actors cannot afford the security measures needed to keep them safe, but also because being their community they tend to be closer to the conflict and respond with greater passion because International NGO Staff are either not in the field, or restrict their movements to security zones in conflict countries.This trend is noted in several other conflict areas around the world

99.1%

These studies also show that a record 99.1 % of NGOs in the Global South (that is nearly all of them) are working on a sub-grant basis by the International NGOs, meaning they effectively do not have an agenda of their own and must conform to what is known in the Development Sector as "Shifts in Donor Interests". Hence, less than 10% of local NGOs are truly local. The negative impact of this on legitimacy, independence and objectivity of local Civil Society Organizations have been analyzed and documented. When asked why they do not give directly to local NGOs, Foreign Governments (commonly known as Donors) have given these five reasons since 1999 (they keep repeating it... See here in this article by BOND, for example;

"· Lots of southern and smaller CSOs do not have the capacity to fill in all our forms, let alone spend our money effectively.

· We do not have the administrative capacity to give smaller amounts of money.

· We need to channel money through a few, trusted partners so that we can manage risk and comply with our own rules.

· We have strict anti-terror and anti-money laundering rules that make giving directly difficult.

· We are under domestic political pressure to fund through CSOs in our home country."

17.3%

The number of NGOs from the Global South that have access and resources to attend Global Platforms such as UN Meetings, OECD Sessions, World Trade Organization meetings or World Bank Meetings. Most Global Platforms are still a preserve of Northern NGOs.

If you include attendance by Global South sub grantees who generally represent the voice and Agenda of the main International NGO sub granter, this figure falls to less than 3%, meaning Global Advocacy is still for and about a Northern Agenda. For example, over 3000 NGOs engaged with the Intergovernmental process leading the development of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development (commonly known as the SDGs). Of these less than 100, or 3.3% were from the Global South.

And this was only possible because of the push by Southern Member states for ECOSOC to dedicate special funding for Civil Society Organizations from the Global South. Interestingly this concern was analyzed as way back as 1999 by the Global Policy Forum. The CARDOSO Report raised a similar concern, even offering proposals, way back in 2004.Civil Society Organizations in the Global South are still waiting to have it resolved!

$300,000

The size of a project beyond which most European Governments require Southern Civil Society Organization to receive funding through a European NGO, and must have a European Staff to oversee all or part of the leadership of the project, paid for by the grant, at European Rates. This not only significantly depletes the resources available to the Southern Civil Society to implement projects, but forces to recruit European staff with discrepancy pay while deliberately undermining the ability of local Organizations to build their capacity.

8

The number of Governments and Philanthropists that account for 87.6% of Total Funding to Civil Society around the world.This is according to OECD figures and figures from Philanthropic Organizations. Within the OECD, five countries account for nearly 70% of AID to Civil Society Organizations. In 2018 these were the US, Germany,the UK, Japan (mainly to its own NGOs), and, France (primarily to NGOs in its former colonies).

Critiques have raised concern that with so few Governments controlling such a large number of Civil Society Organizations,they are likely to exert undue influence over Policies and advocacy, especially in the knowledge of the fact that all AID is intended to achieve the ever shifting terms for what is essentially a 3D Agenda as a form of soft power (Development, Defense and Diplomacy). Over the last ten years, the concerns have heightened, with Northern Governments accused of hiding behind Aid to control and shape friendly economic and social policies under the new AID Tendering system known as Request for Proposals (RFPs).

11.1%

The total number of Civil Society from the Global South that can afford the $4000 Travel and Accommodation Budget needed to attend WEF (the individual fee of $75,000 and annual institutional fee of $675,000 is waived for Civil Society). Most Southern Organizations have budgets that are tied to specific projects, making it almost impossible to get the extra funding needed to attend advocacy spaces such as WEF

So while Civil Society Organizations are fighting together to secure space for Civil Society, we who are already inside should also ask ourselves why we are unwilling to let others who are less resourced take up the space where their voice can be heard.

HD 	How Powerful Mining Corporations Flagrantly Plunder the Global South Without Consequence

The process of corporate plunder in the global mining industry is severely aggravating social and economic inequalities across the planet.

" The meek shall inherit the Earth, but not its mineral rights." --J. Paul Getty

TD 
	

The big driver of the world economy is a plundering process where powerful corporations loot the natural resources of low-income countries.

These highly influential multinational corporations (MNCs) facilitate the expatriation of profits and natural assets from resource-rich but capital-poor countries by engaging in a wide range of morally egregious profit maximization practices, such as:

Intentionally establishing operations in countries where it is possible to exploit low-wage workers.

Investing in locations where it is possible to take advantage of regressive tax codes.

Ensuring business-friendly production-sharing agreements with local governments.

These predatory practices carried out by MNCs deprive developing countries from being able to benefit equitably from their own natural resource supply and ultimately undermine their pursuit of emancipatory economic development policies.

How do systematic underdevelopment and exploitation of developing countries and their peoples occur? Two common strategies of corporate plunder through global extractive industries are rent-seeking and wage exploitation.

Extractive Industries

Extractive industries are the starting point of the main drivers in the global economy. They deal with the development, extraction, and sale of exhaustible (nonrenewable) natural resources such as the mining of metals and minerals and the extraction of oil and natural gas, according to the Encyclopedia of Environmental Change , edited by John A. Matthews.

Global extraction of natural resources has increased with the onset of the process of capitalist industrialization, growing at an astounding rate in the past 50 years. Global extraction of primary materials more than tripled to 92 billion tonnes in 2017 from 27 billion tonnes in 1970, an annual average growth of 2.6 percent , according to a 2019 report conducted by the United Nations Environment Programme-hosted International Resource Panel (IRP).

For many countries in the Global South, extractive industries are an important aspect of their economy; yet, in many instances, low-income countries only retain a small fraction of the total wealth that is generated from their domestic natural resource production.

The highly capital-intensive nature of the extractive industry requires expensive upfront costs as well as ongoing investment to replace, modernize, and expand equipment and facilities, which forces communities and governments of poor countries to rely on foreign firms for financial assistance.

As a result, such countries are prevented from being able to fully absorb the financial returns generated from their national resource endowments.

The continent of Africa in particular has historically accounted for a significant portion of global extractive production and supply, serving as a catalyst for the economic development of the Global North through low-wage labor and corporate ownership of the region's natural resources.

Who Controls the Global Extractive and Mining Industries?

Over the past several decades, multinational corporations have emerged as the primary actors in facilitating global trade and natural resource extraction, yielding tremendous profits.

Large corporations, which account for the bulk of international trade and resource extraction, have experienced rising rents under hyperglobalization, leading to heightened profits. This was confirmed by empirical analysis of the largest 2,000 MNCs, which revealed that the share of profits of extractive MNCs rose from 9.3 percent in 1996 to 13.3 percent in 2015.

Meanwhile, a separate study, which measured the influence of corporate power in the global supply chain (GSC), estimated that about 80 percent of global trade (in terms of gross exports) is linked to the international production networks of transnational corporations.

The trade, production and ownership of the extractive industries have become particularly concentrated among a small number of exporters, importers and MNCs.

Recent evidence of rising market concentration among MNCs within certain sectors of the extractive industry, particularly the mining industry , has prompted concerns among some economists regarding the links between increased market concentration, income inequality, and rent-seeking .

According to a 2018 study conducted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) rent-seeking practices by MNCs on the rise in key sectors of the global economy have become a major driver of global income inequality.

The term "rent-seeking" is used by economists to describe a type of profit-making scheme, the sort made possible when individuals or corporate entities are granted exclusive or majority rights to natural and/or non-natural assets.

Thus, the phrase is frequently associated with monopoly (or quasi-monopoly) rent, a form of "unearned" income, which can be generated when large corporate entities exclude competitors from entering the market for the services or products that they supply.

Monopoly Rents in the Global Mining Industry

A potential entrant into the global mining market would have to invest at least several billion U.S. dollars to launch a competitive, large-scale mining operation.

Large-scale mining, which accounts for 95 percent of global mining production , is carried out by private corporations with various ownership structures (from publicly traded to state owned) and sizes: companies range from 150 or so "senior" mining companies with over $3 billion in assets to thousands of smaller "junior" companies.

The data above is largely consistent with the findings from a 2018 report carried out by global auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which showed that the capitalization threshold to rank among the world's top 40 largest mining corporations is estimated to be at around $5.4 billion.

The capital-intensive nature of the industry poses significant barriers for entry into the market, causing a high degree of market concentration in the global mining sector. This claim is further supported by a report conducted by Chatham House , which found that jointly, the four largest companies in iron ore, bauxite, and copper mining control 41 percent, 41 percent and 31 percent, respectively, of global mine production.

This data presents a pattern of quasi-monopolistic market patterns among a group of powerful MNCs in the global mining industry. This trend has limited the ownership over the share of rents generated from the global mining industry to a small number of powerful and highly profitable corporations.

Political Rents, the Rentier State and Corporate Rentiers

While a "significant proportion of [corporate] rents has... accrued through monopolies or quasi-monopolies," as the UNCTAD study reports , some income (rents) can also be generated by what is referred to as "'political rents' derived from the ability to influence particular aspects and details of government policies in ways that disproportionately" favor corporate entities.

The recent growth in global corporate rent-seeking practices by MNCs is partially facilitated through what is referred to as the "rentier state," which is comprised of various public institutions and legal policies, including: cheap exploration permits, flexible labor laws, and low tax rates that benefit the interests of "rentiers" (corporate investors).

Tax revenues, specifically from the mining industry, have tremendous potential to improve the quality of life of citizens, particularly the poorest segments of the population; however, corporate rentiers (MNCs) perceive tariffs and levies as a financial burden that will inevitably reduce their profit margins.

For instance, in 2011, the Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) corporation, which is the " largest private employer in Zambia ," with an estimated 16,000 employees, only paid $105 million in taxes on "its $2.16 billion worth of production, amounting to an effective tax rate of less than 5 percent. "

Sadly, over the past several decades, many mineral-rich rentier-states have entered a downward spiral in an attempt to incentivize foreign investment, offering MNCs low tax rates and favorable production-sharing agreements.

The loss of developing countries' capacities to retain earnings due to "political rents" accrued by corporate investors has been extensively documented and is particularly evident in the Zambian mining industry.

Wage Exploitation

While not strictly classified as rent-seeking, multinational mining companies engage in yet another form of corporate plunder, which takes place through wage exploitation.

Wage exploitation is a process that ensures increased profit margins for corporate owners and any potential company shareholders, at the expense of workers.

In empirical research conducted by Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research, we observed extensive levels of wage exploitation in the Zambian mining industry, which is one of the world's most resource-endowed countries with vast mineral deposits.

Despite the county's immense mineral reserves, our research revealed that in exchange for their labor, many Zambian copper miners are paid next to nothing for their services.

In order to get a sense of wage exploitation and the general labor conditions in the Zambian mining industry, Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research spoke with three non-permanent contract miners working at the Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) owned mine.

In our discussions, all three men reported that their current wages prevented them from being able to fulfill their own basic needs and those of their families.*

" The wages that we receive are well below the cost of the basic food basket" (defined by the World Bank as "the food bundle corresponding to a minimum caloric requirement"). "If you look at our salaries, we are earning no more than US$172 [per month]," Miner 1 told Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research in an interview conducted last January.

In 2018, Zambia's monthly minimum wage stood around US$176.4, making it the fifth-highest average minimum wage in the Southern African region, according to statistics from the World Bank.

" So, we are actually earning less than the national minimum wage, which makes it nearly impossible to survive," Miner 1 went on to say.

Technically, it is a legal offense not to meet minimum wage demands; however, penalties are rarely imposed on foreign multinational companies that violate the country's national labor code.

These miners' testimonies are largely consistent with the empirical research and the subsequent calculations that we carried out in order to determine wage exploitation in the Zambian mining industry.

Our calculations were based on two separate collective bargaining agreements, which detailed the monthly wages earned by KCM permanent contract employees and the monthly wages obtained by temporary contract workers.

Based on the empirical data collected, we observed an extraordinary gap in monetary compensation between the top executives of Vedanta (KCM's parent company) and the average annual wages earned by KCM permanent contract miners and temporary contract hires.

For example, according to our research, in 2018 Chairman Anil Agarwal earned around 584 times as much as temporary contract workers and close to 164 times as much as a KCM miner with a permanent contract.

Labor strikes in Zambia's mining sector are commonplace. In 2017, business operations for KCM in Chililabombwe were brought to a standstill after workers went on strike over salary adjustments.

" I think that most of us miners believe that companies like KCM are in fact stealing from us. They are stepping on our rights, and as a result we are living in abject poverty," Miner 2 said when asked about his perception of the multinational mining firms operating in his country.

With nearly 60 percent of the country's population living below the poverty line, it seems completely reasonable to suggest that Zambian people are deserving of a greater share of the lucrative financial returns generated by their country's mining industry.

In summary, it is our hope that this research helped illustrate how the combination of both wage exploitation in the context of the Zambian mining industry along with corporate rent-seeking practices in the global extractive sector contribute to the larger pattern of underdevelopment in the Global South.

HD 	The Global South Is Changing How Knowledge Is Made, Shared and Used

Globalisation and new technology have changed the ways that knowledge is made, disseminated and consumed. At the push of a button, one can find articles or sources from all over the world. Yet the global knowledge economy is still marked by its history.

The former colonial nations of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries - the rich countries of Europe and North America which are collectively called the global North (normally considered to include the West and the first world, the North contains a quarter of the world's population but controls 80% of income earned) - are still central in the knowledge economy. But the story is not one simply of Northern dominance. A process of making knowledge in the South is underway.

TD 
	

European colonisers encountered many sophisticated and complex knowledge systems among the colonised. These had their own intellectual workforces, their own environmental, geographical, historical and medical sciences. They also had their own means of developing knowledge. Sometimes the colonisers tried to obliterate these knowledges.

In other instances colonisers appropriated local knowledge, for instance in agriculture, fisheries and mining. Sometimes they recognised and even honoured other knowledge systems and intellectuals. This was the case among some of the British in India, and was the early form of "Orientalism", the study of people and cultures from the East.

In the past few decades, there's been more critique of global knowledge inequalities and the global North's dominance. There have also been shifts in knowledge production patterns; some newer disciplines have stepped away from old patterns of inequality.

These issues are examined in a new book, Knowledge and Global Power: Making new sciences in the South (published by Wits University Press), which I co-authored with Fran Collyer, Raewyn Connell and Joao Maia. The focus is especially on those areas where old patterns are not being replicated, so the study chooses climate change, gender and HIV and AIDS as three new areas of knowledge production in which new voices from the South might be prominent.

Local knowledge for local purposes

The critique levelled against inequalities in global knowledge production takes several forms. One is "post-colonial theory" - theories inspired from India and the Arab world that analyse unequal power relations in the period after the formal end of colonialism, focusing on the subordination or marginalisation of populations formerly living in colonial contexts.

The "de-colonial" movement is another example. It explores ways of exposing modernist assumptions and developing new ways of thinking that cut loose from knowledge inequalities. It draws its lessons from the colonisation of Latin America.

There has also been a call from some for a return to indigenous knowledge. But here the consequences have not always been happy, as seen in South Africa's attempt to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic by using local healing practices. Former president Thabo Mbeki saw traditional medicine as the antithesis of an exploitative Western pharmaceutical industry. He rejected the use of antiretroviral drugs rather than making these approaches mutually supporting. It was a devastating mistake that cost as many as 330 000 people their lives.

Scholars like Paulin Hountondji from Benin emphasise the active processes of knowledge production that arise in colonised societies and which have a capacity to speak beyond them. The emphasis in this concept is on communication between and within knowledge systems, rather than on separation.

Producing knowledge for local purposes, rather than for export into a global knowledge economy, has long been part of the work of intellectuals in colonial and post-colonial societies. This may be for activist purposes, such as the nationalist histories written to support the struggles for independence. Or it may respond to problems that hardly exist in the global North, such as the social issues in post-colonial mega-cities. Recognising local agendas for knowledge formation is important even in the mainstream knowledge economy.

And yet, arguably, the authority of Northern-centred knowledge formations is growing.

Knowledge production

This is where the idea of Southern theory emerges. Coined by one of the book's authors, Professor Raewyn Connell, this refers to social thought from the societies of the global South.

Alternative approaches to knowledge exist and are being produced. A wealth of new knowledge has emerged from colonised peoples, from settler populations, and from post-colonial societies grappling with dependence, violence and new forms of exploitation.

The demonstrated existence of Northern dominance and influence does not imply Southern passivity, nor uncontested domination. Knowledge production is now negotiated, and creative ways of participating are devised.

Southern knowledge workers still have to work within a global knowledge labour system which endorses, for example, the power of publishing houses, top-ranked universities and highly cited researchers. But they are also able to exercise control over their own labours. They do this by creating local research programmes, founding research centres, and linking research to public policy that addresses local problems in distinctive ways.

Among knowledge workers in the South, Southern Tier work forces, there is evidence of change and contestation, the development of local knowledges, and complex interweaving of Northern paradigms and Southern Tier experiences. The global North's share of scientific publications has declined recently, and the Southern Tier has participated in the changing balance. These changes show that the structure of the global economy of knowledge is not static.

The value of connection

The research for this book found that many of respondents value connections around the global periphery. Brazilians seek links with researchers across Latin America and in Africa; South Africans connect across their continent; Australians develop links in the Asia-Pacific region.

The connections that have already been made show a practical basis for the logic of connecting knowledge projects between North and South and between South and South. In a neoliberal context marked by increasing cutbacks in research funding, it will have to be intellectual workers themselves, and social movements in the global South, who push for new forms of solidarity in global knowledge production that contribute to development and freedom, peace and democracy.

HD 	Communication, a Key Tool for South-South Cooperation

Communication can be a key tool for the development of cooperation among the countries of the global South, but the ever closer relations between them do not receive the attention they deserve from the media.

This conclusion arose from the meeting organised by Inter Press Service (IPS) Latin America in Buenos Aires on Mar. 22, during the third and final day of the Second High-Level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, which brought together representatives of almost 200 countries in the Argentine capital.

TD 
	

"The role of communication in the challenge of South-South cooperation" was the colloquium that brought together journalists, political analysts and officials from international organisations in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia.

"There is little coverage on what progress has been made in trade, technology or health cooperation among the countries of the South, which may seem very different among themselves but are quite similar in terms of their needs." -- Mario Lubetkin

The colloquium, organised by the regional branch of the international news agency IPS, was one of the parallel meetings to the conference and the only one dedicated to communication.

"Forty years ago, when the first conference, also held in Buenos Aires, approved the Plan of Action that forms the basis of South-South Ccoperation, there was awareness that communication was key," said Mario Lubetkin, assistant director-general of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).

"However, that notion has been lost and communication has not kept up with the changes that have taken place since then. This creates a vacuum for our societies," said Lubetkin, the moderator of the meeting.

"There is little coverage on what progress has been made in trade, technology or health cooperation among the countries of the South, which may seem very different among themselves but are quite similar in terms of their needs," concluded Lubetkin, a former director general of IPS, an international news agency that prioritises information from the global South.

In front of an audience made up mainly of journalists and other media workers, the debate was oriented towards the most appropriate tools for developing countries to better disseminate news from the global South, the latest term coined to define the group of nations in Africa, Latin America and Asia.

The president of IPS Latin America, Sergio Berensztein, stressed that "today there is an opportunity for nations like ours, thanks to the fact that there is no longer the biloparity of the Cold War era, nor the unipolarity of the years that followed. Today we are in a time of what we call apolarity."

Berensztein stressed that at a time when there is a renaissance of protectionism and nationalism in the world, it is necessary for journalists to reinforce the idea of cooperation and ensure that a plurality of voices is heard on the international stage.

"We are living in a moment of crisis in which the old has not fully died yet and the new has not yet been fully born. That is why it is a time of uncertainty and accurate information is an element that favors the peaceful resolution of conflicts," said Berensztein.

The power of the large media based in countries of the industrialised North, which tend to impose their journalistic agenda on a global level, was present in the debate as a worrying factor and as evidence of the failure of initiatives aimed at bringing about a new and more balanced information and communication order.

"What is the best way to foment the mass circulation of information about the global South, in order to escape this problem?" was one of the main questions that arose during the two-hour debate, held at a hotel in the Argentine capital.

From the city of Lagos, in a videoconference, the news director of the Nigerian Television Authority, Aliyu Baba Barau, called for strengthened cooperation between media outlets and journalists from developing countries, through the organisation of trips and mechanisms that favour the sharing of resources.

"Nigerian TV permanently shares its resources with other countries," he said as an example of what can be done in terms of cooperation in media projects in the South.

"The mechanism of South-South cooperation and its advantages need to be understood not only by those who lead our nations, but also by the global community," said Baba Barau.

Media representatives from China played a prominent role in the exchange of ideas and reflected the strong interest in Asia's giant in achieving closer ties with Africa and Latin America.

Participants included Zhang Lu, deputy editor of China Daily, the country's largest English-language news portal; Cui Yuanlei, Mexico correspondent for the Xinhua news agency, which distributes information in several languages (including Spanish); and Li Weilin, team leader of the CCTV television network in São Paulo, Brazil.

Li said the media in emerging countries should not depend on the information distributed by the news networks of industrialised countries, and said journalism should be a way to share experiences.

He said, for example, that during the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, CCTV produced coverage for people in Kenya to see how Jamaica's star runners were trained, and for Jamaica to meet the Kenyan runners who perform so well in the long-distance and medium-distance races.

Roberto Ridolfi, Assistant-Director General of FAO's Programme Support and Technical Cooperation Department, stressed that the countries of the South "do not have a shared past, but they do have the same future."

Ridolfi said communication has a key role to play in the arduous path towards Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which seek to improve the quality of life of the world's population and bring the South into line with the level of development in the North.

"The media and journalists have the mission of attracting audiences with news linked to sustainability. The proliferation of plastics in the oceans, the devastation of forests or the problems plaguing food production are issues that should be on the agenda," he said.

Like the other panelists, Ridolfi lamented that societies are unaware of the South-South cooperation mechanisms that have emerged in recent years and said journalists have a lot of work to do in that regard.

"We have yet to demonstrate to the world the real value and benefits of South-South cooperation," the FAO official said.

The need for African, Asian, Latin American and Arab media to get to know each other better was recognised as a necessity.

The local participants were particularly emphatic about this, since Argentina is a country with deep cultural ties with Europe, where little is known about what happens in the countries of the regions of the South, beyond catastrophes and conflicts.

The challenge, now that new technologies have democratised communication but have also put it at risk, is to generate information from the South in attractive formats that allow a better understanding of the realities and opportunities in developing countries and between the countries and regions of the South.

HD 	South-South Cooperation - a Path to Implementing UN's 2030 Agenda

I see five issues that will be central to implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change and achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. South-South Cooperation can offer solutions to all of them.

First, rising inequality both between and within countries is eroding trust and deepening a sense of injustice. Globalization has enabled many people to escape poverty - but its benefits are not shared equitably and its costs fall disproportionately on the poor and vulnerable.

TD 
	

Cooperation can enable developing countries to learn from each other and grow more quickly, close income gaps and build inclusive, resilient societies.

Second, climate change is the defining issue of our time, and we are losing the race. 2018 was the fourth hottest year on record and natural disasters are impacting nearly every region.

That is why I am bringing world leaders together at a climate action summit in New York in September. I am calling on leaders to bring concrete, realistic plans that raise ambition on mitigation, adaptation, finance and innovation.

We must enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent over the next decade.

We need fundamental shifts to support green financing and increase investment in climate action from billions to trillions.

The Green Climate Fund must become fully resourced and operational. And the pledge to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year by 2020 for climate action in the developing world, including mitigation and adaptation, must be implemented.

South-South cooperation will be vital to ensure mutual support and exchange of best practices, to enhance adaptation and increase the resilience of developing countries and communities facing the devastating impacts of climate change.

South-South Cooperation can also support the transformation of economies dependent on fossil fuels, with strategies that reinforce both sustainable development and environmental protection.

Third, infrastructure and energy needs are set to expand enormously, thanks to population growth and urbanization in the Global South.

Some 60 percent of the area that is expected to become urban by 2030 has yet to be built. If we get this wrong, we will lock ourselves into a high-emissions future with potentially catastrophic consequences.

But if we get infrastructure right, it will be an opportunity for development cooperation, industrial transition and growth, cross-border trade and investment, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and sustainable development.

Fourth, gender has been described as the docking station for the SDGs, since it offers opportunities to engage on different crosscutting issues. It must be at the heart of all efforts if we are to succeed.

We have seen significant progress for women over the past forty years. More girls are in school; more women are doing paid work. Harmful practices like female genital mutilation and child marriage are in decline.

But this progress is not complete; indeed, we are seeing a pushback against our efforts and in some cases the gender equality gap is widening.

This affects us all, because where women are better represented in politics, we see improved social protection and increased spending on development. When women have access to land and credit, harvests increase. When girls are educated, they contribute more to their communities and break cycles of poverty.

And let's not forget that countries with the highest number of women in parliament, in national security institutions, and as farmers, are indeed in the Global South.

Fifth, the multilateral development system must be better positioned to support South-South cooperation and implement the 2030 Agenda.

South-South cooperation has evolved significantly over the last decades - but multilateral institutions, including the United Nations, have not kept up.

I am grateful to Member States for recognizing the role of the United Nations in the outcome document for the South-South Conference (in Buenos Aires). We will take up the mandates you are entrusting to us, and you can count on my personal commitment to make sure the ongoing reforms of the United Nations reinvigorate our support for South-South cooperation.

We also need to realign financing for sustainable development and unlock the trillions that will deliver the 2030 Agenda.

South-South cooperation can never be a substitute for official development assistance or replace the responsibilities of the Global North set out in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris Agreement.

South-South Cooperation must also involve young people, civil society, the private sector, academia and others, building innovative partnerships and extending the reach of initiatives. It must harness the potential of new technologies and digitalization that create opportunities and promote inclusivity.

South-South cooperation is a global exercise of all countries of the South to benefit everyone, including the Least Developed Countries. Every country, every partner has something to share or teach, whatever their circumstances.

This conference is a starting point.

Later this year, over the course of a week in September, Heads of State will gather in New York for the Sustainable Development Goals Summit and the Climate Action Summit. They will discuss Universal Health Coverage, Financing Sustainable Development and the Global Partnership to support Small Island Developing States.

All these meetings are aimed at accelerating implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, which were born from a consensus on the common interests that bind us together.

Now is the time to stake out that common ground again and take bold and transformative action.

Together, we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we can beat climate change, and transform the lives of people around the world.

I thank the Government and people of Argentina for hosting this Conference.

Forty years ago, the landmark international conference on South-South Cooperation resulted in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries.

Since then, the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, known as BAPA, has been the foundation and reference point for South-South cooperation, based on principles of national ownership, equality and non-conditionality.

BAPA transformed the dynamics of international cooperation.

It highlighted the value of a different form of cooperation, based on the exchange of knowledge and appropriate technologies among nations facing similar development challenges.

Across the global South, we have seen remarkable advances since BAPA. Thanks in part to South-South cooperation, millions of women, men and children have been lifted out of extreme poverty. Developing countries have achieved some of the fastest economic growth rates ever seen and have set global standards for sustainable development.

As we gather again in Buenos Aires, we recognize and celebrate the long journey we have walked together.

But we also recognize our common challenges.

Today, we are here to ensure that South-South cooperation remains responsive to the evolving realities of global development and the changing needs of developing countries as they implement the 2030 Agenda.

We have an opportunity to develop and strengthen frameworks for South-South cooperation; improve systems and tools; increase transparency; and strengthen accountability.

*Extracts from a keynote address by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to the Conference on South-South Conference in Buenos Aires on March 20, 2019.

The BAPA+40 Zero Draft Outcome Document--to be adopted at the upcoming conference on the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA+40) in Argentina March 20-22- is much like a conference report intended to accommodate different points of view.

It is neither a visionary policy nor substantive action-oriented agenda needed to bolster South-South cooperation (SSC) and give it greater importance in the United Nations system, which would normally be expected from a once-in-a-decade high-level UN conference.

TD 
	

Having been drafted carefully to take into account views and sensitivities of the developed countries, which have not been overly enthusiastic about South-South cooperation, the document could not give adequate prominence to preferences and position of developing countries, the major interested party and leading force of that cooperation.

Initial comments on and reactions to the Zero Draft reflect continuing disagreements and underlying policy differences between the South and the North regarding the nature and objectives of South-South cooperation.

Given - (a). the contents and policy limitations of the Draft Outcome Document, which largely delimit the final outcome of the Conference; (b). the traditional misgivings of the developed countries about SSC and their efforts to constrain its development; (c). the political and institutional obstacles that limit the UN role and engagement of its staff in promoting SSC; and (d). the absence of a comprehensive, up-to-date South platform for SSC and the differences that exist among the South's large and diverse constituency - the Group of 77 would do well already now to begin preparing for the period following BAPA+40.

Initially, in its BAPA+40 follow-up, the G77 should address - in its own circle and in a comprehensive manner - the challenges and opportunities facing South-South cooperation.

Taking into account the outcome of the 2019 Buenos Aires Conference and the lessons learned during its preparatory process, proceedings and negotiations, a new effort should be undertaken to elaborate a G77 South-South cooperation policy platform and agenda for action.

In this context, it is important to recall the G77 1981 Caracas Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries (ECDC), which followed the 1978 Buenos Aires Conference on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC).

Both Conferences were part and parcel of the Global South's New International Economic Order (NIEO) initiatives during that period. The Caracas event had to be organized outside the UN, but it relied on logistical and substantive support of the UNCTAD Secretariat.

The goal was to carry on with the process beyond what had been possible to achieve in Buenos Aires and in the framework of the UN itself. The Caracas Programme of Action on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries (A/36/333) was adopted.

It broadened the concept to incorporate "economic cooperation among developing countries" beyond the politically and substantively restricted "technical assistance", projects-centred approach dealt with in Buenos Aires (A/CONF.79/13/Rev.1).

However, the concept of ECDC could not properly be institutionalized in the UN framework due to the opposition of the developed countries. Indeed, in the institutional-reform sweep in the 1990s, driven and inspired by these countries, even the UNCTAD Unit on ECDC was closed.

As part of its continuing initiative in the UN, the Group of 77 began to champion a broader concept, namely "South-South cooperation", elaborated in the 1990 Report of the South Commission, The Challenge to the South. In 1994, G77, in its Ministerial Declaration, urged the UN to convene an international conference on South-South cooperation in 1996.

The resolution on South-South cooperation adopted subsequently by the UN General Assembly, inter alia called on the UN Secretary-General, in preparing his report on the state of South-South cooperation, to keep "in view the proposal to convene an international conference on South-South cooperation".

This non-committal wording reflected the lack of developed countries' support for the idea. And, in fact, it took nearly 15 years before such a conference could be held in the UN - the 2009 Nairobi High-level Conference on South-South Cooperation - and before the concept of South-South cooperation was anointed in this Organization.

One can argue that the suspicion harboured by key actors in the North vis-à-vis SSC has not basically changed, even though these countries now exhibit a greater tactical flexibility due to the changing realities, including the emergence of and the challenge posed by "the rising South".

Given the differences of outlook between the North and the South, and political and administrative constraints that UN organizations and staff experience in their work to advance the process of South-South cooperation and to assist the developing countries in this domain, a satisfactory outcome of the three-day BAPA+40 North-South encounter does not seem likely from the point of view of the Group of 77.

It would, thus, be propitious for the Group to begin considering a similar approach to the one it had adopted after the 1978 Buenos Aires TCDC Conference, when it decided to hold its own ECDC conference in 1981 in Caracas.

In view of the existing situation, possibly in the final stage of the 2019 Buenos Aires Conference, the Group of 77 should highlight the coming 40th anniversary of the 1981 Caracas Conference by announcing the launching of its own South-South follow-up, as a sequel to BAPA+40.

In this way, G77 and its member states would commit themselves to review and formally consider the nature of South-South cooperation and its role in development and in the evolving geopolitical setting.

This would be a collective undertaking, pursued within one's own circle and policy space, with the goal being to elaborate a Global South's policy and action-oriented agenda for South-South cooperation, without the developed countries present to influence the parameters of that cooperation.

While centred on SSC actions and needs within the Global South, the proposed follow-up would also need to address, as a separate issue, the role of the UN and UN system in actively supporting South-South cooperation, as an important dimension of international development cooperation and, indeed, of democratic global governance.

Two events already on the agenda could contribute to the follow-up process in the initial stage. The Group of 77 ministerial conference, planned to mark the 55th anniversary of the Group's establishment, could consider SSC issues and follow-up to BAPA+40, including the re-launching of some ideas and projects agreed on in the past but not implemented.

Also, as suggested by the G77 Geneva Chapter in its comment on the Zero Draft, the next quadrennial UNCTAD conference, UNCTAD XV in 2020, will be an opportunity to pave the way for a far more active policy and substantive and action-oriented role of the UN by entrusting UNCTAD with some key domains of SSC.

These include ECDC, trade, finance, investment, technology, services, and regional and sub-regional integration, in which it had played an important and pioneering role in the past.

UNCTAD XV would also be an appropriate forum where to consider the larger institutional issue, namely of a leading role that UNCTAD, in partnership with and the support of the UN regional economic commissions and the South-South economic groupings, could play in spearheading and energizing the role of the UN and UN system in support of SSC.

When considering a possible G77 follow-up process to BAPA+40 and how to deal with shortcomings and weaknesses that have affected SSC and how to reinvigorate it in the coming period and beyond, the issue that merits priority attention is the need for institutional self-empowerment of the Global South, which is seriously handicapped by not having its own global institution, one similar to the North's OECD.

A strong organization of the South is a sine qua non of the necessary drive and long-term institutional leadership and focus for the evolving process of South-South cooperation.

This institutional deficiency cannot be overcome by relying solely on the UN, especially in its present vulnerable situation when it is under the pressure of the key developed countries. Nor can one expect this function to be undertaken by individual developing countries.

A collective self-organization at the global level is of utmost priority and importance, including for a common review of the problems and challenges faced, for distilling common views and positions, and for the participation of all countries of the Global South.

BAPA+40 and its follow-up process in the fold of the Group of 77 would provide a political impulse to inaugurating a vital action for establishing an organization that would serve as the Global South's own lead mechanism in the promising and all-important domain of South-South, as well as international and multilateral cooperation, an organization that would work in parallel with, complement and stimulate the efforts of the UN family as a whole.

A decision to establish a major, significant global organization of the Global South for South-South cooperation would represent a landmark event on the world scene.

In conclusion, it can be argued that, despite problems and political tensions within the South, between and within its countries, often with the involvement of actors from the North, and also despite crises in the global economy and turbulences in the multilateral system of international cooperation, the overall context today is favourable for South-South cooperation.

On the geopolitical front, the spread of right-wing populism and the migrant crisis, as well as major political and economic changes in the North, are reflected in the mounting global interventionism, the negative attitude towards the developing countries' aspirations, and the disregard for multilateralism and values on which the United Nations is founded.

This will require of the developing countries actively to seek solutions through South-South cooperation, collective self-reliance, solidarity, an overarching political stance and initiatives regarding global concerns and issues.

The upcoming conference on the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA+40), scheduled to take place in the Argentine capital on 20-22 March 2019, ought to be more than just another UN conference where the developing countries assemble to present their demands and seek support from the North.

Also, it must not turn out to be a replay of the 2009 1st UN High-level Conference on South-South Cooperation*, i.e. an anodyne event in terms of impact and follow-up, though such a scenario may be preferred by some, risk of which exists since the 2019 gathering is also scheduled to last only three days, not enough time for genuine deliberations and negotiations.

TD 
	

Therefore, it is up to the developing countries to build up BAPA+40 into a major global event.

a. South-South cooperation and the United Nations system

One of the key objectives of the Global South at BAPA+40 should be to place South-South cooperation at the very centre of the UN system of multilateral cooperation.

The UN system needs to recognize the diversity and broad spectrum that SSC subsumes, to resist the limits being imposed on SSC and it being distanced and cut off from its original institutional and political roots and aspirations.

The United Nations ought to introduce clear and specific measures and programmes, necessary human and financial resources, and mandates by "mainstreaming" and "enhancing support" for SSC in every organization and agency of the UN system, to have them incorporate the needs and objectives of South-South cooperation.

It needs also to be reiterated that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for North-South development cooperation, but a parallel and new sphere of multilateral cooperation that opens new and promising opportunities, stimulates North-South cooperation, and provides alternative and innovative approaches in development cooperation.

In the fold of the UN, a significant, yet very limited step to mainstream South-South Cooperation has been taken by upgrading the UNDP Special Unit for TCDC first into a Special Unit for South-South Cooperation and then into the UN Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC).

This cannot and should not be the end-station, but needs to be followed up ambitiously and seriously at the global level, by appointment of a UN Secretary-General's high level representative who would provide political vision for South-South cooperation and the establishment of a UN specialized entity within the UNDP platform or in the UN Development System (UNDS) in the making, whose mission would be to promote South-South cooperation, as recommended by the Group of 77 Ministerial Meeting.

Any such entity would need to have its own intergovernmental machinery, a major capital development fund for South-South projects, and fully staffed substantive secretariat equipped to perform a number of important functions, including initiating and funding projects, undertaking research, maintaining a data base on SSC and a directory of national actors involved in SSC, and publishing a regular, periodic UN report on South-South Cooperation called for by G77 Summits.

A suggestion has been floated to consider entrusting this task to UNCTAD, given that its mandate concerning North-South issues has been eroded and its role marginalized.

Such a central entity for SSC would need to be backed, at the regional level, by greatly strengthened and invigorated UN regional economic commissions in the South.

These Commissions are the principal UN bodies based in and with a full knowledge of their respective regions. Their key mission should be the promotion of South-South cooperation or "horizontal cooperation", as traditionally referred to in Latin America.

The proposed structure, drawing also on UN specialized agencies in their areas of competence, would have as one of its tasks to support and energize sub-regional, regional and inter-regional South-South cooperation.

Regular, high-level UN conferences on South-South cooperation would need to be convened, and a consolidated and regular substantive, analytical and statistical UN report on the state of South-South cooperation will need to be prepared.

b. Global South and South-South cooperation

Given the overall global context, the developing countries cannot rely solely on the United Nations, even if and when the suggested institutional improvements are approved and become operational.

South-South cooperation is an opportunity for the Global South to contribute to achieving a number of outstanding goals and aspirations and be a vehicle for reshaping the global system.

For this to happen, however, what is needed on the part of the developing countries is hard work, mobilization of resources and of collective power, major and sustained efforts and commitment/obligation to pursue and attain a series of objectives that need to be identified and agreed on.

In their efforts to follow this advice, in addition to many practical obstacles and problems, the developing countries would also encounter opposition and doubts within their own ranks, not to mention a frontal or undercover resistance by actors of the North.

This resistance would especially come from those who would consider every major move in that direction as a potential threat to their own interests and global designs, and would, very likely, take steps, including within individual developing countries, often with local support and even via "inconvenient" regime and leadership change, to influence and embroil the collective efforts.

What matters, however, is that today the Global South has the resources and collective power to move forward, and that this is not a "mission impossible", as some who are familiar with problems and difficulties encountered in South-South cooperation efforts and undertakings and the building and management of joint institutions might point out. There is little that stands in the way of:

- Undertaking a critical, in-depth review and analysis of: South-South cooperation, important actions and proposals agreed on over the years and their implementation, experiences, public attitudes, performance of individual countries, functioning of joint institutions and mechanisms of cooperation and integration, main obstacles and shortcomings that call for action, including the all too frequent difficulties or failure to follow up on important decisions taken at the political level.

- Focussing on how to resolve the issue of lack of adequate financing for South-South cooperation, activities, projects and institutions, probably one of the most serious practical obstacles standing in the way of SSC being put into practice as desired and called for.

- Inspiring, informing about and involving in the South-South cooperation project the public and individuals; with this in mind, applying capacity-building and training to raise the awareness of the existing experiences and opportunities; using to this end also educational, marketing, media and public relations approaches, which are so common in contemporary society and are used not only to advertise and publicize goods and services, but also political and social goals and causes, in this case the common identity of the South as an entity.

- Setting up a South organization for South-South cooperation, and pooling together and networking intellectual and analytical resources available in the South and internationally to staff and support the work of that institution.

- Placing on the agenda the challenge of intellectual self-empowerment of the Global South and the harnessing of its intellectual resources and institutions into an interactive network for support of common goals and collective actions.

- Evolving, at the highest level, a representative system of political authority (e.g., heads of state or government, one delegated from each region) for regular and ad hoc communication, consultations and contacts, for meetings to assess progress in the implementation of agreed SSC goals, and for communication/interaction with all heads of state and/or government in the Global South.

- Based on the workings and experience of the South Commission, of the now defunct UN Committee on Development Planning and of the G77 High-Level Panel of Eminent Personalities of the South, to consider establishing a permanent South-South commission or committee to bring together, on a regular basis, high-stature personalities and thinkers from the South to reflect and deliberate on challenges faced by the developing countries and by the international community.

- Elaborating and agreeing on a blueprint for national self-empowerment for South-South cooperation, to guide and be used as a reference by the individual developing countries in line with their own characteristics and capacities, and transforming this blueprint into a legal instrument binding for all developing countries.

- Nurturing, training and educating future cadres and leaders for South-South cooperation, directly exposing them to and familiarizing them with different problems and different regions of the South, and, when they are ready, deploying them in national, sub-regional, regional and multilateral, including UN, settings.

- Focussing on the role of "digital South-South cooperation" in the promotion and energizing of all forms of South-South cooperation, including closer contacts, communication, information sharing and interaction, mutual understanding between and among the peoples and countries of the South, transfer of technology, and education and culture.

- Calling for closer cooperation between and joint initiatives of G77 and NAM, an important pending political and institutional topic on the agenda of the Global South.

There is little new in the above suggestions, which draw on practical experiences and have been articulated over the years and in different contexts. What they propose is within reach, is doable, and would represent a major "leap forward" for South-South cooperation.

What is needed today is firm political will, long-term vision and determined initiative for a group of the South's countries and leaders to launch such a process on the desired track and, most importantly, sustain it with the necessary political commitment and financial and institutional support.

The 2019 Buenos Aires Conference in March next year is an opportunity for the South to stand up and raise its collective voice, as at the very beginnings of South-South cooperation in Bandung (1955), Belgrade (1961), Geneva (1964) and Algiers (1967).

HD 	Creating an African Bamboo Industry As Large As China's

The bamboo industry in China currently comprises up to 10 million people who make a living out of production of the grass. But while the Asian nation has significant resources of bamboo -- three million hectares of plantation and three million hectares of natural forests -- the continent of Africa is recorded to have an estimated three and a half million hectares of plantations, excluding conservation areas.

This means that there is a possibility of creating a similar size industry in Africa, according to International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) director general Dr. Hans Friederich.

TD 
	

"In China, where the industry is developed, we have eight to 10 million people who make a living out of bamboo. They grow bamboo, manufacture things out of bamboo and sell bamboo poles. That has given them a livelihood and a way to build a local economy to create a future for themselves and their children," he tells IPS.

INBAR is the only international organisation championing the development of environmentally sustainable bamboo and rattan. It has 44 member states -- 43 of which are in the global south -- with the secretariat headquarters based in China, and with regional offices in India, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Ecuador. Over the years, the multilateral development organisation has trained up to 25,000 people across the value chain - from farmers and foresters to entrepreneurs and policymakers.

Excerpts of the interview follow:

Inter Press Service (IPS): What has been INBAR's Role in the South-South Cooperation agenda?

Dr. Hans Friederich (DHF): In fact, a lot of our work over the last 21 years is to link our headquarters in China with our regional offices and our members around the world to help develop policies, put in place appropriate legislation and regulations to build capacity, train local people, provide information, and carry out real field research to test new approaches to manage resources in the most efficient way.

I think we [have been] able to help our members more effectively and do more in the way of training and capacity building. I also hope we can develop bamboo and rattan as vehicles for sustainable development with our member countries around the world, especially in the Global South.

IPS: What are the prospects for Africa's bamboo and rattan industry?

DHF: The recorded statistics say that Africa has about three and half million hectares of bamboo, which excludes conservation [areas].

So, if I were to make a guess, Africa has as much bamboo as China [excluding China's natural forests] and that means theoretically, we should have the possibility of creating an industry as large as China's in Africa. That means an industry of 30 billion dollars per a year employing 10 million people.

IPS: How is INBAR helping to develop such a huge potential in Africa?

DHF: The returns we are seeing in China may not happen overnight in Africa, China has had 30 to 40 years to develop this industry.

But what we are doing is working with our members in Africa to kick off the bamboo value chain to start businesses and help members make the most out of these plants.

IPS: Working with countries from the global south means replication of best practices and knowledge sharing among member states. Are there any good examples worth mentioning?

DHF: China is the world's leading country when it comes to the production and management of bamboo so we have a lot to learn from China. Fortunately China has the financial resources that makes it easy to share that information and knowledge with our members ... Looking at land management activities in Ghana, as an example, I think bamboo can really help in restoring lands that have been damaged through illegal mining activities.

Maybe that is actually where we can learn from other African countries because we are already looking at how bamboo can help with the restoration of degraded lands in Ethiopia.

Also, when we had a training workshop in Cameroon last year and we looked at architecture, we brought an architect from Peru who shared his experience of working with bamboo in Latin America, which was quite applicable to Cameroon. So we are using experience from different parts of the world to help others develop what they think is important.

IPS: What is the most important thing in the development of the bamboo and rattan value chain for an African country like Ghana?

DHF: There are a number of things that we can do. One area that Ghana is already working on with regards to bamboo and rattan, is furniture production. I know that there is fantastic work being done with skills development.

The value chain of furniture production is an area where Ghana already has a lot to offer. But if we can improve quality, if we can make the furniture more interesting for consumers, through skills training [of artisans], then that is an area where we can really help.

IPS: Which other opportunity can Ghana look at exploring in the area of Bamboo and Rattan value chain?

DHF: Another area of opportunity is to use bamboo as a source of charcoal for household energy. People depend on charcoal, especially in rural areas in Ghana, but most of the charcoal comes from often illegally-cut trees.

Instead of cutting trees we can simply harvest bamboo and make charcoal from this, which is a legally produced source.

The great thing about Bamboo is that it re-grows the following growing season after harvesting, so it is a very sustainable source of charcoal production.

IPS: What does the future look like for INBAR?

DHF: Two months ago Beijing hosted the China Africa Forum and we were very, very pleased to have read that the draft programme of work actually includes the development of Africa's bamboo industry. There is a paragraph that says China and Africa will work together to establish an African training centre.

We understand this will most likely be in Ethiopia and it will happen hopefully in the coming years.

Another thing is that China and Africa will work closely together to develop the bamboo and rattan industry. They will also develop specific activities on how to use bamboo for land restoration and climate change mitigation and to see how bamboo can help with livelihood development in Africa in partnership with China.

This is a very exciting development, a new window of opportunity has opened for us to work together to develop bamboo and rattan in Africa.

HD 	Why the World Bank's Optimism About Global Poverty Misses the Point

The World Bank's latest annual report on poverty and shared prosperity has an unsurprisingly positive message that only 10% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty in 2015, which is the most recent year that available data allows for global poverty estimates to be made.

As World Bank President Jim Yong Kim points out in the foreword to the report, this is "the lowest poverty rate in recorded history".

TD 
	

This is a story that we have become accustomed to hearing from the Bank, and other significant participants in the debate about poverty and development in the global South (Asia, Africa, and Latin America). But does the story actually hold true? For example, the World Bank measures extreme poverty in terms of the number of people who live on less than USD$1.90 a day. But is this in fact a meaningful measurement of poverty?

World Bank poverty estimates have come in for a lot of criticism. For example, Jason Hickel, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics, has pointed out that there's often a large gap between national poverty lines and the international poverty line stipulated by the bank.

For example, more than 55% of South Africa's population lives below the country's upper poverty line, of R1,138 (USD$80) a month. But, according to the World Bank, only 18.85% of the South African population lives in poverty. This suggests that the international poverty lined touted by the World Bank systematically underestimates the extent of global poverty.

This point is partially acknowledged in this year's report. Accordingly, the World Bank proposes new and higher poverty lines - USD$3.20 and USD$5.50 a day, respectively. According to the report, almost half the world's population lives below the USD $5.50 a day poverty line. However, we need to go further than this - indeed, the World Bank's widely touted story of historically low poverty levels must be rejected.

If we are to have a serious debate about world poverty on End Poverty Day, we have to start by acknowledging that the global problem of poverty is far more extensive than World Bank rhetoric would have us believe. Two big factors need to be confronted. The first is that the majority of the world's poor live in countries that have experienced strong economic growth. The second is that the growth strategies these countries have practised create and reproduce poverty.

Unequal distribution

The World Bank attributes the supposed historical decline in poverty in large part to the rising wealth of several Asian countries. But, this is a problematic argument. In his recent book Global Poverty, development economist Andy Sumner shows how a new geography of poverty has emerged in the global South.

Whether we use monetary estimates - Sumner uses a poverty line of $2.50 a day - or estimates of multidimensional poverty; that is, poverty measured according to health indicators, education levels, and economic standards of living - as many as 70% of the world's poor currently live in what the World Bank refers to as middle-income countries.

As Sumner points out, poverty in middle-income countries cannot be attributed to an absolute lack of resources. These are countries that have experienced strong economic growth since the 1990s. What it boils down to in middle-income countries like India,Nigeria, and Brazil is the issue of distribution.

The economic growth that has lifted countries from low-income status to middle-income status is profoundly unequally distributed. As a result, large parts of the populations in these countries are excluded from the benefits that accrue from this growth.

This in turn has implications for how we think about growth strategies and poverty reduction in the global South.

Global growth and development

Much of the economic growth that has lifted countries from low-income status to middle-income status has resulted from the emergence of global production networks and global value chains since the late 1970s. Poorer countries have been integrated into these networks in large part due to their large reservoirs of cheap labour. It is this process of industrialisation that has turned low-income countries into middle-income countries.

But if global production networks come with so many developmental benefits, why is it that world poverty is concentrated in countries that have experienced economic growth precisely because they are integrated in these networks? To understand this paradox, it is important to remember that global production networks are comprised of different value tiers, and that different countries and different groups capture different amounts of the value that is created in these networks.

This obviously leads to a reproduction of inequality - countries in the global South tend to be integrated in lower value tiers.

This is evident in the fact that the distribution of national incomes and wealth at a world scale is still characterised by a pronounced North-South hierarchy. But it is more important still to be aware that countries in the global South that have witnessed strong economic growth have also experienced marked escalations in national levels of inequality. In India in 2016, for example, the richest 10% of the population received 55% of all income. This is an increase of more than 20% since 1980.

This pattern of development clearly shows how poverty is a matter of distribution that is related to the kind of employment opportunities that are created when southern countries are embedded in global value chains. The factory jobs that are established when transnational corporations set up shop in countries like Mexico or Vietnam are fundamentally precarious. And it is precarious workers who capture the least of the value that is created in global production networks. This is why precarious workers live in poverty in middle-income countries in the global South.

What's clear from this is that we have to ask ourselves what a development policy based on redistribution in favour of the working classes in the global South might look like - because that, ultimately, is the key to ending poverty in an unequal world.

Address by Deputy Minister Buti Manamela at the UNISA Conference on Decolonising Knowledge, Teaching and Learning In Higher Education, University of South Africa (UNISA), Pretoria

Programme Director

Vice Chancellor of UNISA - Prof Mandla Makhanya

Keynote Speaker - Prof Kwesi Prah

Distinguished academics

The subject of decolonisation of higher education has been at the centre of numerous discourses, student and academic protests and intense dialogue and debate in post - apartheid South Africa.

South Africa, like the Global South, possesses higher education institutions with direct and deep roots in colonialism and racism that are challenging existing structures and invoking indigenization, diversification, depatriachalization, decolonisation and democratisation.

Comparative insights and experiences of change in the higher education sector across the Global South are important at this time.

Therefore this conference is important for the higher education sector as a whole Decolonisation is commonly understood as the undoing of colonialism.

It entails the process whereby colonised people rediscover and recover their own history, culture, language and identity.

It is when colonised people invoke their histories, worldviews, and indigenous knowledge systems to theorise and imagine alternative possibilities, including a different curriculum.

Decolonisation is a necessary response to first and second generation colonialism, neo-colonialism and neoliberalism.

First generation colonialism was the conquering of the physical spaces and bodies of the colonised, whilst second generation colonialism was involved with the colonisation of the mind through disciplines, such as education, science, economics and law.

Neo-colonialism relates to the achievement of technical independence by a country, but that is still under the influence of ex-colonial country.

The first President of independent Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, argued that neo-colonialism is a more insidious form of colonialism because it is more difficult to detect.

It also involves new-elites who were trained by colonialists and that take on the roles of colonialists in countries, post-independence.

In the context of South African higher education, decolonisation is the comprehensive transformation or change of the curriculum and institutional cultures to primarily reflect and promote African context.

It signifies the process of effecting meaningful change in the academic, social, economic, demographic, political and cultural domains of institutional life. It relates to discarding what has been wrongly written, and interrogating distortions of people's life experiences, negative labelling, deficit theorising, genetically deficient or culturally deficient models that pathologised the colonised.

It involves retelling the stories of the past and envisioning the future.

It is about self-determination and social justice for those who have been marginalised by the Western academy and about seeking legitimacy for knowledge that is embedded in their own histories, experiences and ways of viewing reality.

It is about the formulation, legislation and dissemination of ethical issues related to the protection of indigenous knowledge systems.

Decolonisation accentuates the importance of teaching/learning in indigenous languages as part of the anti-imperialist struggle.

It relates to international scholars sharing common experiences, issues and struggles of colonised people in global and local spaces.

It is also concerned with a critical appraisal of the imperial model of the academy that continues to deny the colonised and historically marginalised other spaces to communicate from their own frames of reference.

Since inception, all South African universities adopted Western models of academic organisation which largely excluded and decimated the knowledge of black people.

The colonial model of academic organisation of the university, based on Western disciplinary knowledge, was entrenched during apartheid and has not been sufficiently transformed in post-apartheid era.

Although student demographics at South African universities, particularly in historically predominantly white universities, changed significantly, staff demographics have not changed in accordance.

This has ensured the preservation of colonial academic organisation, including curricula.

These colonial academic organisations also include historical legacies of capitalism, racism and patriarchy as intrinsic to institutional cultures and practices in Universities.

Recent events surrounding the #RhodesMustFall campaign have reinvigorated the need to transform these prevailing colonial academic organisations and to create African universities located in a national and regional context that centres the African and African knowledge and practices as vital to human relationships and growth.

The #RhodesMustFall campaign was not just about a statue but about the need to decolonise the institutional culture and practices of the university more broadly.

There is an urgent need to create new kind of academic institutions with new kind of public spaces premised on Constitutional principles of human dignity and equality.

Decolonising the university starts with the de-privatisation and rehabilitation of the public spaces.

It starts with a redefinition of what is public, i.e., what pertains to the realm of the common and as such, does not belong to anyone in particular because it must be equally shared between equals.

The decolonisation of buildings and public spaces includes a change of those colonial names, iconography, i.e., the economy of symbols whose function, all along, has been to induce and normalise particular states of humiliation based on white supremacist presuppositions.

Such names, images and symbols have nothing to do on the walls of a public university campus more than 20 years into a democratic dispensation.

The biggest question when it comes to these issues is whether in their current form, they are relevant for the massive expansion of higher education in South Africa, which has opened up to students across race and class lines.

Some, if not many of these students don't fit the profile of the typical rich and middle class, white, "university-ready" 18-year-old school leavers, but are students from rural and historically disadvantaged backgrounds, young adults some with families and responsibilities already, not so good basic education results, etc.

The involvement of students and the prospective employers is an issue of concern that universities need to consider when developing the curriculum, teaching and research methods.

For example, it is common knowledge that curriculum content is predominantly western, capitalist, heterosexual and dominated by European worldviews in South Africa.

It is necessary therefore that the content is changed to include the perspectives, experiences and epistemologies of Africa.

A clear strategy to tackle the issue of decolonisation of the curriculum, teaching and research needs to be developed.

It is clear that this will need different kinds of resources and expertise.

The unequal distribution of resources in higher education further compounds this predicament.

Serious consideration of a strong focus on rectifying this is necessary.

The risk of not having a clear strategy is that higher education will look no different 10 years down the line than what it is currently.

The Western model of academic organisation on which the South African university is based, remains largely unchallenged.

One way of challenging it is to ask bold and controversial questions and have continuous engagements to try and come up with answers.

Decolonisation involves fundamental rethinking and reframing of the curriculum and bringing South Africa and Africa to the centre of teaching, learning and research.

It's time for Africa to tell its own stories in university classrooms.

Everyone, academics, students, workers, government officials, parents, business, the community and many more must come on board to ensure the success of reviewing and rethinking the curriculum to get to curriculum that incorporates epistemic perspectives, knowledge and thinking from the African continent and the global South into their teaching, research and community engagement.

So this is not to isolate South African universities from the rest of the world.

South African universities enjoy autonomy in a wide range of areas including the nature of the curriculum, teaching and research.

However, they have to be responsive to the constituencies they serve if they are to be relevant.

Efforts to decolonise the curriculum, teaching and focus of research must therefore be undertaken at institutional level and with the involvement of the range of university constituencies including students for whom curriculum, teaching and research is primarily intended.

There are already a range of meaningful curriculum reform, teaching support and research development initiatives underway in most universities.

From the perspective of the Department of Higher Education and Training (the Department) these initiatives are supported by the University Capacity Development Programme (UCDP), the Department's flagship programme to transform teaching, learning, researching and leading towards enhanced quality, success and equity in universities.

The programme formally started in January 2018, although first steps were taken much earlier.

Teaching and research development at universities are key components of the UCDP and a range of programmes have been conceptualised and are being implemented to build capacity in these areas.

The UCDP is intended to enable an integrated approach to capacity development across three focus areas, namely: i) student development; ii) staff development and iii) programme/curriculum development.

The budget allocation for the UCDP is almost R1 billion for the 2018 academic year.

The first comprehensive component of the University Capacity Development Programme - the New Generation of Academics Programme (nGAP) has gone from strength to strength, and is now a well-regarded capacity development programme in the sector that is making a difference.

Thus far, a total of 373 nGAP posts have been allocated to universities.

Over 80% of the posts are held by Black and/or women academics.

From 2018 onwards, and as part of the UCDP, a minimum of 100 new nGAP posts will be made available.

The nGAP serves to recruit new academics which we hope will contribute to the issues of decolonisation.

The University Staff Doctoral Programme follows on from the nGAP and it is intended to support existing academics to achieve doctoral degrees.

The USDP was initiated as part of the Staffing South Africa's Universities Framework (SSAUF) component of the UCDP.

The main purpose of the USDP is to support academics at South African universities to achieve doctoral degrees.

A secondary purpose is to build supervisory capacity at South African universities.

A third purpose is to promote collaboration between South African and international universities.

All these programmes will, in one way or the other, have an influence in the debate around decolonisation.

Through the UCDP, universities are also implementing programmes on decolonisation of the curriculum under the component of Programme/Curriculumn development.

Universities started with the implementation of these programmes early 2018.

Progress in their implementation will be monitored as we expect to learn some useful lessons that will contribute to the discourse of decolonisation.

There are many debates around decolonisation of higher education, including some voices that vociferously maintain that the debate is irrelevant and that the focus should be on increasing throughput and graduation rates.

There is work being done at an institutional level and through the various initiatives of the DHET, as I earlier outlined.

But there is more that we can do.

This conference must contribute to the change agenda of decolonising higher education.

It must reflect on what is being done and assess where the gaps are.

It must propose new initiatives at an institutional and national level.

And finally, it must give further impetus to continuing the fight for decolonised knowledge, teaching and learning in higher education in South Africa and beyond.

I thank you.

Public lecture by Deputy Minister Reginah Mhaule on the Outcomes of the 10th BRICS Johannesburg Summit at the Sol Plaatjie University, Kimberley, Northern Cape, 19 September 2018

Our Programme Director, Prof Mary Jean Baxen,

TD 
	

Prof Collin Miruka,

Prof Patrick Fitzgerald,

Members of Senate and Council present,

MEC of Education, Ms Barbara Bartlett and other members of Exco present,

Academics and Staff,

Provincial Chairperson of the ANC, Dr Zamani Saul, the leadership and all other political parties present,

President of SRC, Mr Zolani Jack, Members of the SRC and the entire student leadership present,

Students,

Officials present here,

Esteemed guests,

Sanibonani.

I am honoured and of course delighted to interact with you today, particularly because of our focus of engagement which is the outcomes of the recently concluded 10th BRICS Summit which was held in Johannesburg in July this year. You will recall that before the commencement of the Summit, we criss-crossed the length and breadth of our country presenting and informing our people what our partnership within the BRICS entails. We further focused on ensuring that South Africans understands the importance we attach to the BRICS formation and the benefits we derive thereof.

In this context we made a commitment to get back to the people and report on the outcomes of the Summit. Certainly this is our first public lecture of this kind which is held at the university named after the first Secretary General of the South African Native National Congress, later named African National Congress (ANC) and also the first Black South African to write a novel, Solomon Tshekisho Plaatje.

The summit took place during the 10th anniversary of the BRICS formation which coincided with a very significant year where South Africa celebrates the centenary of the two giants in our liberation, namely Mama Albertina Sisulu and former President Tata Nelson Mandela. Whose contribution shape our current democratic dispensation and internationalist character.

The Summit indeed afforded us a fitting platform to again reflect on the important pillars of our foreign policy, particularly our cooperation with countries of the South. Tata Madiba alluded to this in his inaugural State of the Nation Address (SONA) on 24 May 1994 when he said: "We will also be looking very closely at the question of enhancing South-South cooperation in general as part of the effort to expand our economic links with the rest of the world."

I can inform you that it is in this context that South Africa accepted the invitation to join BRICS in 2011. We believe that economic cooperation remains an important instrument to pursue our national interests and improve the living conditions of our people while contributing to the well-being of our fellow Africans and all those in communities across our nations.

Having said that, I would like to take an opportunity to briefly reflect on the history of our membership to the BRICS formation before outlining the outcomes of the summit and the benefits we have leveraged from the opportunities it continues to provide.

Ladies and gentlemen,

It must be public knowledge that our foreign policy outlook and continued focus on strengthening relations with formations and people of the South is largely informed by our history as well as identity. We however must emphasise that we are Africans who share historic commonalities with countries of the Global South which includes amongst others, the struggle against apartheid and colonialism. We also share common aspirations in regard to the kind of the world we wish to live in and the shared future which can benefit humanity.

Similarly, the BRICS formation in this context signifies a long standing tradition of solidarity that was firmly established 63 years ago, in April 1955. This was when countries of Asia and Africa met at the historic Bandung Conference in the emerging Cold War era situation of which the meeting's significance and outcomes are well documented. I must however remind you that the Bandung Conference resulted in the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in later years.

Amid pressure from the Cold War bipolarisation, those countries were able to concertedly affirm that they would choose neither the East nor the West, but pursue their own path and strategy under the "Bandung Principles" of the Afro-Asia solidarity. For us it is important to recall that South Africa was at the Bandung Conference, represented by selected ANC leaders.

Subsequently, with the attainment of our democracy, it is again common knowledge that South Africa shared the same socio-economic and underdeveloped challenges as countries of the Global South. To a certain extent our challenges continue to be compounded by an international system that perpetuates the marginalisation of the Global South and the poor in every corner of the globe.

The BRICS formation has demonstrated potential to change the world. This is possible considering that the BRICS formation has joined an array of inter-regional bodies that contribute to global diffusion of power. Of course we joined the BRICS formation to advance our foreign policy objectives that are predicated on our domestic interests and the promotion of the African Agenda.

Esteemed guests,

We can, once again, underscore that our 2018 Chairship of the BRICS Forum has been guided by our commitment to ensure that the African Agenda, as well as that of the Global South, remain on the Agenda of BRICS, particularly as it relates to garnering BRICS support for industrialisation and infrastructure development. We have sought to harmonise policies adopted in regional and international fora with those pursued in BRICS, more notably the African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The benefits that South Africa and the African derive from our membership of the BRICS are both practical and tangible. A case in point is that South Africa-BRIC trade has grown from $28bn in 2010 to $35bn in 2017.

Additionally the establishment and operalisation of the BRICS New Development Bank as well as the Africa Regional Centre (ARC), which we proudly host in Johannesburg, has brought closer the alternative project funding institution to our people and the continent.

Just as a reminder, infrastructure and sustainable development project funding by the BRICS bank will also be extended to countries that are not members of the formation, and therefore African countries will benefit a great deal. I can say without any fear of contradiction that the ARC will enable us to identify projects that will enhance economic connectivity and bolster intra-Africa trade, among others.

It must further be noted that we witnessed with pride the first tranche of NDB project loans disbursed in 2016. I recall that this trench included a project in renewable energy amounting to 180 million USD to our own country. This has enabled us to stabilise our electricity grid supply and keep the much-needed jobs through continued operations in factories. There are those who are already saying the NDB could be the new World Bank, as far as I know this was not the objective of its creation. In May 2018 South Africa was granted an additional loan of USD 200 million by the NDB for expansion of the Durban port. It is worth noting that thus far the NDB has disbursed loans totalling USD 5.1 billion.

Programme Director,

Let me at this juncture turn my focus to some specific outcomes of the 2018 10th BRICS Summit. South Africa in its capacity as Chair of the BRICS grouping hosted the Johannesburg Summit on the 25-27 July 2018, in Sandton, Johannesburg, under the theme, "BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution".

President Ramaphosa in his opening address to the Summit expanded on the theme, further stating, quantum leaps in technology and innovation present enormous opportunities for growth, development and human progress.The president also indicated that the surge in innovation has the potential to dramatically improve productivity and to place entire countries on a new trajectory of prosperity. It has the potential to solve many of the social problems we face, by better equipping us to combat disease, hunger and environmental degradation.

Esteemed guests,

A report by the World Economic Forum predicts that by 2020, which is roughly two years from now, three most important skills for an employee will be complex problem-solving, critical thinking and creativity. Admittedly this require emerging markets to institute innovative programmes to re-skill the current workforce to be able to match the advances in technology. This of course will be achieved within the context of BRICS and also in cooperation with other formation across the globe.

In line with the theme, we informed our guests that, as a country, we have already committed to establish a Digital Industrial Revolution Commission. It will include the private sector and civil society, among others. In this regard, the BRICS Summit has adopted the Johannesburg declaration and an Action Plan based on this thematic focus and other pressing international issues. The BRICS Heads of State also presided over the signing of a couple of memorandums of understanding.

During deliberations of the Annual Meeting of the BRICS Business Council, we recognised the achievements and progress the Council had made over the past year and analysed the opportunities and challenges facing the emerging economies. The five BRICS countries reinforced their ongoing commitment and agreed on the importance of ensuring greater economic, trade and investment ties amongst the BRICS countries.

The three major focus areas identified during South Africa's BRICS Business Council's rotating chairmanship were: 1. Youth - Fostering Entrepreneurship 2. The Digital Economy - Skills Development for the 4th Industrial Revolution 3. Agriculture and Food Security

Perhaps I must state that, flowing from the above and our commitment to the Establishment of the BRICS Credit Rating Agency, there is growing global interests in how we manage the BRICS affairs. Just a few week ago, two of the 'Big Three' rating agencies has given the BRICS New Development Bank positive ratings, Standard & Poor's (S&P) has assigned its AA+ long-term and A1+ short-term issuer ratings with a stable outlook while Fitch assigned the NDB a long-term issuer default rating (IDR) of AA+ with a stable outlook and a short-term IDR of F1+. This is a positive development in that it provides the NDB with a unique opportunity to establish itself as an important player in the multilateral development finance space. This further negates the perception of naysayers that the BRICS grouping lacks the required clout to influence global power dynamics.

Also, the Council reviewed the major work and achievements during South Africa's presidency in 2018 and listened to the reports presented by the nine working groups, on energy and the green economy, financial services, deregulation, manufacturing, infrastructure, agribusiness, skills development, regional aviation and the digital economy.

Further moves towards enhancing economic development came in the form of the establishment of a BRICS Tourism Track and the BRICS Women's Initiative.

On a separate matter, a proposal was made to the Summit, arising from deliberations from the 2018 BRICS Youth Summit, to consider the establishment of a Youth Working Group, as the 10th Working Group of the Council. This matter is receiving the attention it deserves.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me underscore that all the BRICS partners utilised the summit occasion to recommit to the pursuit of a rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system, as embodied in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Importantly, this commitment of the BRICS Leaders was also strongly supported by the BRICS Outreach partners.

This brings me to an important aspect of our hosting. We convened, on the margins of the summit, the BRICS-Africa Outreach Dialogue and the BRICS Plus Initiative. Thus the following Heads of State/Government attended the Summit: Rwanda, Ethiopia, Angola, Zambia, Namibia, Senegal, Gabon, Togo, Uganda, Jamaica, Argentina, Turkey, Botswana, DRC, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Tanzania and Zimbabwe

I must indicate that both the Outreach Dialogue and the Initiative were held simultaneously to reflect the broad partnerships BRICS has stimulated with the African continent and the Global South.

Key outcomes of the Johannesburg Declaration, included amongst others: establishment of a BRICS Working Group on the 4th Industrial Revolution through the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution (PartNIR) and its Advisory Group consisting of respective representatives of BRICS Ministries of Industry; BRICS Networks of Science Parks, Technology Business Incubators and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises were established to further support initiatives of the 4th Industrial Revolution; BRICS Vaccine Centre was established here in South Africa.

The declaration, which was reached to the principles of consensus further committed to the principals of mutual respects, sovereignty, equality, democracy, inclusiveness and strengthened collaboration in key subthemes; namely: Strengthening multilateralism, reforming global governance and addressing common challenges; Strengthening and consolidation BRICS cooperation in International peace and Security; BRICS partnership for global economic recovery, reform of financial and economic global governance institutions, and the Forth Industrial Revolution; and People to People Cooperation.

Ladies and gentlemen,

In conclusion, allow me to turn my attention to education as a matter that received a focused attention of the summit. Our leaders agreed that there is a need to develop an outcome based education that will assist us in meeting the developmental challenges brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this vein the BRICS Heads of State/Governments reaffirmed the importance of higher education exchange for BRICS and called for a network of universities across the BRICS countries to collaborate and exchange knowledge and research experience.

Again, I am alluding to this so that the Institution we visiting today, knows that it also has a role to play in the development of the BRICS educational Programme. The BRICS University Network is therefore an important structure that will undertake the research that is needed to inform the overall BRICS collaboration and how it must evolve.

There are pockets of excellence in all our universities and our goal should be to benefit all.

Ngiyabonga!!!

HD 	North-South Research Partnerships Must Break Old Patterns for Real Change

Since the 1940s major world powers like the US, the UK and the United Nations have made moves to spread their scientific, economic, industrial, and human rights progress to countries and regions that are seen as less developed, vulnerable or deprived in one way or another.

This has taken the form of a substantial, varied - and largely well-intentioned - contribution of huge financial and human resources from the global north to the global south. Today the flow of aid money, resources, and increasing global morality and mobility is building ever broader pipelines between these different regions.

TD 
	

And yet from where we stand as individual researchers, with funding and passion to share, we see an unsettling and consistent characteristic of this development history. The global north has experienced a gradual increase of economic strength and environmental protection, through jobs, career development, cheap goods and services.

Meanwhile, the global south has undergone a sustained degradation of autonomy, fertile land, food security and cultural literacies. All this has occurred through an imposition of foreign ideas, materials, ideologies and knowledge systems.

Despite all the good intentions, and the promises and provision of funding and expertise, global challenges persist and in some cases, have increased. As academics in social justice research, we are working in relation to a world of increasing social fragmentation and ecological vulnerability. This is happening "on our watch"; at the hands of our methods and practices and paradigms of research and professional practice.

That's why we're trying to do things differently. The Sustainable Futures in Africa Network, funded by the Global Challenges Research Fund, was formed in 2016. Our aim is to resist becoming another project within this trajectory of north to south research and development. We're working to resist "business-as-usual". The network has hubs in Nigeria, Uganda, Botswana, Malawi and the UK.

What we're doing is taking a completely different approach to research by ditching old techniques and approaches and breaking research moulds that have become entrenched over the past eight decades. For example, we're pioneering ways of engaging with communities that allow them to contribute their traditional knowledge and co-design the research agenda.

Our practices allow us to genuinely and ethically communicate and collaborate with communities, colleagues, and stakeholders. This is especially crucial when it comes to different knowledge systems. For example, in Nigeria soil scientists are engaging with spiritual beliefs that inform communities of the meaning of gold found in their soil. These ideas conflict with what is known in terms of Western science, and yet they serve a real purpose, have real impacts, and are "true" and "factful" to the communities that live according to such beliefs.

Different approaches are imperative if development initiatives are to buck the worrying trends that have cemented inequality and lessened sustainability.

How we work

Collaboration between the global north and global south too often follows a tick-box approach. A named global south partner ticks a box to indicate that a project is complying with Official Development Assistance criteria. A local translator ticks a box to indicate that local people are being consulted. A meeting in the country of a Southern partner indicates that the work must be collaborative in nature.

Typically the results will confirm the (Northern) "expert's" hypothesis and support monocultures of the mind. What should be true collaboration, then, results in everyone thinking the same way.

Much formal funded research conducted in the name of development and social justice begins with the great promise of expertise and resources. This merely serves the validation and purpose of the "expert", a person who is typically from the global north or a university setting.

We do things differently. We begin by acknowledging our own implications in the issues we address: we ask how our own practices, assumptions and behaviours contribute to the very inequities and issues we seek to improve. We prioritise creating a safe and honest common ground where new knowledges can be shared and new solutions can be co-designed.

For example, in Uganda we engaged in fieldwork to study water and food security issues using a "no method" approach with no predetermined research design. This meant no questionnaire or sampling technique. Instead the team spent time with families in their homes, listened to them and allowed the communities to direct the research enquiry.

Our ideas and expectations were confounded. The extreme problems these communities faced were largely due to the misplaced aid and intervention of previous projects. By listening, and bringing our own knowledge to the table, we were able to understand these communities as complex spaces of social, cultural and ecological needs.

Another difference lies in the way the network shares insights with its stakeholders. There are no shiny reports crammed with tables and graphs, sent to external offices so that a box is ticked. Rather, policy makers, researchers, and community members are brought together in common spaces - such as a community hall constructed entirely from recycled plastic water bottles and a timber frame in an urban slum in Kampala - so they can engage differently with the factors, people and places at play in a given issue.

Change is crucial

These experiences have proved to us that decisive changes to the traditional methodologies of collaboration are necessary. Without change, the trajectory of growth and development in the world will remain consistent with what's happened over the past 80 years: the north will keep getting richer and the south, poorer. It's time to abandon well-trodden paths and forge new approaches.

HD 	Global South Scholars Are Missing From European and U.S. Journals. What Can Be Done About It

Studies have shown that scholars in the global South are under represented in top international peer-reviewed social and medical sciences journals.

The global South refers to African, Asian, Latin American, and Middle Eastern countries who are also members of the Group of 77. The intergovernmental organisation of mainly developing countries is used to identify countries in the South. The global North includes the Group of 8 and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.

TD 
	

Our own analysis of gender and politics journals shows scholars in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are missing from leading journals published in the US and Europe. We found that between 2008 and 2017 less than 3% of 947 full length articles in four gender and politics journals published in the global North were written by scholars based in the global South.

Researchers based in the global North have a wider global reach and are generally judged to be at the forefront of knowledge production and dissemination. Meanwhile, South-based scholars are often not part of major debates and conversations in their field. This points to a severe imbalance in the production of new knowledge.

But all countries in the South are not alike. We found that scholars at three universities in South Africa (Rhodes University, University of Cape Town, and the University of the Witwatersrand) published the most articles followed by researchers at four universities in India. Surprisingly, scholars from large countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Nigeria have not published articles in these journals.

The causes of this under-representation are many. In Africa, where we both conduct research, it has been attributed to factors such as poor funding for universities, heavy teaching loads, and the incentives faculty face; many universities do not adequately reward research.

But it's more than institutional constraints that contribute to the under-representation of scholars based in Africa and in other regions in the South. Even when South-based scholars publish in journals based in the North, they still remain on the periphery. Editorial board members continue to be overwhelmingly based in the North and articles published by Africa-based scholars are less likely to be cited and thus, generally don't have a major influence on the literature.

We argue that the exclusion of scholars based in the global South undermines the quality of scholarship and sends a negative message to students. But we also argue that there are solutions to the problem.

Undermining scholarship

An academy in which large groups are absent is one in which fewer research questions are asked and less diverse research tools used. For example, in the study of gender and politics, scholars based in the South have emphasised the importance of studying the effects of the global political and economic order on women's lives in the South. But this attention to the global order is often missing from studies of gender and politics in the global South.

Second, it signals to students, including students in the global South, that South-based scholars do not have a central role to play in knowledge production. This has implications for how students generally perceive and engage with scholarship that is produced in the global South.

Solutions

Myriad solutions have been proposed to address the under representation of scholars based in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.

In Africa, these include the need for institutions to remove barriers such as heavy teaching loads, poor infrastructure, and inadequate research funding, that make research and publishing a challenge for many scholars. African governments have to invest in African universities and to implement policies that facilitate research.

The global academic community also has a role to play. Editors should invite contributions from scholars who might not normally submit papers to these journals. And journal editors can invite scholars based in the global South to join editorial boards and to edit journals.

Among other things, the presence of editors and editorial board members in the global South will make it easier to identify promising research.

Another intervention is that research organisations should provide funding to scholars in the South to help give them space to develop their ideas and receive feedback from their peers. Organisations such as the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) and the American Political Science Association (APSA) have made some progress in this area. CODESRIA has provided research funding and APSA-Africa Workshops have been forums where African scholars gathered to share and receive feedback on their research from their peers.

While, in general, financial support is limited and may be on the decline, public agencies and private foundations still have the choice in where and how to allocate their funds.

Colleagues

Esteemed delegates

Ladies and gentlemen,

It is an honour for me to be afforded this opportunity to engage with you on this occasion of South Africa's membership of the BRICS formation. South Africa will be hosting the BRICS Summit in July 2018, at the time this formation marks its 20 year anniversary which coincides with the commemoration of the centenary of Nelson Mandela who would have turned 100 this year had he lived longer. I would not leave out the fact that we also commemorate the centenary of another icon of the South African liberation struggle Mama Albertina Sisulu.

Both Tata Madiba and Mama Sisulu have contributed immensely on laying the foundation of an independent and democratic foreign policy which we continue to implement.

As we have heard about the BRICS formation and our country's membership to it, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa represents one of the most significant developments in global government and this is a bloc that brings together sufficiently great members of emerging powers that are designed to take significant international decision and in the negotiations of major global affairs.

This countries are joined together by a strong desire to change the world system with the purpose of reflecting the diversity of the world power, economies, culture and the societies in general.

Programme Director,

Allow me to contextualise the South Africa's membership of the BRICS formation for the benefit of all our stakeholders by quoting our Leader Nelson Mandela's words at the world economic forum Southern Africa summit in 1994, when he said " this is our collective achievement which has opened up new opportunities for us to exploit our great potential and indeed to boldly cross the threshold of a new and great era."

The formation of BRICS by the emerging powers has attracted significant academic interest which resulted into a significant growth in literature on the subject.

BRICS represents 43 percent of the world's population and that triggered academic interest in understanding the political, economic, social, scientific and technological importance of the figuration of the world power, both its potentials and its weaknesses.

As a result different BRICS forums were established such as the academic forum, business forum, the young diplomatic forum and others.

Former President Mandela, in his capacity as our Head of State and Government, championed the strengthening of regional and international economic cooperation to ensure that we leverage the existing and new opportunities while adhering to our international obligations. In 2011 when our Country was invited to join the then BRIC formation, South Africa favourably considered the invite because it is in line with the vision of our forefathers, which is the strengthening of international economic cooperation for mutual benefit as already stated above.

South Africa is not in the BRICS for its own sake, and perhaps for selfish consideration only, but is there to advance the interest and aspirations of Africa, the Global South and humanity at large.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I must also take this opportunity to briefly reflect on the genesis of our solidarity with countries of the South so that we can properly locate the BRICS formation in this regard. 63 years ago, in April 1955, countries of Asia and Africa met at the historic Bandung Conference to determine their common position amid the fast emerging Cold War bi-polarisation.

South Africa was represented, among others, by none other than Moses Kotane and Maulvi Cachalia. This is where the present day Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was conceived.

Your Excellencies,

I hope that this brief background will enhance our collective comprehension of the locus of BRICS in South Africa's foreign policy. I know that in some quotas our membership of the BRICS formation was and continues to be deliberately misrepresented as a negation of our relations with the development partners of the North. It is wrongly perceived as a deviation from our founding foreign policy principle. We have stated so many times that this formation must be regarded as a complimentary mechanism and is based on our founding principles and foreign policy pillars.

I must therefore urge everybody to work hard so that this formation is construed truly for what it stands for.

Of course the BRICS formation was bound to tilt the balances of forces at global level considering that we, among others, collectively produce a third of the world's industrial products and one half of agricultural goods. During its infantry stages, researches estimated that the BRICS will dominate the world by 2050, however the revised projections indicates that this could happen as early as 2027.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Distractors of the BRICS thought and communicated that this would be another talk show with no tangible deliverables. We can however agree that it is a force to be reckoned with in the international arena and has contributed to increased dispersal of global political and economic power. I must state that the progress that has been recorded thus far is due to our collective commitment to see through the implementation of all our decisions which are always based on consensus.

Brand SA in its recent Research Report titled: - "The BRICS brand: from economic concept to institution of global governance", indicates that between the years 2009 and 2017 BRICS Summits made a total of 406 summit declarations. Brand SA further informs us that 70% of summit decisions have been implemented to date.

They further indicate that, in an effort to deepen and widen cooperation and collaboration, the BRICS formation has convened approximately 160 meetings at different levels, convened by Ministers of trade, finance, foreign affairs, health, agriculture, statistical authorities, and competition commissions which led to the adoption of 60 documents which in turn is giving effect to working groups, contact groups and related platforms to coordinate activities.

I urge you to read this entire report because it is an important yard stick to measure the success of the BRICS formation of which we are proud of.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We therefore seek to build on the already recorded achievement and ensure that our chair ship increases support for Africa's development Agenda. We have an opportunity to leverage on the tectonic shift in global power dynamics and reassert ourselves as a united and renewed continent. This is what we are as the continent!!!

We are going to have a dedicated discussion during the Africa-Outreach meeting of selected Heads of State and government in the margins of the July Summit. I can assure you that building on the Durban 2013 out-reach approach, the 2018 Summit will produce practical steps to continue the BRICS support for the implementation of the African Union's Agenda 2063 through the BRICS.

This comes at a time when the continent has made great strides in pursuit of economically integrated Africa which promotes the movement of goods and services. As you may be aware the Continental Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) was signed in Rwanda in March this year and we continue with our national processes which will culminate in the country's accession to the agreement.

President Ramaphosa underscored the importance of an integrated African economy during the Japan-Africa Public-Private Economic Forum when he said;-

"For Africa to grow and for its people to flourish, its economies need to be more effectively integrated into the global economy".

Your Excellencies,

In this way we will be able to improve Intra-Africa trade and leverage more on the alternative funding that the BRICS New Development Bank provides for infrastructure development and sustainable development. The continent is already benefiting in this regard, particularly, in implementing the BRICS funded African Union (AU) North-South Development Corridor projects.

On our part we benefitted from the 2016 approved BRICS project funding when we were granted 180 million USD for renewable energy which helped us to stabilise our electricity grid during difficult times in this area. We have just been granted an additional loan of USD 200 million by the NDB in May 2018 for expansion of the Durban port. I must confess that for a newly established multilateral bank by developing nations to have disbursed loans totalling USD 5.1 billion by 2018 not be expected by many who expressed doubt during the establishment of the Bank.

Programme Director,

I also wish to reflect briefly on the concept of the BRICS Plus which was innovated by China in 2017. We wish to continue with this approach to ensure maximum synergy between our Chairship of BRICS and that of China. In this regard, South Africa has elected to invite the Leaders of the following countries representing Regional Economic Communities in the Global South and the United Nations namely:-

Argentina - as Chair of the G20 and influential Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) member

Indonesia - as Co-Chair of the New Africa-Asia Strategic Partnership with South Africa and influential Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member

Egypt - as Chair of the Group of 77 (G77) +China

Jamaica - as incoming Chair of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)

Turkey - as Chair of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)

United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, Mr Antonio Guterres

Together with my colleagues we have continued to highlight this approach to all our stakeholders and also inform them about the following newly identified areas of cooperation:-

Establishment of a Working Group on Peacekeeping;

Establishment of a Vaccine Research Centre for Collaboration with BRICS vaccine innovation and development partners - this is intended to be a physical research centre focused on research and development and vaccine innovation;

Establishment of a BRICS Gender and Women's Forum - intended as a dedicated track for gender and women's issues, given the economic benefit to be derived from the socio-economic empowerment of women, particularly in developing countries;

Leveraging the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership towards the pursuit of Inclusive Growth and Advancing the 4th Industrial Revolution - this is intended to foster discussions to addresses opportunities provided by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, as a means of leapfrogging development stages and bridging the digital divide; and

Establishment of a BRICS Tourism Track of Cooperation.

South Africa's approach to its Chairship is grounded in the intention to ensure programmatic continuity for BRICS, and committed to executing approximately 100 sectorial meetings, reflective of the expanded BRICS architecture. We also intend to bring a specific focus to the challenges and opportunities presented by the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Ladies and gentlemen,

It is my considered view that through this lecture we have a solid foundation for debating various elements of South Africa's membership of the BRICS. Am also certain that we will do so with a view to improve in areas that require such improvement but also ensure common and collective improved comprehension of the subject matter.

We must always remember the world we operate in and remain alive to the challenges we are facing as a continent, the Global South and humanity at large.

I thank you!

The Endorois community has been fighting for compensation ever since their unlawful removal from ancestral lands in the 1970s.

Four long decades since being illegally evicted from his ancestral homeland, Arap Yegon is still awaiting justice. A member of the Endorois community, the elder remembers being forcefully removed from the shores of Lake Bogoria and surrounding areas of Kenya's expansive Rift Valley in the 1970s. Yegon's family had lived there for generation upon generation, but the government wanted to create a game reserve for tourism.

TD 
	

"I felt very bitter when I learnt that a place I had called home throughout my life was now no longer my home," he says. Along with the Endorois community, he protested the move, but was then dealt a second blow. "I resisted the County Council's decision to forcefully evict us, but was unlawfully arrested and held in custody for 18 days."

The uprooted Endorois mobilised, but were consistently knocked back until 2010. In a landmark ruling, the African Commission Human and Peoples Rights declared that the community's eviction was illegal. It was as moment of triumph and optimism after a gruelling fight. Yet years later, Yegon is waiting once again. "I was happy that after a long struggle," he says. "However, I now regret, because despite having lost our land and livelihoods, we have not been compensated."

This latest waiting game has dragged on for nearly eight years now. But there may be a new glimmer of hope from an unlikely source. 12,000 km away in Colombia, indigenous people have faced similar challenges. They are now sharing their knowledge and experience with Kenyan campaigners as part of a broader movement of cooperation between human rights groups in the Global South and internationally.

The struggle

The Endorois had lived around Lake Bogoria and Muchongoi Forest in the Laikipia plains for generations. These areas provided a source of livelihood to this predominantly pastoral community and formed a crucial part of its identity. The land was a significant source of water and medicinal salt licks for livestock. It was a sacred site for religious and cultural rituals.

Between 1973 and 1978, however, the Kenya government forcefully evicted the Endorois. Without access to pasture, water and the medicinal salt licks on the edge of the lake, the community lost most of its livestock. The group was also left exposed to armed cattle rustlers from the Pokot community.

The government promised to relocate, compensate and build dams for the Endorois, but this never materialised. After several drawn out meetings, the government in 1986 finally paid out a mere Ksh 3,150 ($30) to about 170 families. Representatives from the community continued to fight and met twice with then President Daniel Arap Moi in the early 1990s. He ordered that they be compensated, but the government did not follow through.

This led the Endorois to seek justice through the judicial system. The Endorois Welfare Council filed a case at the High Court against Baringo and Koibaitek county councils, but it was dismissed in April 2002.

A landmark judgement

In 2003, the Endorois community turned to the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights. Through the Centre for Minority Rights, they filed a case against the Kenyan government challenging the lack of compensation, consultation, and protection accorded to them following their eviction.

On 2 February 2010, the Commission found in favour of the Endorois. The judges declared the group's removal illegal. They ruled that the Kenyan government had failed to recognise and protect the Endorois' ancestral land rights and that it had not provided sufficient compensation or alternative grazing land following the community's eviction. This was the first time an African indigenous community's rights over traditionally-owned land had been legally recognised.

The African Commission also found that Kenya was in violation of Articles 1, 8,14,17,21 and 22 of the African Charter. It made a raft of recommendations including that Kenya recognise the Endorois' rights of ownership; restore the ancestral land; ensure the community has unrestricted access to Lake Bogoria and surrounding sites; pay adequate compensation for losses suffered; and award royalties to the Endorois from existing economic activities. The Commission called on Kenya to engage in dialogue with the complainants to implement its recommendations and report back within three months.

Southern solidarity

Seven years later, however, and the Kenyan government has failed to implement the court's decisions.

This is partly what has encouraged the Endorois community to join forces with a number of organisations in Kenya, the Global South and beyond. The Kenyan Human Rights Commission (KHRC), Minority Rights Group International and the Economic Social and Cultural Rights Network (ESCR-Net) have all joined the Endorois Welfare Council. Together, they are advocating for the implementation of the African Commission's ruling and putting pressure on the government.

Moreover, the Endorois are now working closely with the Colombian human rights group Dejusticia, which has dealt with similar cases thousands of miles away. Bringing knowledge of past cases in South America to bear, this collaboration has helped the Endorois document their immaterial losses. The resultant report is a critical component in their negotiation with the government.

"Despite the setback, the Endorois case has had a significant impact on accentuating the voice of not just the Endorois but other marginalised communities," says George Kegoro, the Executive Director of KHRC. "The State has finally moved from denying liability or acknowledgement of the injustice to considering viable pathways to implementation."

Since the 1970s, the Endorois have sought justice through protest, political dialogue, national and international courts. Now, four decades later, they are hoping that the support of international partners and solidarity of other groups in the Global South will finally ensure it is served.

HD 	Geographic Genteelisms - How We Use Geography to Hide Our Prejudice [opinion]

Jun 26, 2017 (Daily Trust/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The place of euphemism or genteelism, that is, intentionally indirect expressions that help us avoid causing offense or saying uncomfortable facts, is well-established in language use. But scholars of language have ignored a more subtle sort of genteelism, which is the use of geographic labels to give cover to our prejudices, to help us make willfully opaque references to ethnicity and race. I call this geographic or cartographicgenteelisms.

In this week's column I call attention to both international and Nigerian geographic genteelisms.

TD 
	

1."West": Although the term "West" is a cartographic referent and is one of the four cardinal directions in English, it really isn't a strictly geographic referent when it's used in international relations. It's simply a word that helps people to avoid saying white,(culturally) Christian or post-Christian, industrialized or post-industrialized societies.

A society that is advanced, industrialized or post-industrialized, but isn't racially "white" or culturally Christian or post-Christian is never referred to as being part of the "West." Japan, for instance, isn't in the West.Nor is South Korea. Turkey is white, developed, geographically in Europe but isn't in the "West" because it's Muslim. The United States and Canada are in the North American continent, and they are in the "West," but Mexico, another North American country, isn't in the "West." Apartheid South Africa, meanwhile, was regarded as being in the "West" (see "sub-Saharan Africa" below).

I think President Bill Clinton came close to admitting the terminological inexactitude of the notion of "the West" when he said, in a November 15,1999 speech to the Turkish Grand National Assembly,"... a community we loosely refer to as 'the West' is an idea, it has no fixed frontiers. It stretches as far as the frontiers of freedom can go."

Clinton was right that the "West" isn't a faithfulgeographic referent, but he was wrong that it is delimited by "freedom," which is an empty signifier, as semioticians (i.e., people who study the function and meaning of signs and symbols) call words that denote things or concepts that have no fixed, stable meaning or that "may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean," to quote Jeffrey Mehlman who wrote a seminal treatise on empty signifiers in 1972.

2. "Sub-Saharan Africa": "Sub-Sahara" literally means "below the Sahara," "sub" being a Latin prefix that means "below," "under,"lower," etc. But "sub" also means "inferior," as in "substandard," "subaltern,"subpar," etc.-a reason some Africanists resent the term "sub-Saharan Africa." They say it slylyconnotes that black people are sub-human.

"Sub-Saharan Africa" is merely a geographic gentilism for "Black Africa," that is, the part of Africa demographicallydominated by and under the majority rule of black people. It's a less racist-sounding way to distinguish "white" North Africa from the rest of Africa.Interestingly, South Africa wasn't considered a part of "sub-Saharan Africa" until white minority ruleended in the early 1990s.

Out of Africa's UN-recognized 54 countries, 46 are designated as "sub-Saharan" African countries by the UN Development Program, although four of the "sub-Saharan" countries-Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Chad- are actually not below the Sahara. But they are "black."

A Wake Forest University scholar by the name of TatendaMashanda didn't mince words about the racist underpinnings of the term: "[It] is a way of saying 'Black Africa' and talking about black Africans without sounding overtly racist,"he wrote.

3. "Inner city": In the United States and Britain (particularly in London),black neighborhoods in big cities are called inner cities. The expression insulates white people from the guilt of saying "poor black neighborhoods."

4. "Hood": The short form of "neighborhood," it's aeuphemism in American English to denote "inner city," that is, a place where poor black people live.

5. "Ghetto": This technically means a restricted part of a city where socially disaffiliated people live. It initially referred to the secluded settlements of Jewish people in Europe. Now it's a synonym for "inner city," and "hood."

6. "Urban":Although this term literally means concerned with or about a city, "urban" now means, at least in American English, "black" or "African American." People who want to avoid saying"black" or "inner city" or, worse, "ghetto" now say "urban." "Urban culture" now simply means black culture. "Urban violence" now means black-on-black violence. "Urban music" is now a synonym for hip-hop music.This is because most African Americans now live in urban areas.

7. "Rural": This now routinely used for poor, working-class white Americans. So the expression "rural folks" has now become a convenient shorthand for poor white people. This is an interesting reversal. Generations ago, black people were associated with rural America. They were sharecroppers in rural areas. After slavery ended, they moved to urban areas in droves and changed the demographics and culture of American cities forever. This instigated what has been called "white flight," that is, it led white people to flee urban areas. Poor whites went to rural areas and financially secure ones went to the outskirts of the city. See next point.

8. "Suburban": A suburb is a place affluent white (and a few black, Asian and Hispanic) people live. The word "suburb" and its inflection, "suburban," are now linguistic markers of wealth and prosperity. To say someone lives in a suburb is a linguistic cue to say they are wealthy or at least middle class. I know this sounds counter-intuitive to Nigerian English speakers who know suburban dwellers to be mostly poor people who can't afford to live in the city center.

9. "Global South"/Global North":In international relations,"Global South" refers to developing countries while "Global North" denotes wealthy nations, but these are actually geographically meaningless expressions because it's impossible to impose a cartographic order on the distribution of wealth and poverty. That's why although the United States, the world's most prosperous nation, is considered a part of the "Global North," it's geographically close to poor South American countries that are in the "Global South"-in common with African and Middle Eastern countries.

Synonyms for "Global North" and "Global South" are "First World" and "Third World."These terms started out as ideological constructs during the Cold War between the USA and the USSR. "The First World" consisted of the capitalist bloc led by the US, and the "Second World" was the communist bloc led by the USSR. The "Third World," also called the Non-Aligned Nations, identified neither with the USA nor with the USSR.

Over the years, however, these terms acquired approbatory and pejorative connotations. The "First World" has come to mean "white," industrialized and post-industrialized "Western" societies, and the "Third World" has come to mean societies that are not the "West." Second World is now barely used, but when it is, it's used to refer to societies that are thought to be more economically prosperous than the "Third World" but nonetheless behind the "First World" in developmental terms. Because of the imprecision of the terms, the Associated Press Stylebook discourages the use of "Third World." It recommends "developing countries" instead.

10. "Middle East": This simply means Arabs or Arab-speaking people. Although Israel is technically in the Middle East, Israelis aren't often thought of, or even referred to, as Middle Easterners in popular discourse. That's why Donald Trump told Israeli leaders (in Israel!) on May 22, 2017 that he "Just got back from the Middle East," referring to his trip to Saudi Arabia.

But Berbers who are in North Africa are easily identified as Middle Easterners. Even Egypt, which is geographically in Africa, is considered "Middle East" because it's predominantly Arab and Muslim. There is even a "Greater Middle East," which includes countries like Somalia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and predominantly Muslim Central Asian countries like Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In other words, "the Middle East" is almost becoming synonymous with "the Muslim world."

11. "Core Northerners": In Nigerian English, this term basically means culturally/ethnically Hausa or Hausa-speaking Muslims. An ethnically Hausa Christian isn't a "core northerner." Nor is a non-Hausa Muslim northerner. Initially a neologism of the Lagos press, it has been embraced by Hausa Muslim northerners since at least the year 2000 in response to President Obasanjo's apparent preferential treatment of non-Hausa, non-Muslim Northerners in political appointments between 1999 and 2007.

Hausa Muslim Northern elites, who had dismissedthe notion of a "core North" as a Southern media rhetorical strategy to "divide" the North, appear to have now accepted the marginality of other Northerners when it comes to thetokenistic benefits of "northernerness."

12. "Middle Belters":On the surface, the term appears to refer to Nigerians who are caught in the mid region of the country. But that's deceptively misleading. It actually means Northern Christians who are not ethnically Hausa. It excludes non-Hausa northern Muslims and Hausa Muslims in Nigeria's central states. It also excludes Hausa Christians, although they are more welcome to this identity marker than Hausa Muslims. That's why a non-Hausa Christian from southern Borno, or from southernKebbi, which is as far north as you can get, is considered a "Middle Belter," but a Hausa Muslim from the central state of Niger isn't.

Middle Belt intellectuals try to explain away this contradiction by drawing a distinction between the "geographical Middle Belt" and the "cultural Middle Belt."But this is merely a tediously roundabout way to say a Middle Belter is a non-Muslim, non-Hausa northerner.

In other words, just like "core north" is a geographic genteelism for "Hausa Muslim North," "Middle Belt" is a geographic genteelism for a Christian ethnic minority from what colonial cartographers designated as the "north" since the early 1900s.

13: "South-southerners": This basically means southerners who are neither Igbo nor Yoruba. In other words, it means southern ethnic minorities.

HD 	Refugee Protection an Obligation Under International Law [opinion]

United Nations, Jun 22, 2017 (Inter Press Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- It is impossible to be ten years as High Commissioner for Refugees, doing my best to try to help the most vulnerable of the vulnerable, without changing your life. And, indeed, not only witnessing the suffering of people but also learning [about] the extraordinary courage, resilience and capacity to permanently generate hope of refugees is something that has changed my perspective of the world and, to a large extent, changed my life.

And this was the reason why I became candidate for Secretary-General of the United Nations.

TD 
	

Now we are witnessing the largest number of refugees ever. But it is important to say that refugee protection is not a matter of solidarity or generosity, refugee protection is an obligation under international law - the '51 Convention and many regional instruments of binding nature. And, as a matter of fact, during the ten years in which I was High Commissioner for Refugees, I have to say that, by large, international law was respected.

Borders were, in general, open, very few situations where refugees were rejected or sent back to their countries of origin, where they might face persecution - what is technically called refoulement. The number of resettlement opportunities offered by developed countries for refugees living in camps and other dramatic situations in the developing world has doubled during those ten years and there was, in general, a strong acceptance by Member States that refugee protection was something that was needed and had to be granted.

The situation has considerably changed now. It's true that we are still witnessing a very large number of countries doing an enormous effort to provide protection to refugees in very dramatic circumstances. I'll be flying tonight to Uganda. Uganda has been receiving, very generously, refugees from the neighbouring countries - it has now more than 1.3 million refugees, 950,000 from South Sudan alone - and providing them not only with protection, but even with plots of land and the capacity to live not in camps, but in the society, in a way that is much more humane but, of course,, that requires a much stronger solidarity from the country itself.

We are still witnessing many remarkable examples of solidarity in today's world. But at the same time, we are seeing more and more borders being closed, we are seeing more and more refugees being rejected and, namely in countries of the developed world, we are seeing the opportunities for resettlement in richer countries of refugees coming from the global South being decreased in number at the present moment.

And this is particularly worrying, especially when associated to forms of political populism, xenophobia, racism, in which refugees become a target, many times being accused of being part of the terror threat when refugees are not terrorists - they are the first victims of terror, they are fleeing terror; that is why they are refugees. And this is the reason why I believe it is important to make today five very strong appeals to the international community. Five very strong appeals that I believe are absolutely necessary for the right of refugees to be again fully respected.

First: I call Member States that are not doing it, to re-establish the integrity of the international protection for refugees regime, which means to have the right, obviously, to manage their borders in a responsible way, but managing them also in a protection-sensitive way, and not refusing entry to those seeking asylum and deserving protection, which means asking countries not to send back people to where they might face persecution, which means asking countries to increase their resettlement quotas and to grant protection to a larger number of refugees that are living in very dramatic circumstances in crowded camps or in the slums of cities in abject poverty.

Second: recognizing that there is no humanitarian solution for the refugee plight, the solution is political and it is related to the solution of the conflict that generate refugees in larger numbers; to ask all parties to different conflicts in the world and all countries that have an influence on the parties to each conflict to come together and understand that all those conflicts are now conflicts that are causing tremendous suffering in which nobody is winning, everybody is losing, that are becoming a threat not only to the refugees themselves but a threat to the whole world, as those conflicts are becoming also more and more interlinked to problems of global terrorism.

Third: humanitarian support for refugees is still largely underfunded. I believe that, grosso modo, appeals made are funded at about 50%. That means that the majority of the refugees live below the poverty line -- that many cannot bring their children to school, that many cannot guarantee adequate nutrition to their children, that many have not adequate health support, that most of them have no jobs and no hopes or perspective to have a dignified life. It is absolutely crucial that humanitarian appeals are fully funded and that international solidarity is expressed in relation to refugees, not forgetting that 80% of the world's refugees live in the developing world.

Fourth: I appeal to countries in the developed world to be able to express a much stronger solidarity to countries of first asylum in the global South; those that host, as I mentioned, 80% of the world's refugees, and sometimes with a dramatic impact on their economy, on their society, not to mention the impact on their security with the conflict next door.

If one looks at countries like Lebanon, where one third of the population is refugees, if one looks at countries like Uganda or Kenya or Ethiopia - they have now more than one million refugees- in societies that are poor, that lack resources, that have huge development gaps and huge development problems; it is absolutely crucial not only to support refugees but to support those communities. And that requires effective development cooperation with these countries.

I must praise the World Bank that was able to create new financial instruments, namely for middle-income countries that are hosting a large number of refugees, in the cases of Lebanon and Jordan innovating financially, to allow these countries to have a little bit more support than the one that they were receiving from the international community.

But the truth is that at the same time, countries are asking those in the developing world that host the largest number of refugees to keep them but are not providing the necessary support for that to be possible. Stronger solidarity with refugee-hosting countries in the global South is absolutely a must.

And finally: I ask countries in the developed world to increase their resettlement quotas at least to the levels that we had two or three years ago, to be able to offer an effective responsibility-sharing with those that are hosting millions of refugees in the deep South.

Just to give you an idea about the differences between the global North and the global South, I'm going to Uganda, as I mentioned. Uganda, last year, received three times more refugees from South Sudan than those crossing the central Mediterranean, and you all know the enormous impact in public opinion and in political debates that the movement through the central Mediterranean caused last year. Well, Uganda received three times more, and Uganda is a tiny country with a relatively small economy and with an enormous generosity in the hearts of the people and the decisions of the Government.

I'd also like to remind you that beyond those that are able to cross the border to seek protection outside their country, we have an even larger number, probably about double, of people that are displaced within the borders of their own country, internally displaced people. And those are under the authority either of their Governments or of different non-State actors that occupy parts of the territory.

And they have been systematically, in many parts of the world, victims of dramatic violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. And so I also would like to make a very strong appeal to all actors in all the conflicts to respect international humanitarian law and to respect human rights law and for the international community to be able to implement those methods of accountability to make sure that those that are responsible for the worst atrocities to be effectively accountable and to be punished for what they are doing, because that's probably the only way to stop the kind of tragic impact we are having in the life and dignity of now more than 65 million people around the world.

I also think it's important to underline that the difficulties faced by refugees are also linked to the fact that the migration debate has become quite irrational in today's world. We are talking about two different situations: refugees crossing borders, fleeing conflict or prosecution, [and] economic migrants who aspire legitimately to have a better life and move from one country to another, aiming at a better future for them and their children.

They do not have the same rights as refugees, countries are not forced to grant them protection, but they also have human rights that also need to be respected and their dignity needs to be respected. Now, the truth is that the debate about the migration became largely an irrational debate. Migration has been present in the world since [forever], and as a matter of fact, if one looks at demographic and economic projections of different parts of the world, migration is a necessary element of establishing different forms of equilibrium in the global society and the global economy.

In my country, my mother is assisted by some people, she is 93 years old, and those that are assisting her - they are not Portuguese. They are from different countries, they are migrants in my country, and Portugal is a relatively poor country in the context of the European Union. And so migration is necessary. If something is necessary, it's better to control it and to do it regularly than to let smugglers and traffickers be in charge of these movements.

And so my strong appeal in relation to migration is that a rational debate become possible about migration, that of course countries have the right to apply their own migration policies, but that they do that in full respect of human rights, that at the same time, development cooperation policies are able to address the problems of human mobility, to create opportunities in countries of origin for migration to be out of choice, not out of necessity, and much stronger cooperation of States among themselves to crack down on smugglers and traffickers, but also a much big offer of opportunities of legal, regular migration.

I think if migration can be discussed in a rational way, that will create a much better environment in our societies that are all multiethnic, multicultural, multireligious, and at the same time that will also help refugees benefit more easily from the protection rights they are entitled to receive.

We will have two very important debates in the General Assembly next year for two compacts: on migration and refugees. And my appeal to all Member States is to engage positively in those debates and to allow for the international community to be able to define, both in [terms of] refugees and in migration, adequate policies that are assumed by the whole of the international community, respecting human rights, taking into account the legitimate interests of States, but also the opportunities that are generated by human mobility in our world.

Jun 06, 2017 (AfricaFocus/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- "3.3 million more abortions. 15,000 more mothers dying. 8 million more unplanned pregnancies. ...

The headline (my wording) may seem alarmist, but detailed examination of the health agendas being advanced by the Trump administration and right-wing Republicans leaves little doubt of the consequences should they be fully implemented. There will indeed likely be millions of deaths resulting both from the House domestic healthcare plan, which would remove 23 million from health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and from the provisions for global health in administration's new budget. That would eliminate funding for family planning, threaten funding for HIV/AIDS and famine relief, and impose massive cuts on institutions such as the Center for Disease Control which are vital to protection against epidemics.

One may withhold judgment on the motivations of the policymakers, including the relative weight of ideology, indifference, lack of human empathy, and greed. And most observers say the full package is unlikely to survive Congressional scrutiny, even among many Republicans. But much of the damage, such as the Global Gag Rule cited above, comes from executive decisions already being implemented, such as the new version of the Global Gag Rule. The proponents of this agenda, it is clear by their explicit statements, reject the universal right to health, and give little or no value to the lives of those who are not wealthy and white.

This AfricaFocus Bulletin continues two summary articles on the Global Gag Rule and the Trump budget, as well as a reflection on the pressures facing progressive health advocates stretched by the attacks on both domestic and global health.

The Trump global gag rule: an attack on US family planning and global health aid

By Ann M. Starrs, Guttmacher Institute

The Lancet, February 4, 2017

http://www.thelancet.com - Direct URL: http://tinyurl.com/ya8ngh4h

On Jan 23, 2017, on his fourth day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing the global gag rule, an anti-abortion policy that under other conservative presidential administrations has caused serious disruptions to US overseas family planning efforts. Alarmingly, Trump's order goes even further than in the past, with potentially devastating effect.

Credit for graphic: Human Rights Watch

The global gag rule, also known as the Mexico City policy, was devised in 1984 by the administration of Ronald Reagan to impose a draconian set of anti-abortion rules on US overseas family planning programmes. This policy banned US family planning funds from going to foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that provide abortion services, counselling, or referrals, or advocate for liberalisation of their country's abortion laws--even if they use non-US government funds for these activities. In 1984, and every time the global gag rule has been imposed since then, foreign governments were exempt for diplomatic reasons, as were US-based NGOs on constitutional grounds.

To be clear, legislation was already in place in 1984, and is still in place now, that bans the use of US funds under the Foreign Assistance Act from paying "for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning". But for anti-abortion activists this Helms Amendment, passed in 1973, did not go far enough; they wanted to limit any activity that could possibly enable or promote abortion. Hence, the global gag rule.

Under Trump's order, the gag rule now applies not only to US bilateral family planning assistance (US$575 million for fiscal year 2016), but also to all "global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies"--encompassing an estimated $9.5 billion in foreign aid. Foreign NGOs that receive US funding to work on a broad range of health programmes in about 60 low-income and middle-income countries--including on HIV/AIDS, the Zika virus, malaria, tuberculosis, nutrition, and maternal and child health, among others--will potentially be subject to the same ideological restrictions that have hampered family planning aid at points in the past. Thus, President Trump's version of the global gag rule represents a wider attack on global health aid writ large.

Adding to the widespread concern among US government agencies, global health NGOs, and advocates is the Trump administration's failure to provide any guidance on the interpretation or application of the new policy.

Those details may emerge in the coming weeks and months. But we already know that, when last in effect, the gag rule crippled family planning programmes. Many foreign NGOs, as a matter of principle and out of dedication to the patients they serve, refused to let the US Government muzzle their abortion advocacy efforts or dictate what services or counselling they provided using their non-US funds. These health providers were forced to reduce staff and services, or even shut clinics. As a result, many thousands of women no longer had access to family planning and reproductive health services from these clinics--sometimes the only provider of such services in the local community. Various actors, including the governments of Canada and the Netherlands, are mobilising to compensate for at least some of the damage that will be done by the gag rule. But the US is the largest funder of global health programmes worldwide, and the disruption this aid effort will suffer is massive.

Moreover, there is no evidence that the global gag rule has ever resulted in its stated aim of reducing abortion. The first study to measure the effect of the gag rule showed that this policy could actually have resulted in an increase in abortions. Another study assessed the gag rule in Ghana and found that because of declines in the availability of contraceptive services, both fertility and abortion rates were higher during the gag rule years than during non-gag rule years in rural and poor populations. This is consistent with anecdotal data that the gag rule's main effect has been to reduce women's access to quality contraceptive services, thereby increasing the probability of unintended pregnancy and making recourse to abortion more likely.

But the harmful effects of Trump's order are likely be even greater. NGOs in lowincome settings often provide integrated health services; for instance, they offer patients contraceptive care, HIV prevention or treatment, maternal health screenings, immunisations, and information on safe abortion care all under one roof. By expanding the gag rule to the full scope of US global health aid, hundreds more national and local NGOs will be forced to choose between drastic funding cuts (if they decline to sign the gag rule) or denying their patients the information and services that are their right (if they sign, and can no longer provide or discuss abortion). Millions of women living in low-resource settings may now be unable to obtain the care they need, when they need it.

The unprecedented scope of the Trump global gag rule validates the fears of many observers: reproductive health and rights worldwide will face a sustained attack in the next 4 years of the Trump Administration. This assault will almost certainly include defunding the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), as well as potentially drastic cuts to US overseas family planning aid. It will be mirrored domestically by efforts to restrict abortion access--for instance, by banning all private and public insurance coverage of abortion or prohibiting the most commonly used method for second-trimester procedures--and to shred the nation's family planning safety net, including by defunding Planned Parenthood.

It is becoming clearer with each Trump executive order that not only reproductive health but also global health programmes and overall foreign assistance supported by the US Government are in grave jeopardy, as indicated by President Trump's repeated promises to "put America first". The social conservatives driving this agenda--who now control the US Presidency and both Houses of Congress--are showing complete disregard for the millions of women, men, and children who will suffer the consequences, intended or not, of these regressive policies.

Trump's budget eliminates US funding for global family planning and famine relief

by Sarah Wildman

Vox, May 24, 2017

http://www.vox.com - Direct URL: http://tinyurl.com/lrtqf72

3.3 million more abortions. 15,000 more mothers dying. 8 million more unplanned pregnancies. Up to 26 million fewer women and couples acquiring contraception and family planning advice.

Those grim numbers from the Guttmacher Institute show the potential real-world impact of the Trump administration's unprecedented proposed cuts to global family planning efforts; the budget the White House released Tuesday would basically eliminate those programs.

It also calls for gutting a key US famine relief program, slashing half the budget for the USAID's internal disaster relief organization, and cutting $222 million from funds allocated to fight HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The justification listed in the budget is a simple hope for others to fill the shortfall:

The United States has been the largest donor by far to global HIV/AIDS efforts, providing over half of global donor funding in recent years to combat this epidemic. The Budget reduces funding for several global health programs, including HIV/AIDS, with the expectation that other donors can and should increase their commitments to these causes.

If Congress were to agree to those cuts (and that's a big if), advocates say the global impact of America's abrupt departure from world health and disaster relief would be immediate -- and devastating.

"The family planning elimination is the headline here," said Rachel Silverman, a senior policy analyst on global health at the Center for Global Development. "It will have the most impact on people's lives."

But Trump's proposed cuts to food aid and disaster relief would also deal a major blow to some of the world's neediest and most desperate. Marilyn Shapley, a top official at the aid group Mercy Corps, said some 70 million people need emergency food assistance, while 20 million more are in famine-like conditions.

"This is going to take away food assistance from 33 million people in a year when famine risk is higher than in decades," she said in an interview. "Before today I wouldn't have thought it possible."

Funding family planning actually makes economic, not just moral, sense

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has taken aim at global family planning and women's health.

In January, Trump reinstated the "Mexico City Policy," also known as the global gag rule, which literally bars family planning providers from mentioning abortion in their work. (The United States has long banned funds for abortion services.)

The policy is one that changes depending on the party of the president in power. Obama immediately rescinded the policy when he moved into the White House; Trump, like other Republican presidents before him, immediately reinstated it when he came into office. As I wrote in January, the policy has traditionally limited the ability of global family planning providers to give women and families comprehensive care if in any aspect of their work they recommend, discuss, or even mention abortions to clients, let alone provide abortion services.

But Trump went further than his predecessors. Previous Republican administrations limited the policy to family planning providers; the Trump administration extended the gag rule to all global health providers. That meant health care providers working on everything from maternal and child health to malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and vaccinations were now at risk of losing all US funding if they discussed abortion in their work.

The NGO PAI estimated that the extended gag rule would affect about 15 times more US funding than the gag rule had in the past. In mid-May, when the new rule went into effect, Suzanne Ehlers, president and CEO of PAI, said Trump's move would do "unspeakable damage to integrated care efforts."

That's a problem. With integrated care, a woman can come to a single clinic for, say, vaccines for her children, then see a physician about her own contraceptive needs, and finally seek advice, or refill prescriptions. In other words, she can meet all her family's health care needs in one spot. For families traveling long distances, an all-in-one clinic makes far more sense than one clinic for maternal health and another for child care and still another for other medical services.

The Trump administration spent the first quarter of 2017 signaling plans to undermine that sort of integrated care by reinstating the gag rule and beginning to reduce US funding for maternal and infant health around the world.

In April, the administration announced it would strip the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA), which works on reproductive health, family planning, HIV/AIDS, and infant and maternal mortality in more than 150 countries, of all US funding. The putative reason was a specious one.

"This decision is based on the erroneous claim that UNFPA 'supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization' in China," a statement on the UNFPA website read. "UNFPA refutes this claim, as all of its work promotes the human rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination."

A State Department memo obtained by the Associated Press found no evidence that US money had supported forced abortion or sterilization in China.

The decision costs the UNFPA $32.5 million in funding from the 2017 budget; the United States was the fourth-largest donor to the organization.

The new budget would hit global health even harder.

Silverman noted that there's a "dissonance" between White House messages on women and families. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, has claimed to be championing the idea of women'e economic empowerment. That sort of program, Silverman says, would be completely undermined by stripping global family planning from the budget.

"There is a lot of evidence that family planning contributes to women's empowerment," says Silverman, ticking off a list of things that planning, delaying, and spacing pregnancies allow women to do -- like receiving an education, or even simply advancing at work. "When women have control over fertility, they have control over their lives."

Silverman points out that USAID directly funds 28 percent of contraceptives and distribution in the developing world.

"If you cross-reference that with the number of women using contraceptives in those countries -- a back-of-envelope calculation -- that suggests that 10 million women are directly relying on USAID for contraceptives," she said, adding that enormous numbers of women will "see a major disruption in their lives if this goes through and other donors don't step up in a major way."

But there aren't other donors looking to step in. Jonathan Rucks, who runs PAI's advocacy efforts, says there is no other donor government that can make up the shortfall, and even major private family foundations, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, simply cannot replace the US on family planning. In February, Bill Gates told the Guardian that Trump's proposed reinstatement of the global gag rule could "create a void that even a foundation like ours can't fill."

"If you are cutting maternal health funding, then you don't care about survival of women," Rucks says bluntly. "We are also going to be really frank and say this is not pro-life. This is undermining all your pro-life credentials."

Global Health in the Trump Era: Reflections on the Backlash

by Michelle Morse

Praxis, May 17, 2017

https://www.kzoo.edu/praxis/global-health-backlash/

Over the past thirty years, American medicine has witnessed an unprecedented expansion in global health engagement amongst its trainees and faculty, partially, if not largely, fueled by the health care injustices lived so dramatically by patients in resource-limited countries around the world during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Initially seen as disruptive, the interventions in the health sectors of Global South countries by American health professionals were eventually accepted as essential acts in the movement towards achieving global health equity. As America experiences the Trump era, endless questions have arisen amongst global health professionals about the implications of Trump's "America first" platform on global health. Will Trump's nationalist agenda eliminate funding for life-saving global health programs, cause progressive health professionals engaged in global health to make a reactionary turn towards the fire at home, and even force global health practitioners to more closely examine their own prejudices?

It is no secret that American physicians leading the guard in global health tend to be part of the political left. Global health tends to attract left leaning physicians because of the global health movement's belief that every human being has a right to receive high quality health care. Asserting that Global North countries have a responsibility to contribute towards strengthening health care systems in the Global South (a redistribution of resources, of sorts), global health offers the opportunity to practically address urgent health care access inequities in the Global South.

Considering these principles, global health professionals like myself are deeply frustrated by the Trump administration's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut global health spending at USAID and other similar programs. Though many of us are rightfully drawn towards activism in the USA to resist these moves by the new administration, I worry that the health and health systems of the Global South will suffer if the majority of global health professionals shift to focus domestically without continuing their engagement in global health.

While some would say that the current neoliberal structure of development aid is already ineffective, especially since so many of the aid resources are actually directed back to the country where the aid comes from, what would it mean if global health funding was eliminated, and American global health professionals suddenly focused exclusively on domestic health?

Would it allow Global South countries to assume stronger leadership, decision-making, and self-directed problem solving? Or would it mean that Global South communities would be even more deprived of much needed resources and health care access? Post-earthquake Haiti, where I have worked for seven years and lived for two of those years, is one compelling example of both the peril and the potential of aid. Of the $8 billion US funds provided in aid after the earthquake, less than 1% went to the Haitian government who was ultimately responsible for rebuilding the country.

Yet, as appalling as this statistic is, it does not adequately describe the individual impact of short- and long-term global health engagement by American health professionals in response to the earthquake. Take EqualHealth for example, the organization I co-founded. EqualHealth is a nongovernmental organization focused on bringing light to the socially determined root causes of illness and creating equity in opportunity for Haitian health professionals whose talent and vision are often overshadowed by negative media narratives about Haiti, weaknesses in the Haitian public health system, and limited opportunities for professional development.

All things considered, the reality is that countries like Haiti rely on the shrinking aid from global health programs such as PEPFAR to keep their health systems running despite fluctuations in attention from the donor world. Where Global South countries would find themselves without USAID, or partnership with Global North health professionals, or other mechanisms to ensure more adequate resources for pressing health concerns is as predictable as where Americans, who rely on the Affordable Care Act for health insurance, will find themselves when it is repealed and replaced with a market-based solution.

What I have witnessed in my academic institution is an exciting and growing interest amongst trainees in building infrastructure to resist the new administration's domestic health care and civil rights policies.

To mount a harmonized response, they are looking into establishing indivisible chapters and partnerships with community based organizations, learning and using direct action methods such as bird-dogging, non-violent protest, and holding teach-ins on community organizing. These are often the very same trainees that are also interested in global health. Though many of them are considering careers in global health, opportunities for long-term global health engagement with clear career paths and mentorship are often limited, and may now become even more limited given the policies of the new American administration.

On the other hand, recent significant increases in donations to organizations like Planned Parenthood could mean new opportunities for engagement for these trainees, shaping careers focused on domestic health care. This is occurring at a time when structural competency and social medicine are emerging as key areas of focus in medical school and residency curricula, and trainees are being encouraged to engage in activism as a professional obligation rather than aspiration. Health professionals often hesitated to engage in activism as it was not an explicit part of their training, and opportunities to act were difficult to identify, but these barriers seem to be evaporating under the new administration.

In response to mounting evidence documenting how health care provider prejudice impacts health, American medical schools are also developing competencies in which trainees and faculty alike are encouraged to reflect on their personal biases. These competencies are even more relevant now as the policies of this new administration threaten the rights and livelihoods of people of color, women, Muslims, and immigrants.

Efforts to establish global health competencies, while laudable, have often been silent on addressing the issues of racism, sexism, and other forms of prejudice amongst global health professionals. The social and cultural power and privilege clash that occurs when predominantly white global health professionals from Global North countries descend on countries in the Global South to work hand in hand with local health professionals who are predominantly people of color is a tinderbox for racism and prejudice in all its forms.

The global health movement can learn from the new light being shed on the old problem of racism, as a result of the racist policies and messages coming from the Trump administration in its first 100 days. The global health movement needs to take the necessary steps to explicitly address racism and other forms of prejudice amongst its members, and ask honest questions about why more Americans of color are not currently a part of it. The far too common assumption that being left leaning, progressive, or engaged in global health is incompatible with being racist is simply incorrect.

As communities and countries in the Global South continue to suffer the consequences of neoliberalism-induced fragile health systems, some global health professionals may decide to deepen their engagement outside the USA, attempting to flee the nationalist, racist, and sexist trends of the new administration by moving and working abroad. Other global health professionals may decide to engage domestically to resist the actions of the new administration, seeing the battle for health care access and civil rights at home as more urgent and compelling. Ideally, all progressive global health professionals, whether choosing a domestic or globally focused path, will begin to address their own prejudices in new action-oriented ways.

There is a delicate but important balance between advocating for ongoing American engagement in addressing global health inequities, while also addressing domestic health care threats. One shouldn't be prioritized over the other or at the expense of the other, as they represent two parts of the same global battle for health as a human right that culminated in the Alma Ata Declaration, lost its way, and is reemerging. Perhaps the real test will lie in America's response under the Trump administration to the next Ebola, the next Zika, or the next HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Doha, May 03, 2017 (Inter Press Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Taha avoids giving his last name to journalists, but not out fear of the Sudanese government, whose harassment he fled in 2015.

"I don't want any of the people I worked with to know I'm here," he tells Al Jazeera, writing by instant messaging from a temporary residence for refugees in the French city of Calais.

TD 
	

"I want to avoid causing any embarrassment or awkwardness," he adds.

The colleagues Taha refers to are journalists who covered the ongoing war in Sudan's western province of Darfur.

The father-of-two worked as a stringer, fixer, and translator there for a number of major broadcasters based in the UK and South Africa.

However, as the conflict dragged on, coverage dried up because of restrictions placed on foreign media by the Sudanese government and as editorial agendas shifted to other wars in the region.

Even in death, there is apparently a double standard in the newspaper world: one yardstick to measure the killing or abduction of, say, a reporter from the New York Times or the Washington Post and another yardstick to measure the kidnapping and murder, for example, of a journalist in Bangladesh, Nepal or Sri Lanka.

Taha says his track record as a journalist was enough to attract unwanted attention from the Sudanese authorities, but it was his next move that sealed his fate.

"I helped to set up a school for IDP (internally displaced) children in Khartoum, which was very successful and had about 800 students."

Most of the pupils at the school were from the two conflict-stricken regions of Darfur and South Kordofan.

The Sudanese government, in an apparent bid to punish him for his journalistic work, eventually accused Taha of receiving money from foreign organisations.

After a cycle of harassment, arrests and releases, he decided to flee.

His first port of call was the Egyptian port city of Alexandria, from where he set sail with scores of others on a poorly maintained vessel headed for Europe.

The overcrowded boat capsized in the Mediterranean, but Taha was among the survivors after Greek rescuers plucked him from the waters.

After time in a Greek holding facility, Taha made his way across Europe eventually reaching northern France, from where he hoped to cross the English Channel and reach the UK, where his brother lived.

With one final hurdle left to overcome, however, Taha became ill with a benign tumour growing on his spine.

In the year since the diagnosis, his attempts to enter Britain have been put on hold while he undergoes treatment.

Taha hopes to join his brother who lives in the English city of Liverpool, but is resigned to the idea his appeals to the British Home Office for asylum will not succeed.

His story is just one of many that highlights the struggle of journalists from the Global South when western media outlets pack up and go.

Double standards

The work of stringers, in particular, is crucial in ensuring good coverage in difficult reporting environments, but when the story dies down, they are often left to deal alone with hostile governments or non-state actors.

Taha's experiences are far from unique or limited to Sudan, which is ranked 140 of 180 countries on Reporters Without Borders' 2016 World Press Freedom Index.

According to UNESCO, at least 929 journalists were killed between 2006 and 2016.

Of those killed, 94 percent, or at least 869 were local reporters. Sixty were foreign correspondents.

Most were killed in the Middle East and North Africa and Asia and the Pacific.

UNESCO recorded at least 12 killings of local journalists in Afghanistan in 2016, making it the deadliest country for reporters last year.

"Local Afghan journalists have experienced large numbers of threats against them," Rachael Jolley of the Index on Censorship told Al Jazeera.

"Many Afghan journalists have stopped reporting and some have fled the country after threats against their lives."

Jolley noted a surge in threats towards journalists in that country from around 2014, further blaming armed groups and gangs for harassing those in the media.

In other countries, journalists face the risk of kidnap and murder, while those who work with international media outlets face particular suspicion as potential spies, Jolley said.

"In Yemen, for instance, local journalists are threatened, kidnapped and released. The same tactics have been used in Syria to close down reporting.

"In some cases, the international media and those that work with it are also in massive danger, they are seen as traitors or spies."

But despite the threats they face, journalists in the Global South receive little attention from their fellow colleagues around the world when targeted.

Lack of coverage

In March alone this year, in Mexico, for instance, at least three journalists have been killed - Miroslava Breach who chronicled murder, columnist Ricardo Monlui and Cecilio Pineda Birto.

Their stories were covered by local and regional media, but largely ignored by international newspapers, websites and television channels. Their names did not trend worldwide as hashtags on social media.

In 2016, of the 100 journalists who were killed, 93 were citizens from the Global South, according to UNESCO.

Farhana Haque Rahman, the director general of the Inter Press Service, said that the level of coverage and outcry each case received depends on where journalists are from and whether or not they are affiliated with western outlets.

"Even in death, there is apparently a double standard in the newspaper world: one yardstick to measure the killing or abduction of, say, a reporter from the New York Times or the Washington Post and another yardstick to measure the kidnapping and murder, for example, of a journalist in Bangladesh, Nepal or Sri Lanka," she told Al Jazeera.

Rahman put the double standard down to a "mindset" in Western newsrooms that reflected the interests of their audience, but added journalists have a responsibility to change that.

"Change in perspective has to come from the inside, not from the outside."

But according to City University Department of Journalism academic Abdullahi Tasiu Abubakar, differing responses were more closely related to whether journalists were members of staff or contractors for media outlets.

"The double standard involves full-time (staff) correspondents and freelancers... that's a more clear demarcation in terms of how it's treated," he said, adding "mainstream media tend to treat their full-time reporters with more care and concern than freelancers".

Abubakar explained that as the main market for stringers, fixers, and freelancers was in the Global South, it meant they were most affected by the differing standards of treatment.

Mainstream media tend to treat their full-time reporters with more care and concern than freelancers.

Abdullahi Tasiu Abubakar, academic at City University Department of Journalism

He said there was also a disparity in information flow from the Global South and Global North that translated into uneven levels of coverage for events depending on where they were happening.

This is, he said, was not exclusive to journalists but a wider reflection of which societies in the West prioritised.

Abubakar, himself a former reporter in Nigeria and producer for the BBC World Service, told Al Jazeera that media organisations should take on further responsibilities for their stringers, including the provision of adequate hostile environment training.

"Media organisations in the West have a massive responsibility to protect the journalist who work with them and in cases where their freelancers are being persecuted, they should put pressure on their governments to act against the offending government."

In a similar vein, the Index on Censorship's Jolley said that the risks journalists faced are not limited to threats from other people or government; she said inadequate training for local journalists also puts them in danger.

"[Index] has reported on freelance Iraqi journalists who had been reporting from the battlefield without any special training or equipment ... Safety and security training is vital in these situations.

"We've been told that mainstream media channels in the UK, at least, are now refusing to use freelancers from locations that they would consider too dangerous for a staffer."

For Taha in Calais, those decisions have come too late; such prospects make very little difference to his current situation.

His treatment has gone well and he now plans his days planning how he will reach the UK.

Despite his experience and reluctant acceptance things could have been different if he had a different ethnic background, Taha is grateful to be in Europe and harbours no ill will towards those he worked with.

Like many journalists, his interest in current affairs is difficult to shake off, and his days are spent discussing politics with his fellow refugees.

A recent round of deportation of Sudanese asylum seekers by the French authorities has rattled his optimism but he is careful not to dwell on it.

Bangkok and Sydney, Apr 27, 2017 (Inter Press Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- "The despised, the insulted, the hurt, the dispossessed--in short, the underdogs of the human race were meeting. ... Who had thought of organizing such a meeting? And what had these nations in common? Nothing, it seemed to me, but what their past relationship to the Western world had made them feel. This meeting of the rejected was in itself a kind of judgment upon the Western world!." --Richard Wright, The Color Curtain [University Press of Mississippi, 1956].

This is how Richard Wright, a novelist saw the gathering of leaders from 29 African and Asian nations at Bandung (Indonesia) on 18-25 April, 1955 of 29.

TD 
	

The leaders, prominent among them Jawaharlal Nehru (India), Kwame Nkrumah (Ghana), Gamal Abdel Nasser (Egypt), Chou En Lai (China), Ho Chi Minh (Viet Nam), and Adam Clayton Powell (Congressman from Harlem, USA), considered how they could help one another in achieving social and economic well-being for their large and impoverished populations. Their agenda addressed race, religion, colonialism, national sovereignty, and the promotion of world peace. In opening the conference, the President of Indonesia, Ahmed Sukarno asked,

"What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, ... , we can mobilize what I have called the Moral Violence of Nations in favour of peace.

The Bandung declaration

The final communique expressed, "general desire for economic co-operation among the participating countries on the basis of mutual interest and respect for national sovereignty"; "agreed to provide technical assistance to one another"; "recognized the vital need for stabilizing commodity trade"; recommended that: "Asian-African countries should diversify their export trade by processing their raw material, wherever economically feasible, before export"; promote "intraregional trade"; and provide "facilities for transit trade of land-locked countries".

The rise of the Third World and demand for a New International Economic Order

It was the beginning of what came to be known as the "non-aligned" movement and the "Third World" and within the United Nations, the Group of 77 plus China. With this confidence they called for the establishment of a New International Economic Order (NIEO) recognized at the 1974 General Assembly, based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and cooperation among all States, to correct inequalities and redress existing injustices; to eliminate the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries; and to ensure steadily accelerating economic and social development and peace and justice for present and future generations.

The NIEO declaration was, in effect, a call for shared and differentiated responsibility for equitable development.

Unfortunately, many aspects of the NIEO were never implemented. While the developing countries sought strategic integration with the global economy using trade and industry policies, they were advised to accept unfettered liberalization and privatization, which saw increased volatility and financial crises often disproportionately disadvantaging them. The aid conditionality of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank included straight-jacketed package of so-called "sound policies" that emphasized deregulation and a diminished role for the State. This drastically reduced state capability and developing countries' policy space to deal with crises, pursue their developmental aspirations and achieve structural transformation.

Through the experience of the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, the countries of the South have realized that they have to create their own policy space and craft out policies based on their own circumstances. Thus, they managed to grow steadily over the last two decades and were able to weather the 2008-2009 Great Recession remarkably well to anchor the global economic recovery.

The Global South is no longer a collection of "despised, the insulted, the hurt, the dispossessed--in short, the underdogs"; they are the drivers of global economy.

Global South's fault-lines

However, the issues facing developing countries are more complex now. They are faced with issues of inequalities and insecurities which affect social cohesion; climate change and uneven competition in global markets when key global negotiations on trade and climate change have broken down. They also face the potential danger of weakening of solidarity as the members of the Global South seek different interests.

It does not help when governance failure occurs in a number of the developing countries; when some are ripped apart by violent internal or regional conflicts, or manipulated because of rising extremisms of many sorts. Corruptions, lack of accountability and trembling of human rights are affront to the aspirations of independence and hinder the fulfilment of development and dignity for all. The governance failures and divided societies within have also weakened the developing South's ability to deal with issues of international governance in the globalizing world, and our common future even with "Rising Asia".

Reclaiming the Bandung spirit

Time has come for the rising Global South to collectively work for the unfinished business of a new international economic order that today has to take a more integrated and universal approach for people, planet and prosperity as highlighted in the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development goals (SDGs); to stabilize commodity prices; to improve export incomes; to ensure food security; to demand improved access to markets in developed countries; to put a stop to siphoning off capital through dubious transfer pricing arrangements of multinational corporations and international tax havens; to eliminate the instability of the international monetary system; to ensue full and effective participation in all decision-making in all global bodies, including the IMF and the World Bank, and in formulating an equitable and durable monetary system.

However, the developing South must lead by putting its own house in order; improve democratic governance, respect human rights especially women's human rights, and ensure wider freedom of its own citizen to re-establish legitimacy and trust through a new social contract that responds to the needs and hopes of all citizens, not just in form but in substance.

In the spirit of Bandung, they have to work together for the prosperity of their people and to protect humanity's common good, especially our planet. They should recall the message, "All of us ... are united by more important things than those which superficially divide us. ... And we are united by a common determination to preserve and stabilize peace in the world. . . ."

It is time to come together and advance together to address the risks and challenges that confront our world and harness the opportunities to build a more inclusive and sustainable future of shared prosperity. Only then can we sing:

A cry of defiance, and not of fear,

A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,

And a word that shall echo for evermore! (Longfellow; from President Sukarno's opening speech).

HD 	Fidel Castro's African Legacy - Friendship and Freedom [opinion]

Dec 01, 2016 (Al Jazeera/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Fidel Castro was the enduring face and voice of a Cuban internationalism forged at the height of the Cold War and still widely misunderstood by the global North.

In 1969, during a meeting with the Chilean foreign minister Gabriel Valdes, Henry Kissinger - who would later become the US secretary of state - declared: "Nothing important can come from the South. History has never been produced in the South. The axis of history starts in Moscow, goes to Bonn, crosses over to Washington, and then goes to Tokyo. What happens in the South is of no importance."

TD 
	

This so-called South - the global South - had already proved Kissinger wrong, though he was not astute enough to recognise it. As well as the emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement (of newly independent nations) at the Bandung Conference some 14 years earlier, post-revolution Cuba had been busy forging deep ties with countries that shared both its mistrust of US foreign policy and desire for true independence.

In the years that followed, Havana would provide not just symbolic but also military and economic support to peoples all over Asia, Africa and Latin America. This struggle for self-determination, which spread across the globe throughout the 20th century, is perhaps one of the most enduring legacies of Fidel Castro's Cuba. Nowhere has it had as deep an impact as in Africa, where Cuba helped consolidate the rule of socialist independent movements in several nations, and to bring about the end of apartheid in South Africa.

Cuba's influence on the global South began, symbolically, with the Cuban revolution itself, in 1959. "The Cuban revolution provided a sort of language for which places like Guinea-Bissau could dream of their future as independent countries," says Antonio Tomas, a biographer of African anti-colonial leader Amilcar Cabral.

It was an event which resonated with nations still fighting or only recently liberated from colonial occupations.

"I was a young student when I heard about it, and about Fidel, for the first time," says Adriano Pereira dos Santos Junior, who was part of the liberation struggle in Angola, won by the socialist MPLA. "The Cuban revolution and the defeat of Baptista was hugely influential for us in Angola."

State of turmoil

The following year, with Cuba already under sanctions from the US, Fidel Castro travelled to New York to address the United Nations, and found that he would be confined to Manhattan island by security measures.

After a spat with a hotel that demanded a $20,000 deposit from the Cubans, Castro and his delegation left and moved to the black-owned Hotel Theresa, in Harlem, where they were welcomed by el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz, Malcolm X.

Rosemari Mealy, an academic, writer and Black Panther Party member, who has written about the encounter, recalls: "Activists, journalists and regular Harlemites ... recalled witnessing thousands of pro-Cuba demonstrators in the streets in front of the hotel."

At the time, as Mealy points out, "all across the United States, including Harlem, blacks and other people of colour were waging relentless struggles against racism and police violence, the fight for decent housing, jobs and the end to segregation of public schools and transportation".

Castro's decision to stay in Harlem, to meet so publicly with Malcolm X and, subsequently, to receive a host of foreign leaders who were at odds with American foreign policy - including Nikita Khrushchev, Gamal Abdel Nasser, and Jawaharlal Nehru - antagonised the US administration but also served as a powerful example of how Cuba was positioning itself in relation to the rest of the world.

But the rest of the world was in a state of turmoil. The 1960 independence of the Republic of Congo was followed in January 1961 by the assassination of its new president, Patrice Lumumba, in which both the US and the United Nations played a role.

Then, just months later, in Cuba, the CIA orchestrated the invasion of the Bay of Pigs in an attempt to unseat Castro. It was not hard, at the time, for Cuba to convince the global South of the facts of American imperialism.

With the controversial, US-imposed sanctions as his calling card, Castro declared solidarity between Cuba and other oppressed, colonised, and newly independent nations.

According to Raquel Ribeiro, who writes about the relationship between Cuba and Angola, "there was a wide and significant network of influence in the so-called Third World, which stemmed clearly from the Tricontinental conference in Havana in 1966 as a movement of the 'global South', an alternative to imperial, neo-colonial forms of domination".

In its attempt to galvanise this movement, the Cuban government went beyond rhetoric and began to provide tangible support to those it counted among its allies. It was in this spirit that, in 1963, Cuba sent a delegation of 56 Cuban doctors to Algeria. Algeria was still recovering from a long war of liberation from France, and post-independence "white flight" had left the country desperately lacking in medical professionals.

This small, but symbolic, envoy from Havana was the beginning of a decades-long programme of Cuban "medical internationalism" which would leave a lasting legacy across Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, in particular. "The symbolic aspect was really the generosity," says Tomas. "And I think this is the narrative Fidel wanted to write. The history of the little island doing great things in Africa, far greater than the resources they had and so on ... . This internationalism was unprecedented."

But from its inception, medical internationalism was not only part of a humanitarian campaign (which also provided teachers, engineers and technicians); it was also fundamental to the military interventions that Cuba was launching abroad, particularly in Africa, where ongoing independence struggles were fast becoming a live battleground for the Cold War.

Arms and weapons to Africa

From 1963, Cuba began to provide arms and weapons training to allied movements in Algeria, Yemen, and to Amilcar Cabral's PAIGC movement for the liberation of Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, then still Portuguese colonies. But the support wasn't only practical. Rooted in a language of brotherhood and shared history, it was also emotional. "In a spirit of friendship," declared Amilcar Cabral, "... the bonds of history, blood and culture unite our peoples with the Cuban people."

Although outflanked by the Soviet Union in terms of the military and financial aid it provided, Cuba's internationalist support continued to be of importance to the emerging political leaders of the global South (including Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah; Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser; Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara; Mozambique's Eduardo Mondlane; and Angola's Agostinho Neto - not all of whom were then in power).

While these leaders were courted by Raul and Fidel Castro, it was Che Guevara who provided the idealism and passion for the armed struggle on the ground. Che intended to put the guerilla warfare theories he had developed - based on his own experiences in Cuba - into practice. In 1965, he embedded himself with 100 Afro-Cuban soldiers in the Republic of Congo, to train guerilla fighters in support of the Marxist Simba movement.

The mission was disastrous; his men were soon outnumbered by apartheid South African- and CIA-backed mercenaries, and he retreated, having learned a painful lesson about wading into unfamiliar conflicts. While subsequently hiding in Dar es Salaam, he offered his services to FRELIMO (the National Front for the Liberation of Mozambique), but was turned down. Not all African liberation movements wanted - or needed - help.

After Che's death in 1966, Cuban internationalism became more pragmatic. But over the following decade, the struggles for independence mutated into a series of bitter internal conflicts, heavily fuelled by foreign interests and Cold War politics.

At the request of the MPLA (the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola), Castro sent tens of thousands of Cubans to Angola under "Operation Carlotta" between 1975 and 1991, many of whom would die fighting against rival, US-backed and South-African apartheid forces. The Cuban forces' victory at the battle of Cuito Cuanavale in 1988 was a watershed moment in southern African history, heralding independence for Zimbabwe and Namibia - and the beginning of the end of South African apartheid. It was also the moment for Cuba to begin withdrawing militarily from Angola - although the civil war there would not end for another decade.

Cuba's decades-long involvement in Africa has left a disputed and complicated legacy; alongside the victory over apartheid sits their alleged involvement in the May 27 massacre in Angola; and the bloodshed from the 1977 Ethiopia-Somalia war, to mention just two examples.

The movements whose leadership Castro supported have not always fulfilled the hopes of the people they rule over, and some have morphed from socialism into something quite unrecognisable. But as Nelson Mandela - a lifelong friend of Castro - also remarked: "Cubans came to our region as doctors, teachers, soldiers, agricultural experts, but never as colonisers ... What other country has such a history of selfless behaviour as Cuba has shown for the people of Africa?"

Even today, thousands of Cuban doctors are working all over Africa and beyond - providing vital medical services including most recently during the Ebola crisis; supporting infrastructure, education and culture. "Internationalism is ingrained in Cuban society and it's a fundamental part of Cuban identity," says Ribeiro. "It will continue to live on, beyond Fidel."

United Nations, Sep 29, 2016 (Inter Press Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- On Friday, a group of 134 developing nations, known as the Group of 77 (G77), came together for a meeting to address challenges and solutions in achieving sustainable development. In attendance were G-77 Foreign Ministers, the President of the General Assembly, the UN Secretary-General and other UN senior officials.

During the 40th Annual Meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha, whose country is currently Chair of the group, highlighted the need to translate the vision of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into concrete action in line with developing nations' needs and interests.

TD 
	

"There is no one size fits all approach for development," he told delegates.

Prime Minister Chan-o-cha pointed to several resources to ensure the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including human resources.

"Human beings are full of potential and are the source of innovation and creativity. The challenge is how to tap that potential," he said. Prime Minister Chan-o-cha looked to education and the improvement of quality of life as ways to build human capacity.

Another key challenge that arose during the meeting was ensuring equal participation of developing nations in discussions and solutions.

Prime Minister Chan-o-cha expressed his delight in being invited for the first time to the recent G20 Summit in China and called it an "opportunity" for the G77 and developing nations to be heard. However, he still stressed the need to build a global partnership within and beyond developing nations.

"Thailand, as a Chair of the Group, is working as a bridge-builder among all actors that share the same goal in creating a better world, a world without poverty," he stated. He added that developed nations should assist G77 countries through short-term assistance and capacity building to pave the way for a long-term outcome with the group's needs in mind.

During the meeting The Kingdom of Thailand made a contribution of 520,000 US dollars to the Perez-Guerrero Trust Fund (PGTF) for South-South Cooperation. The fund supports economic and technical cooperation among developing countries.

President of the 71st Session of the General Assembly (GA) Peter Thomson particularly underlined the importance of cooperation within the Global South.

"South-South cooperation represents the best expression of solidarity and interdependence among developing countries, and will be pivotal in complementing North-South, public and private SDG-implementation initiatives," he told delegates in his opening address.

Thomson was Fiji's Permanent Representative to the UN, making him the first GA President from the Pacific Islands. Fiji is also a member of the G77.

Ecuador's Minister of Foreign Affairs Guillaume Long told delegates that there needs to be a "re-founding" of the multilateral system in order to increase solidarity.

"We need a UN with more voices and fewer vetoes," he stated.

"The Global South's cause is a universal cause for all mankind," Long continued.

Ecuador is next in line for chairmanship of the G77 in January 2017, which marks the first time the country will assume the position.

The G77, which began with 77 nations, has since grown to include 134 member states from around the world. It has become the largest intergovernmental organisation of developing countries in the UN, allowing the Global South to express their needs and promote cooperation for development.

Both Thomson and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon noted that the G77 is an "indispensable" and "invaluable" partner of the UN.

Thailand will continue as chair of the G77 until the end of December 2016.

During the meeting Prime Minister Chan-o-cha also presented an award to G77Executive Secretary Mourad Ahmia to express appreciation for his leadership andsupport provided by the G77 Secretariat team to the Kingdom of Thailand as Chair country and to all the Member States.

HD 	Time for Africa to Push for Global South Voices At the UN Decision Making Table [analysis]

Sep 23, 2016 (The Conversation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Heads of states and governments have been meeting for the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The main themes under discussion were: the international refugee and migrant crisis; a progress report on the UN's sustainable development goals; climate change; global health and the UN Secretary General's peace building fund.

While these are viewed as the immediate threats to global peace and security, their impact is felt most acutely in the global south. And more specifically, within Africa.

TD 
	

The refugee and migrant crisis loomed large at the General Assembly. But it appears only to have made it to the top of the agenda in the wake of an influx of refugees and asylum seekers into Europe.

The truth is that a large number of African countries have suffered the predicaments associated with the refugee problem for decades. Almost 80% of the world's refugees are hosted in poor countries, mostly in Africa. The number is constantly growing because of violent conflicts, famine and political instability. In the past few weeks the number of refugees from South Sudan was reported to have surpassed the one million mark.

It's good news that refugees made it to the top of the agenda. But the fact that the issue was prioritised because of the Europe migrant crisis appears to fit into a pattern of continued disregard for Africa's concerns, especially by the UN Security Council. Africa's view on how best to approach a range of issues - from peace and security challenges to development goals - count for nought.

The negative implications of this disconnect can be felt across a wide range of issues. It's within this context that there's a need for high spirited advocacy for better representation of Africa and other regions of the global south in the UN Security Council.

The UN Security Council is at any one time composed of five permanent veto wielding powers and 10 non-permanent members. They are elected by the General Assembly with a two-year mandate.

Africa's voice ignored

The truth is that Africa, despite the rambling annual speeches of its leaders at the UN, is rarely heard when it comes to decision making. This is the preserve of the Security Council, the sole and ultimate decision making organ of the General Assembly's deliberations.

The negative implications of the disconnect between Africa and the power houses at the UN is perhaps best illustrated by the current cynical situation in Libya.

In the wake of the Arab Spring that spread to Libya, the African Union persistently called for a peaceful political solution in resolving the Libyan crisis. But the UN Security Council unilaterally adopted resolution 1973 in March 2011. The resolution called for the use of "all necessary measures" to protect civilians against Muammar Gaddafi's forces. This paved the way for NATO's military actions.

The consequence, in the aftermath of Libya's bombing, has been the destruction of the country's state system. This is the genesis of a protracted regional socioeconomic and political crisis across the Sahel region and beyond. The Sahel region is a belt running through about 10 countries, from western to the eastern part of Africa. It is sandwiched between the Sahara desert to the north and savanna to the south.

Another example revolves around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This year marked the first anniversary of the adoption of the 17 goals. The UN forum reviewed the successes and challenges of goals projected to be attained by the year 2030. Their eventual attainment under the draft Addis Ababa Action Agenda relies heavily on new investments.

For these radical and transformative goals to be achieved, Africa needs to be well represented at the top echelons of UN decision making organs and agencies. This is especially important given that the SDGs are not legally binding. Their integration into regional and national development blueprints would therefore ensure that they are in sync with the UN agenda.

The other key agenda at the General Assembly was global health, with a specific focus on antimicrobial resistance. The urgency of this issue is amplified by the fact that this was only the fourth assembly in the UN's history to discuss global health challenges.

The devastating impact of antimicrobial resistance in Africa and other developing countries was recently highlighted by the World Health Organisation's specialist Dr Keiji Fukuda. He projected that, at the current rate of infections, antimicrobial resistance is likely to claim more lives than cancer by 2050.

This is likely to be a major blow to mostly developing countries, in particular poorly resourced Africa. This requires closer collaboration and involvement of the continent's leadership in key UN organs and agencies with African countries.

What the African Union can do

However, the push for permanent representation for Africa on the UN Security Council needs to be intrinsic. This should involve a genuine concern by African leaders and policy makers to position the continent as a key global actor. This should be motivated not by self-aggrandisement but by a genuine desire to improve ordinary Africans' welfare.

For a start, the African Union should adopt a common foreign policy framework. This would ensure that the continent has a voice in the resolutions taken by the UN Security Council, which often have an impact on the continent.

The ongoing campaign for the leadership of the World Health Organisation is one step in the right direction. Africa has rallied behind the candidature of Dr Tedros Adhanon as its preferred candidate for director-general.

On its part, the Security Council should be more open to reforms in keeping with the shifting international balance of power. This is likely to guard the UN against repeating political, constitutional and legal mistakes that led to the collapse of its predecessor, the League of Nations.

The contemporary leaders of the victorious countries in the post-war era, who were vanguard states at the time that the UN was formed, must understand that the world is steadily transitioning to a multipolar systemic balance of power. The UN Security Council needs to reflect and be a truer representative of the emerging faces and voices of a contemporary "United Nations".

Geneva, May 22, 2016 (Inter Press Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- In my personal capacity as an academic from the Global South and a retired international civil servant, I undertook a study for the Geneva Centre for Human Rights Advancement and Global Dialogue which was published in November 2014. This was at a time when I had no idea that I would later become a member of this elite group of Special Procedures Mandate Holder. The study is entitled "In Defence of Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council: An alternative narrative from the South".

The study makes the point that this mechanism was first initiated by the South and that the countries of different regions of the South share with those of the North the paternity of this innovative way of ensuring independent monitoring of human rights worldwide. They all consequently have an equal right to contribute to enhancing the efficiency of this mechanism.

TD 
	

The study indicates how one can remove the barrage of objections raised by countries or groups headquartered in the North who believe they are the self-appointed defenders of Special Procedures. They have tended to act in the past as if any suggestion for improvement of Special Procedures coming from the Global South can only be motivated by a desire to undermine the independence and integrity of the said mechanisms.

In other words, this study is an appeal to the North whether to Governments or to civil society organisations from the North that they accept to discuss with the South such suggestions on their merits. It would warrant engaging with those who hold different views and seeking to broaden areas of consensus through bridge-building as our Chairman emphasized in his opening remarks rather than through "excommunication"!

I will raise five central issues:

First, the process of selection of mandate-holders: the study reviews the process of selection of mandate-holders which has been improved as an outcome of the 2010 -2011 HRC review process. Henceforth the President of the Council has to give reasons if he decides to disregard the recommendations of the Consultative Group concerning the list of appointees. This adjustment indeed makes for greater transparency but it does not insulate the President from backroom political pressure from powerful quarters.

Why could we not, in cases where paralysis or postponement threaten, put the appointment of the mandate holders to a vote? There has been no disastrous effect resulting from the fact that their counterparts in treaty bodies are selected by ballot. Are they less objective or independent because of that? Candidates could campaign, offer plans of action indicating what they would do if elected. Many methods exist to ensure equitable gender and geographic distribution.

Second, the review, rationalisation and improvement of mandates.

The challenge here is to change the cluster of 77 Special Procedure Mandate Holders into a system. This is what the Council was mandated to do by General Assembly Resolution 60/25, o.p. 6, which directed it to "where necessary improve and rationalize all mandates (... ) in order to maintain a system of Special Procedures".

Why has this not happened? There are currently 77 mandate holders as against 44 when HRC was established and on current trends their numbers will reach 100 in ten years' time. No provisions for a sunset clause, for mergers or absorption are in the cards.

If each mandate, of which there are now over 55 including SPs in working groups and with numbers growing year on year, interact with States on top of other Human Rights mechanisms, this can become an administrative nightmare for smaller and least developed countries.

Some claim ballooning of Special Procedures has a political explanation: each special procedure has a virtual national flag on it and to eliminate, merge it or otherwise change it may be seen as an offence to the initiating country which continues to enjoy special rights over the fate of the mandate.

Be that as it may, the numbers of Special Procedures keep increasing, never dovetailing but rather duplicating with pre-existing mandates. There is obvious overlap, for instance, between the mandates on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the one on contemporary forms of slavery including its causes and consequences and the mandate on the sale of children, child prostitution and pornography.

Likewise CEDAW having defined violence as a form of discrimination against women, it's hard to explain why one needs two mandates, one on discrimination against women and the other on violence against women.

While these mandates have Northern roots, the initiating countries from the South are not immune to such tendencies. Thus there is an obvious link between the mandate of promoting a democratic and equitable international order, the mandate dealing with foreign debt and that related to human rights and international solidarity.

I recommend a revitalisation of the RRI process in an open ended working group of the Council.

As a staying measure, the Council should start by requiring initiators of new mandates to answer such questions as:

- is there no other UN mechanism which addresses in part or in whole the issue proposed?

- is there not a Special Procedure which covers partly or wholly this issue?

- if so why not adjust the existing mandate for this purpose?

- could the new mandate not replace an existing mandate?

In parallel, the working group would review "all existing" thematic mandates to promote coherence, avoid duplication, determine protection gaps and determine whether the distribution of SPs between individual mandates and working groups is still appropriate.

Third, the enhancement of the cooperation between States and Special Procedures

General Assembly resolution 65/281 of 17 June 2011reiterating other similar positions incorporated in resolution 60/251 and in the Code of Conduct of Special Procedures stipulates that "The Special Procedures shall continue to foster a constructive dialogue with States" (emphasis added). In its para. 94, the MOSP reiterates this commitment but then illustrates it by saying "It is thus appropriate that reminders be sent to Governments in relation to unanswered correspondence".

Mandate holders are also urged "to follow up on replies provided by the Governments in order to request further clarification... ". Surely a constructive dialogue can go beyond sending registered letters and asking for more clarification.

Real dialogue involves give and take. Why not for instance ask the CC and the 5 geographic representatives of States members of the Council to consult on how para. 94 of the MOSP could be made to reflect not only the letter but also the spirit of UNGA resolution 65/281.

Fourth is the broader issue of how the Human Rights Council can interact with Special Procedures on issues of methodology.

This interaction has to reconcile the accountability of Special Procedures to the Council which appoints them with the full independence of judgement of these mandate-holders in the pursuit of their monitoring mission.

The following kinds of issues have been raised in the recent past which have not found an optimal solution:

Can a Special Procedure Mandate Holder, in the legitimate context of his right to select studies to present to the Council, also question initiatives under discussion by the Council itself without being requested to do so?

If a Special Procedure is mandated by the Council to present a report on a particular issue at a specified session of the Council, may he replace such report by a study that he considers as taking precedence over the mandated theme without consulting the Bureau of the Council?

May a Special Procedure or a commission of enquiry mandated by the Council to present to it a report on a specific theme, report to the General Assembly thereon before reporting to the Council without specific authority to do so?

Should Special Procedures who also interact with the General Assembly of with the Security Council also report to the Human Rights Council thereon?

Many other such questions may crop up from time to time.

During the 2010-2011 review process, all groups of countries of the Global South proposed that some form of advisory body of independent jurists could be consulted on an ad hoc basis to address these procedural issues and free more time in the Council for debates on the substance of human rights promotion and protection.

This view held by a majority of developing nations deserves respect even in case of disagreement. And indeed it was objected to by the Global North, whether at the governmental or at the NGO level, who claimed this was tantamount to imposing an Ethics Committee on Special Procedures.

Pending progress towards greater understanding between North and South on this issue, it is suggested that such issues be discussed at an annual joint meeting of the Coordinating Committee of Special Procedures with the 5 regional representatives of the geographic regions recognized by the Council. They would consult on solutions to such procedural issues including linkages between relevant GA or HRC resolutions and paragraphs 94, 102 and 105 of MOSP.

Fifth, what future structure and funding for Special Procedures?

The dissemination of thematic and country mandates between different divisions or branches of OHCHr in the past has been a cause for concern about the preservation of the independence of Special Procedures. So has their authority to fund-raise individually as per paragraph 11 of MOSP.

The latter question has been addressed recently as Special Procedures are now asked to disclose and report on the support they obtain directly in cash or in kind from outside donors. This report should be submitted to HRC in the context of standard financial reporting.

HD 	Better Mental Health in the Global South: Key Resources

Mar 17, 2016 (SciDev.Net/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Many free, useful resources are available online on various aspects of mental health. The following are some key organisations and resources.

The global burden

TD 
	

The WHO leads on providing technical advice on mental health. Its mental health atlas sets out country-by-country baseline data on measures of burden, services and governance, including suicide rates and human resources. The WHO's Mental health action plan 2013-2020 is designed to guide countries' own action plans for developing services, policies, legislation and strategies based on evidence-based practice.

A systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study looked at "years lived with disability" as a result of various health conditions in 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. It shows that depression is the second largest contributor to disability, affecting 600 million people globally. A map in The Economist using this data shows depression to be the leading cause of years lived with disability in the Indian subcontinent and in much of Africa.

Suicide affects poor people disproportionately: 75 per cent of the estimated 800,000 suicides a year occur in low- and middle-income countries, according to a WHO webpage on suicide statistics.

An article introducing a 2007 Lancet series on mental health explains the link with physical conditions. It argues that because this link has been overlooked, statisticians have probably underestimated how much of the global burden of disease is linked to mental health conditions.

Another article in the same series describes how the problem is compounded in the global South by inadequate resources for mental health, inequity in their distribution and inefficiencies in how they are used. A recent Guardian report summarises this nicely.

Risk factors including conflict and disease

In its 2012 report Risks to mental health, the WHO says determinants for poor mental health fall into three broad groups: personality issues such as poor self-esteem; social circumstances including bereavement and poverty; and environmental factors such as exposure to conflict and disease.

A separate WHO report explores these risk factors and argues that mental health issues cannot be considered separately from other areas of development. A review article examines the link between poverty and suicide, personality and mood disorders.

Both mild and severe mental disorders are common where people are affected by disasters or conflict. The WHO and UNHCR (the UN refugee agency) have published mental health assessment tools and guidance for use by staff working in humanitarian emergencies.

A paper on the mental health consequences of war reviews evidence of these impacts in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Chechnya in Russia, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Uganda. And according to medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, the incidence of severe mental disorders among Syrian refugees who have fled to Iraq doubled between 2012 and 2013. A 2015 review by the UNHCR describes the impact of the crisis on Syrians' mental health.

The mental health impact of crises can be long-lasting: Nature reports that healthcare workers are still struggling to help families in West Africa as a result of Ebola. This is partly due to the lack of healthcare staff, according to a comment article in The Journal of the American Medical Association.

The profound psychological impacts on children and adolescents were discussed in a symposium convened last year by UNICEF (the UN Children's Fund) and others.

And a paper in International Health, part of a special issue on global mental health [link to PDFs], reviews trends in humanitarian crises and documents a shift in focus from measuring burden to documenting the effectiveness of interventions to thinking about how to deliver care.

Culture, stigma and attitudes

Culture affects how mental disorders are viewed and the stigma that people with mental issues can experience. It also affects how patients describe clinical syndromes and accept treatments - an article in Scientific American explores the effect of culture on how mental illness is labelled.

Stigma is often a significant issue. In an article exploring cultural perspectives and attitudes in Nigeria, the author says mentally ill Nigerians will rarely seek conventional medical treatment because they believe their condition has a supernatural cause.

In much of Africa, social stigma means mental illness is a "silent epidemic", according to an article on social and cultural aspects of mental health on the continent. Stigma can be influenced by how people perceive the cause of the disorder, which itself is strongly influenced by culture - for example a condition might be less stigmatised if it is believed to have a genetic origin, according to a study in Chinese Americans.

Because beliefs about mental health in developing countries can differ from those associated with Western medicine services need to be offered in a culturally sensitive way. A review article examines the challenges of doing this to create 'fit for purpose' interventions.

And another paper provides a culturally sensitive framework for psychosocial intervention that has since been widely applied. There are also non-traditional ways of tackling stigma. One example is Kenya's leading psychiatrist, Frank Njenga, who uses a TV talk show to promote better understanding of conditions such as schizophrenia and substance abuse.

Addressing needs in the global South

Mental health expert Vikram Patel has argued that low-income countries cannot effectively use Western-style models of mental health care, arguing instead that they should deliver treatment through the primary healthcare system.

A review article summarises strategies to overcome barriers to scaling up mental health services.

The WHO has made a serious effort to scale up global action by launching its Mental Health Gap Action Programme. Through a systematic review of evidence and consultation with experts, the Mental Health Gap Intervention Guide provides decision tools and treatment advice for non-specialists working in resource-poor settings. [1] In some countries, such as Sierra Leone, the guide is being used to train psychiatric nurses.

The WHO has also published toolkits for the clinical management of disorders and for assessing the mental health needs of people in emergency situations. In response to the West African Ebola epidemic, it also published toolkits for field workers giving psychological first aid, and a guide on providing psychosocial support. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a page of mental health resource links for those affected by a disaster. A 2015 UNHCR report, also cited above, offers information on sociocultural issues to guide staff offering psychosocial support to Syrian people.

The UN's Sustainable Development Goals include promoting mental wellbeing, with some advocating for stronger action via the umbrella campaign #FundaMentalSDG. In April 2016, the WHO and World Bank will hold a global mental health meeting to mobilise a coalition to scale up the implementation of interventions.

Organisations working for better mental health

Several organisations and networks in addition to those mentioned above work to improve mental health worldwide.

The Gulbenkian Global Mental Health Platform supports the UN summit on mental health and offers advice on scaling up services in developing countries. The Movement for Global Mental Health is a network that is calling for action to scale up services, which often means more community involvement.

The Mental Health Innovation Network is a community of mental health innovators that offers access to a database of more than 100 research-based innovations across the globe, from Palestine to Uganda.

The World Federation for Mental Health is a membership organisation focusing on grass-roots advocacy and public education on mental health issues.

PRIME (programme for improving mental health care) is a consortium of research institutions and ministries of health in Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa and Uganda.

The Centre for Global Mental Health - a collaboration between King's College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in the United Kingdom - runs 40 research projects to improve access to mental healthcare in developing countries. A programme at Columbia University, United States, also provides mental health research and training on a global scale. And the US National Institute of Mental Health has set up a collaborative network of regional hubs for interdisciplinary research in mental health.

The UN's Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict highlights the effects of war on children. The UK-based charity War Child offers both practical and psychological support to children in conflict areas.

Jan 21, 2016 (AfricaFocus/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Editor's Note

"There is a renewed and stronger assault on seed ... based on legal systems that permit exclusive rights over seeds on the spurious contention that plant varieties were 'discovered' and improved on. But these 'discovered' varieties are the product of the whole history of collective human improvements and maintenance carried out by peasants. To assert exclusive rights over the whole on the basis of small adjustments is nothing short of outright theft." - SouthSouth Dialogue, Durban, South Africa, November 2015

TD 
	

In rich countries, debate about industrialized agriculture often focuses on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and the safety and transparency consequences for consumers. In developing countries with large sectors of peasant farmers, this is only a small part of a larger debate on the future of agriculture, pitting multinational companies and large-scale investors against the autonomy and rights of peasant farmers. Land grabbing is highly visible, and has attracted much international attention. Less visible, and potentially even more damaging, is the appropriation of rights to seeds, fueled not only by the companies themselves but also by a concerted campaign to erode farmers' traditional rights to seeds in favor of patents by multinational corporations. This is a issue not only for GMOs, but also for other seeds produced by other breeding technologies.

The debate is filled with acronyms, as well as the claim that "scientific" agriculture will provide food and development benefiting the peasants as well. And the campaign to change laws and erode traditional rights is unrelenting. It is based on the Universal Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV 91), which works for the privatization of seeds by imposing intellectual property rights on plant varieties.

In recent years a drive to extend these laws on "plant variety protection" in African and other developing countries has rapidly accelerated.

This Africa Focus Bulletin contains a recent declaration by groups resisting this drive, and excerpts from a brief article by Dr. Carol Thompson, noting the apartheid-like differential effect of these laws. Also included (just below) are linked to other essential resources on this issue.

Declaration on Plant Variety Protection and Seed Laws from the South-South Dialogue

Durban, South Africa

29 November 2015

http://www.acbio.org.za - direct URL: http://tinyurl.com/j5uxvkc

We, participants at the South-South Dialogue, are members of peasant and civil society organisations and concerned individuals from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe working on issues of food and seed sovereignty, peasants' control of seed production and exchange, and biodiversity. We gathered in Durban, South Africa 27-29 November 2015 to share information and knowledge, and to come to a common understanding on seed and plant variety protection (PVP) policy and laws and strategies for resistance and alternatives in the global South.

We are working in our countries and regions to advance the ongoing global struggle for socially just and ecologically sustainable societies, in which farming households and communities have control and decision-making power over the production and distribution of food and seed.

Human societies and the seeds we use to produce the food that sustains us have grown symbiotically over millennia. Seeds emerged from nature and have been diversified, conserved, nurtured and enhanced through processes of human experimentation, discovery and innovation throughout this time. Seeds have been improved by means of traditional and cultural knowledge transmitted from generation to generation. Seeds are therefore the collective heritage for people serving humanity. Peasants and indigenous peoples have always been the custodians and guardians of the collective knowledge embedded in the wide diversity of seed that has enabled the development of humankind as a species.

However, today capitalist greed poses fundamental threats to the continued conservation, reproduction and use of the biological diversity nurtured for all this time. The forced enclosure of land and other natural resources and its capture and conversion into private property was one disastrous step. This has caused and continues to cause social dislocation and displacement, damaging the social fabric of human societies, severing the connection between people and the land, and consolidating social, collectively-produced wealth in the hands of the few at the expense of the many.

There is a renewed and stronger assault on seed, agricultural biodiversity heritage and the knowledge associated with these. Related law and policy making processes are already far advanced in Europe, the United States and other parts of the world and are being imposed on our countries in the South through multilateral and bilateral trade and investment agreements. They are based on legal systems that permit exclusive rights over seeds on the spurious contention that plant varieties were 'discovered' and improved on. But these 'discovered' varieties are the product of the whole history of collective human improvements and maintenance carried out by peasants. To assert exclusive rights over the whole on the basis of small adjustments is nothing short of outright theft.

Efforts to expand this expropriation to the global South are being pursued aggressively by multinational seed and life sciences corporations and their cohorts in state and multilateral institutions. This takes the form of a coordinated political and technocratic crusade to impose uniform and draconian laws and regulations in favour of intellectual property (IP) rights such as plant variety protection (PVP) for private interests, the proliferation of genetically modified (GM) seeds, and exclusive recognition and marketing of seed and plant varieties that pass through breeding and production systems tightly controlled by economic elites.

There are no benefits for peasant and farming households and communities, or for society in general, from these developments. In a few short decades - just a small fraction of the time humans have been engaged in industrial agriculture - this enclosure of the collective seed heritage has spread virulently across the globe. The historical practices of context-specific peasant-managed seed systems we have relied on are vilified, denigrated as being backward and obsolete, and criminalised. Farmers are taken to court and imprisoned for maintaining the biological base as a living system while seed and food corporations make huge profits legitimised by seed and IP laws.

The result is the alarming erosion of agricultural biodiversity and related knowledge, and a deepening threat to the sustainable use of the genetic base, and consequently to food production and ecological balance, and to humanity. Current seed and IP laws violate the ethos of sharing between farmers, which is the backbone of peasant farming systems, seed and people's sovereignty and the basic human right to food.

We cannot stand by passively and watch this legalised dispossession and destruction. We are compelled to resist. We declare our commitment to work in alliance with one another, with peasant and indigenous peoples' movements, and with other likeminded civil society organisations and individuals, to fight the spread of this aggressive and violent system of domination on the basis of autonomy, collective self-organisation, cooperation, sharing, solidarity and mutual respect.

We declare our principled opposition to any form of IP on life forms, seeds and related information or exclusive rights to their use. We reject genetic modification and other current and emerging proprietary technologies in agriculture as these technologies are built on the disintegration of holistic farming systems, the exclusion of farmers from processes of plant breeding and natural resource management, and the control of seeds and planting material in the hands of corporate and political elites.

We reject the imposition of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on its country members, through the Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, to adopt rules allowing the privatization of seeds and related knowledge. We reject the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) type laws and other intellectual property regulation on seeds and plant varieties. It is also unacceptable that bilateral free trade agreements impose on Southern countries intellectual property measures that go beyond the provisions of the WTO.

We are opposed to laws dealing with the marketing and certification of seed. These new seed laws undermine peasant seed systems that have been developed locally over generations of farmers and are geared towards creating massively increased private sector participation in seed trade. In addition, these laws promote only one type of seed breeding. The entire orientation of these seed laws is geared towards genetically uniform, commercially bred varieties in terms of seed quality control and variety registration. What is very clear is that these laws criminalise the marketing of farmers' varieties. The ultimate aim of these laws is to facilitate new markets for commercial seed companies and the occupation by multinationals in the seed sector in the global south and displace and criminalise peasant seed systems.

We oppose the fragmentation of genetic information and the divorce of this information from physical resources through the Global Information Systems (GIS) such as DivSeek (a global information system on genetic sequencing and related knowledge for seed, proposed by the World Bank), since there is the possibility of the use of this information expediting the further privatisation of seeds through international legal systems.

We will fight for laws, policies and public programmes that support and strengthen peasants and communities to continue with their diverse and context-specific practices of plant breeding, selection, production and distribution. We will fight for a more responsible role for public sector activities based on ongoing democratic, participatory and transparent processes of engagement with citizens and inhabitants of our countries and regions. We will continue to defend our rights to produce, use, exchange and sell all seed and planting material. We will work to recover, maintain and expand the use of native and local seed, and the revival of diverse food cultures as the most effective routes to protect biodiversity. We recognise the irreducible diversity that can only be managed through peasant seed production systems and maintained by peasants as breeders and users of seed.

We believe seeds are the people's heritage in the service of humanity that should be managed collectively, democratically and sustainably. We reaffirm the centrality of agricultural producers as the primary stewards of our collective genetic resources, especially women peasants who continue to play a direct role in the maintenance and enhancement of these resources. We commit to supporting peasant households and communities in their stewardship, and to building links with allies, wherever we may find them, to advance the cause of food and seed sovereignty.

Apartheid Seed Law

Carol B. Thompson

Pambazuka News, June 3, 2015

[Excerpts only: for full text and references with explicit comparisons to apartheid laws, see the original text at http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category.php/features/94834]

[Carol Thompson is a professor emerita at Northern Arizona University, a member of AGRA-Watch in Seattle, Washington, and coauthor with Andrew Mushita of Biopiracy of Biodiversity: Global Exchange as Enclosure, which was featured in AfricaFocus after its publication in 2007.]

Although political apartheid was dismantled by the 1994 election of President Nelson Mandela, a new form of economic apartheid is now stalking the entire African continent.

This new economic apartheid refers to the seed convention known as UPOV 91 (International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants), advanced by the European Union, the United States, and the World Bank presuming to protect plant breeders' rights under the World Trade Organization. The EU is requiring its implementation by African governments as a prerequisite for trading under the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), scheduled for 2016.

UPOV91 gives exclusive proprietary rights to plant breeders, who work in modern laboratories full of expensive equipment. The convention gives these breeders, or their corporate sponsors, private ownership over a new strain, extending property rights beyond the seed, to the full plant, and to "essentially derived" products (e.g., flour from wheat).

To obtain this legal ownership, the new variety must be distinct, uniform, and stable (DUS), characteristics not found in farmers' newly bred varieties after their experimentation in the fields. It means that farmers' new varieties are not protected by the UPOV convention and remain free for the taking.

Farmer breeders do not desire seed traits that are highly stable, for they are looking for nuances in traits in order to choose the next seeds for breeding. As one farmer asked, "what do they mean by 'heritage seed'? Aren't the seeds changing all the time?"

During the 20 years of proprietary rights for breeders of DUS varieties, no one can exchange, use, experiment or save the seed without permission, a prohibition eradicating farmers' rights to work with any seeds. Because farmers have cultivated diverse food crops over millennia, two international laws protect farmers' rights (International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity). For African governments to incorporate UPOV91 into national laws, they would have to violate these two treaties.

Farmers' experimentation and freely sharing involve not only seeds but the indigenous knowledge embedded in them. African farmers, for example, know the hundreds of varieties of millets and sorghums or teff, grains more nutritious than maize or rice or wheat, and ones that are regaining interest on the continent because they grow well in semi-arid conditions, while the more familiar maize varieties are not standing up to climate change aridity. Smallholder African farmers grow 20-25 crops on one hectare, sharing knowledge-sometimes formally in farmer field schools but also daily in informal ways-about which variety grows best under another crop, where to place the various crops in terms of moisture percolation in the small field, and especially, variable planting times in case the rains come late, or start early. Farmers know the nutrition value of their biodiverse crops, encouraging children and mothers to partake more of one (e.g., pearl and finger millets) than of another (cassava). And nutrition includes feeding the living soil with leguminous plants rotated with grain crops.

Why would anyone want to destroy farmers' experimentation and knowledge? For the same reason apartheid reigned too long: it is profitable. UPOV91 offers another way to privatize a living organism, accomplished more easily than the difficult job of enforcing a patent across the globe.

[The following comparisons make clear the parallel to apartheid laws, in establishing unequal rights to access to resources that are essential for human survival.]

Segregation with inferiority

UPOV91 is trying to establish, by law, the inferior status of smallholder farmers who breed and do scientific experiments in the field. It legitimizes the corporate plant breeders' entitlement and presumed superiority. The normative law translates back into profit for the corporations benefiting from PVP - plant variety protection. This constructed distinction between two different types of breeding becomes a "ritual of truth".

Aesthetics of segregation

UPOV91 legitimizes the view that "real plant breeders" wear white coats and work in a sparkling laboratory with the latest instruments, while projecting that farmer breeders working in the soil are inferior. Because they cannot produce DUS (distinct, uniform, stable) seeds, they are not breeders. The Gates Foundation's Program for African Seed Systems (PASS) call farmers' seeds "weak" and "recycled", "used for decades". Like apartheid benches "for whites only" in the parks and on the beaches, only a breeder of DUS seeds can sit on the laboratory stool as a recogn1zed seed breeder; farmer breeders do not qualify.

Legal enforcement of apartheid

The pass laws, restricting the movement of Africans at all times, became a core impetus for organ1zing against apartheid from the Defiance Campaign (1952) through "making the townships ungovernable" (1980s). Any "non-white" without a pass could be detained for 90 days, or more, without trial or notification of any lawyer.

Farmer breeders will not be summarily detained, but Canada has already made violation of its UPOV-based law a criminal act, not a civil offense. The U.S. courts have upheld Monsanto's allegations against hundreds of farmers that they stole a "Monsanto gene", when most often, pollen carried by wind fertilized the farmers' crops. With these precedents, the economic apartheid of UPOV91 will most likely be strictly enforced by the courts.

Resistance

Civil society and farmers across the African continent are organizing against UPOV91, but the threat of the looming European trade agreements (EPAs) remains. Just as civil society resistance in the North changed the context for domestic apartheid, the international community needs to voice and organize rejection of this apartheid seed law.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization recognizes two seed systems: the formal one and farmers', because all breeders are essential to cultivate new food varieties in this time of climate change. Further, farmers are more advanced breeders because their new seeds are already "field tested", whereas laboratory-bred seeds often fail during field trials, not expressing the traits desired. Let us not allow UPOV to gain any "sensibility of normalcy" in segregating and denigrating farmer seed breeders:

The international community's vociferous and sustained rejection of this new economic apartheid would protect the future of food for us all.

HD 	Climate Change Adaptation Is Not Just About Vulnerable Countries [analysis]

Dec 30, 2015 (African Arguments/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- There are unsustainable cities in the Global North as well as the Global South. Real adaptation means hard choices in wealthier countries too.

In the climate change talks recently concluded in Paris, the final agreement included a goal to raise some $100 billion for adaptation and mitigation efforts in the world's most vulnerable countries.

TD 
	

While the idea of 'adaptation' was initially shunned by activists as giving up on mitigation, it was accepted as necessary at the 2009 Copenhagen climate meeting when experts and policymakers acknowledged that some level of climate change was unavoidable.

Adaptation is now seen as a central part of climate change efforts, framed as a transfer from rich to poor countries to enable people in the Global South to adjust to challenging circumstances. However, it says little about wealthier nations and their own unsustainable conditions.

When it comes to urban adaptation, for instance, cities such as Gaborone in Botswana are likely victims of climate change and deserve adaptation support. But that's only one side of the puzzle.

Other metropoles such as Phoenix, USA, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, are similarly part of the problem of too many people living in arid places. While conservation is critical, the time has come for adaption in the Global North as well and for some governments to actively encourage people to resettle in more well-watered areas of their countries.

Going dry

When Botswana gained independence from the UK in 1966, it didn't have a capital city as it had been administered from a locale in South Africa.

After surveying potential locations in this dryland nation, planners built Gaborone in south-eastern Botswana near one of the few places with adequate rainfall and a site for a dam that could supply the city with water. It also helped that the city was located in a more densely populated part of the country and along a railway constructed in the colonial era.

Now, some 50 years later, the dam supplying water for this city of roughly 250,000 people has gone dry and residents of Gaborone endure water rationing. Six out of the last 10 years have been drought years, with average rainfall in the Gaborone area declining from 530 mm per annum in the 20th century to 450mm in more recent years.

While the reasons for Gaborone's dwindling water supply are complex, shifting rainfall patterns related to climate change and a burgeoning urban population explain much of the shortage. Downscaled climate change models suggest that the situation will grow even worse in the decades to come.

The Government of Botswana has not taken this problem sitting down, building a north-south water carrier in 2000, extending some 360 km to the northeast to transport water from reservoirs built along the Motloutse and Shashe tributaries of the Limpopo River. The pipeline is now being extended to bring in water from the newly constructed Dikgatlhong Dam further up the Shashe River.

Botswana has been able to undertake such measures because it is a middle-income country that has astutely managed its diamond mining industry and invested heavily in public services. It has also cooperated with its neighbours in order to gain legal access to surface water from the region's rivers.

But while the government is handling these challenging circumstances, one might reasonably ask how fair it is for it alone to shoulder the costs of such water transfers when global climate change - largely brought about by the emissions of others - has left this nation's capital city high and dry.

Unsustainable from the start

The new climate change agreement struck in Paris purports to help cities like Gaborone adapt to such change.

However, what is happening in Botswana also raises uncomfortable questions for other dryland cities, especially those in wealthier countries that rarely attract the attention of environment and development experts. What about metropoles that have never, even without climate change, been in sites with favourable physical attributes such as access to fresh water and a hospitable climate?

Take the case of Phoenix, USA, which currently relies on a vast network of dams and aqueducts across the western part of the country to supply water to its 4.5 million person metro area, the twelfth largest in the country.

The entire western USA has been plagued by drought for much of the past 10 years and water demand from Phoenix and other cities has so drained the Colorado River that neighbouring Mexico rarely sees a trickle from this waterway.

The location of Phoenix was neither chosen for extremely favourable site conditions nor a situational trade advantage.

Rather it was initially built on the back of an agricultural economy supported by large scale irrigation resulting from political decisions for dam-based development of semi-arid areas in the western USA. The city's more recent growth has been fuelled by air conditioning, heat seeking retirees, and an influx of high tech companies.

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with 5.7 million people, is another dryland city seriously challenged by water scarcity.

The level of investment in Riyadh, and its capital city status, has little or nothing to do with desirable site or situation characteristics as it has always had limited fresh water resources and is not at the centre of major transportation networks. Rather, its position reflects the fact that this is the ancestral home of the Saudi ruling family.

What is remarkable about Riyadh is that it is increasingly supplied with desalinated water pumped from the Persian Gulf over a distance of 467 km.

While the Saudi government has the resources to support this type of infrastructure, there are periods when water is rationed because of inadequate supplies. Thornier still is the politically charged question of how sustainable is a major city that increasingly relies on energy intensive desalination, a process that is not only expensive, but generates significant greenhouse gas emissions.

Global support for urban adaptation to global climate change is often framed as a way for people in the Global South to adjust to challenging circumstances, but it says little about cities in the wealthier nations that may be structurally unsustainable because of their arid locations.

While conservation is critical, because it is far cheaper and more environmentally friendly than desalination or transporting water over long distances, there may also come a time when governments need to actively encourage people to resettle in more well-watered areas of their countries if such options exist.

Real adaptation also means hard choices in wealthier countries.

Nov 25, 2015 (Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) deeply regrets and mourns the passing away of its former president, Professor Sam Moyo. Professor Moyo was in New Delhi, India, where he was attending a conference on "Labour Questions in the Global South". The vehicle in which he was travelling was involved in a serious accident in the evening of Friday, 20 November, and Professor Moyo died in the early hours of Sunday, 22 November 2015.

TD 
	

Sam had been an active member of CODESRIA since the 1970s. He coordinated a number of CODESRIA working groups and research networks, and was a tireless and inexhaustible resource that CODESRIA heavily relied upon. Several of his most important ideas were first carried in CODESRIA publications. In 1998, he was elected Vice-President of CODESRIA. During the 12th General Assembly held in Yaounde, Cameroon in December 2008, Sam was elected President of CODESRIA, a position he held until December 2011. He continued to play a vital role in the life and work of CODESRIA, attending general assemblies, representing CODESRIA at many events, hosting activities in Harare, advising on research programmes, contributing to the deepening and broadening of intellectual exchanges across the Global South and providing wise counsel to the leadership.

Sam was Africa's leading intellectual voice on land and agrarian transformation. Over long periods when there was little policy interest in land reforms, he and a few other scholars kept the issues alive through rigorous empirical research and theorizing about Africa's land and agrarian questions in the context of globalization. Throughout an intellectual career that spanned decades and produced a massive body of work, he consistently championed the rights of Africa's smallholders as well as its landless and dispossessed communities and chronicled the struggles of agrarian social movements for equitable land rights. He followed up his research with engagements with policy makers, civil society organisations, research networks on agrarian issues as well as social movements. He was much in demand in Africa and beyond as a policy advisor on land and agrarian issues.

Sam showed great courage in his robust engagement with Zimbabwe's land reforms. He charted a course of independent research which eschewed sensationalism and illuminated the scale and significance of land redistribution represented by the Fast Track Land Reform Programme which saw over two hundred thousand Zimbabwean households acquiring land for their livelihoods. In spite of the fact that this was for a long time a very lonely undertaking, which incurred the disapproval of the different sides of the debates on Zimbabwe's land reforms, he was much respected and admired not only within CODESRIA, but in the wider community of progressive intellectuals within the global south for his consistency and the quality of the evidence he produced to back his positions. The growing acceptance of Sam's positions in the wider land and agrarian studies community sadly failed to give him full credit for his pivotal role in changing the debate about Zimbabwe's land reforms.

Sam was full of life and lived life to the full. He was warm, kind hearted, humble and respectful of every member of staff at CODESRIA. So was he with the countless numbers of younger scholars and colleagues he mentored over the years. We will miss a man of integrity, a committed pan Africanist, a loyal friend, and a great leader.

Ending his short but extremely productive journey in this world in India speaks volumes of Sam's commitment to scholarship and to the cause of the peoples of the Global South. This commitment was much in evidence in his leadership of the Agrarian South Network, a tri-continental research network on agrarian issues he co-founded with colleagues from Africa, Asia and Latin America.

On behalf of the Executive and Scientific Committees, and the staff of CODESRIA, we would like to offer our sincere condolences to Sam's partner Beatrice, his mother Madam Mavis Moyo, his daughters and his wider family and friends, to the staff of the Harare based Africa Institute of Agrarian Studies that he founded and led for many years, and to the entire CODESRIA community, which was his extended family.

Hamba Kahle, Sam. Go well.

Nov 20, 2015 (The Journalist/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Students in South Africa want to move away from curricula based solely on colonial paradigms. This, write two academics from the University of Johannesburg, presents a serious challenge to tertiary level educators.

The student protests against fee increases in the higher education system that hit campuses around the country and saw many campuses shut down amidst fear of violence and rougue actions by students have reached a temporary impasse with the decision of a 0% fees increase for next year.

TD 
	

However, we know that the students' concerns go beyond immediate financial concerns. The protest should also be seen in the context of calls for transformation of the higher education system and most importantly a de-colonialization of curricula.

In this regard, lecturers as well as university leadership will have to take seriously their engagement with their student base and start querying some of the underlying structures of our higher education system.

We need to rethink the place of higher education in relation to political, economic, social and cultural developments and trajectories hereof in South Africa and the global South and challenge ideas of the global as only referring to the global North.

While, debates about transformation in the higher education system can hardly have escaped anyone, discussions and real attempts at also transforming what we teach, how we teach it and the relevance it bears on our society and a global world order has been paid less attention. We need to engage and luister to our students around their aspirations, the relevance of curricula, and most importantly around what we teach and how we teach it.

It is time we challenge existing epistemology and ideas of truth within the disciplines that we teach and research.

It is time we dare scholars to see the inherent insularity of the ways in which many academic disciplines have created their own truths steeped in archaic, patriarchal and decidedly racialised ideas of the West and the rest.

In essence it is time that we recognise the experiences and scholarship of the global South as not only equal to the global North, but also necessary for, the advancement of global scholarship as a whole.

As such we need to find ways to rethink higher education and scholarship not only in South Africa and the post-colony but also in the global North, often held as the norm for curricula and scholarship in the global South.

The theoretical point is that deliberately or otherwise, dominant Western scholarship reflects and equates Northern histories as though the rest either do not exist or only exist to the extent that it either aids or does not interfere with Northern doctrinal theorization, denying our common humanity, shared history and future.

We propose that Western scholarship is entrenched in positions that make scholars unlikely to see beyond what the ramparts of compartmentalising social structures and institutional boundaries guide them to see.

We argue that scholars in the global North as well as the global South are blinkered by social moulds and thinking that misshape, violate and transgress against the inalienable rights of people and as such denying the ways in which people are unique beings.

In the words of writer NgA(C)gA(C) Wa Thiong'o it is time we move the centre by "swimming, towards... the sea of our connections with our common humanity".

As such we take serious, and advance, projects of de-colonialization by developing new methodologies and theory in academic scholarship and teaching curricula that breaks with existing Western dominated scholarship and epistemology. This, in order to grab hold of truths, that matter not only to the global South, but humanity as a whole.

The question is, how? How do marginalised scholars in the global South conduct research when its histories and epistemologies severely privilege Western ideas?

In Africa, as scholar Achille Mbembe says, "there is a sensory experience of our lives that encompasses innumerable unnamed and un-nameable shapes, hues and textures that 'objective knowledge' has failed to capture". Like Mbembe, we seek to open academia and scholarship up to "unforeseen directions" by proposing a way to develop new theory and knowledge that breaks with Northern orthodoxy.

To do this, we rather controversially, argue that if scholars are to break through the insularity of present Western dominated scholarship they will have to become burglars that 'smash-and-grab' valuables from established doctrinal orders.

Even in using scholarship often produced in the West, or for the West, marginalized scholars can become poachers that 'smash' trough the orthodoxy and 'grab' their own critical meanings and in the extension construct new theory and bodies of scholarship.

To break with supposed orthodox practices and ways of thinking about academic research and instead embrace the multiple possibilities for research that a 'smash and grab' epistemology opens up, we use the somewhat disturbing yet archetypical figure of the 'trickster' as an analogy for a 'smash-and-grab' approach to academic research.

By way of example, undercover journalism and 'Wallraffing' so important to investigative journalism and the uncovering of hidden truths might entail illegal actions yet be ethically permissible and necessary for a free and open societal debate. Maybe better yet is the analogy of a 'Robin Hood' that steals from the proverbial 'rich' to give to the 'poor'. We argue that here is honour when, a la Robin Hood, academics poach valuable insights and expose hidden truths in order to 'feed' the multitudes starved of a scholarship that bears, not only on them, but humanity itself.

No doubt some will be made uneasy by the use of the terms 'smash and grab'. After all, we are writing this amidst renewed conservative Western fears of the 'empire striking back' with supposed violent hordes of colonialized, provincialized and marginalized peoples smashing through Western boundaries previously the preserve, and house, of an imagined (insular) Western civilization.

As such we anticipate some defensiveness from scholars who may think that 'smash-and-grab' scholarship sounds too 'primitive'. However, what is easily lost in such narratives is that human beings, in the words of Wa Thiong'o, "use tools, technology, to wrest a living from nature".

Archaeologists have produced a solid body of work on lithic primates "smashing and grabbing" to produce tools enabling comparatively physically weak humans to shape and dominate the world.

Science works in similar ways and scientific developments show how humans have culturally evolved by enabling both normal and revolutionary ideas to emerge and smash into each other to grab hold of new insights and truths.

In essence humans have evolved and come to dominate the world through 'smashing and grabbing' in order to create conditions for survival. As such, scholars who 'smash-and-grab' for meanings and truths hidden, or yet to be established, can create bodies of work that serve their own purpose and reality.

No doubt, the development of a 'smash and grab' approach to scholarly work will take courage. It will take daring.

It will require moves that break with doctrinal Western thoughts. It will reveal uncomfortable truths but also inevitably open up possibilities for creating new scholarship that creates meanings and insights other than those emanating from the global North. Scholarship that can serve our shared present and future.

Nov 04, 2015 (South African Government/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Public lecture by the Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Mr Luwellyn Landers, at the Pontifica Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra, Dominican Republic

Distinguished guests

Members of the Media

Ladies and gentlemen

I am pleased by your attendance of this Public Lecture which seeks to reflect on South Africa's foreign policy engagements. We have decided to base our interaction on an overview of South Africa's foreign policy, its origins and manifestation.

South Africa's foreign policy orientation

Let me begin by giving a broader foreign policy orientation. In this way we should be able to reflect on its evolution, principles and key objectives. I would like to state from the onset that we share a common history of colonialism with the Dominican Republic.

This is the same historical tragedy we share with many countries on the African continent and in the global South. We had to wage a struggle which was supported by the people and leadership of the African continent, the global South and peace loving people of the entire world. Other African countries gained independence before us and likewise they supported our cause.

Our liberation movements launched the struggle for liberation from different countries across the globe and were hosted in various countries in the global South. These countries risked destabilisation and aggression by apartheid South Africa, particularly our neighbouring states referred to as Front Line States which hosted the African National Congress (ANC) and other liberation movements.

Our forebears always believed in Pan Africanism and its values which continued to inspire them until and after independence was attained. I therefore underscore that South Africa is an African country which emerged from a painful history of colonialism and apartheid.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Our struggle for democracy is well documented. It is however important to underscore the fact that upon attainment of democracy in 1994 we undertook to reverse and undo the damage of apartheid. On the foreign policy front, it became imperative that we reverse the impact of the apartheid regime's destabilisation policy in the Southern African region. This undertaking was set out in our Reconstruction and Development Policy which stated:

"in the long run, sustainable reconstruction in South Africa requires sustainable reconstruction and development in Southern Africa as a whole".

It is against this background that democratic South Africa's foreign policy is predicated on the spirit of good neighbourliness and compassion. We undertook to spare no energy in working towards regional stability and development through co-operation with our neighbours.

Ladies and gentlemen,

South Africa's Pan Africanist foreign policy orientation is not just based on the country's geographical location. It is firmly rooted in our African identity and values of Ubuntu (compassion). It is against this background that democratic South Africa prioritises the entrenchment of peace, security and enhanced socio-economic development of the region and the continent.

In the same vein, we are cognisant of our historical commonalities and continued solidarity with the global South, hence our commitment to build strong relations with countries such as the Dominican Republic. Our foreign policy approach seeks to build on these foundations to strengthen relations with countries of the South and other peace loving people of the world.

Our reconciliatory transition from apartheid to democracy enjoins us to advocate and actively pursue peaceful resolutions to international disputes. We have also committed ourselves to co-operatively work with countries of the North to advance our domestic priorities, the African agenda and the agenda of the global South.

All this could be effectively achieved within a global system which is responsive to our needs and aspirations. We have therefore continued to advocate together with the Dominican Republic and the entire global South for the reform of the global system of governance.

In short we work towards: "Creating a Better South Africa and Contributing to a Better and Safer Africa in a Better World".

I indulge you in this background so that you appreciate what our foreign policy outlook, principles and objectives are based on.

The evolution of South Africa's Foreign policy

After a lengthy international isolation, democratic South Africa had to make conscious decisions and choices in order to take its rightful position in Africa and the world at large. We had to consider balancing our immediate national priorities and the need to move from a pariah state to a responsible global citizen.

Whilst we were implementing our peaceful transformation agenda, the world was also changing. There was a global shift from a bi-polar to a uni-polar world dominated by the United States. Simply put, South Africa's foreign policy evolved within the context of a changing international environment.

Ladies and gentlemen

The ANC made an assessment of this situation and developed a document titled "Foreign Policy Perspective". The rapid changing international environment was summed up in the foreign policy perspective as follows:

"Our emergence as a democratic country in the decade of the 20th century has thrust us into a fundamentally transformed world".

In essence we took into cognisance the emergence of new political and economically influential powers such as China, India and Brazil, whilst acknowledging the inevitable re-emergence of Russia.

South Africa's foreign policy principles

I have demonstrated in part the complex nature of our foreign policy, which encompasses a combination of domestic policy priorities, strategies and objectives.

Allow me to briefly unpack principles upon which our foreign policy pillars rest:

Promotion and protection of human rights is the thrust of our foreign policy and these rights include political, economic, social and environmental rights;

Promotion of democracy is an important impetus to finding lasting solutions to the problems of humankind;

Justice and respect for international law should guide the conduct of international actors in the purview of international relations;

Peace is the goal for which all strive, and shall utilise internationally agreed and nonviolent mechanisms to pursue;

The African continent should be central to South Africa's foreign policy choices; and

Economic development should be pursued through regional and international economic cooperation in a just and interdependent world.

Having unpacked these inherent principles, I would like to reflect on some of the strategic pillars of our foreign policy.

Africa agenda

The centrality of Africa in our foreign policy is based on our commitment to work towards the realisation of a vision of a united, peaceful and prosperous Africa. This commitment is an expression of our Pan Africanist foreign policy orientation I referred to earlier. We pursue an African Agenda which is predicated on the plan to entrench democracy, peace and security in Africa, and acceleration of economic growth for the betterment of Africans.

We have continued to utilise our own experience of a peaceful transition to collaborate with fellow Africans in the pursuit of peace and stability on the continent. Some of the political processes we have facilitated include our contributions to peaceful settlements in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi, Southern Sudan, the Ivory Coast, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Lesotho.

The African Union (AU) can only realise its mandate of working towards Africa's political and economic integration agenda if it operates within a conducive environment. We are aware of the need to strengthen this continental body's structures for effective implementation of its decisions and mechanisms. However, it is imperative that the people of African descent in this region and the country in particular play an active role in Africa's development agenda. As you know, South Africa is committed to the promotion of an increased role of the African Diaspora in contributing towards peace, stability, democracy and sustainable growth and development in Africa.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The continent's economic blue print, which is the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) remains a frame of reference for our development cooperation. NEPAD does not only mean economic cooperation with the outside world but it is also there for us to partner among ourselves as Africans on the continent and the diaspora.

Within this context, we enter into partnerships to promote the NEPAD priority projects, particularly the bankable NEPAD projects which are implemented at various regions of the continent. These are deliberately anchored by Regional Economic Communities which are building blocks towards Africa's integration.

Multilateral relations

Since the dawn of democracy and our re-admission to the United Nations (UN) we have become vocal in advocating for the interests and aspirations of the African continent and the global South in the UN. We believe that an effective and collective global system of governance remains the only hope in addressing challenges we are all faced with in the world.

The continued marginalisation of developing countries, coupled with unilateral actions by global powers in pursuit of narrow national interests, has weakened the UN. The irony is that developing countries' peace and security issues dominate the agenda of the UN. It is therefore inconceivable that in 70 years of its existence the UN remains undemocratic and unrepresentative. We need a reformed system of global governance based on collective decision-making and implementation.

Ladies and gentlemen,

It is for this reason that during our non-permanent memberships of the UNSC we continued to work towards respect of the regional organization's intervention on issues affecting their regions. The commitment to provide African solutions to African problems is premised on our understanding of the inherent role of the AU as a regional organisation in pursuing the African agenda.

In the same vein, we are concerned about the reversal of gains registered in synergising the work of the AU Peace and Security Council and the UN Security Council (UNSC) to prevent and manage conflicts in Africa. We therefore believe that this is contrary to the provisions of Chapter VIII of the UN Charter on the relationship between the UN and regional organisations.

While addressing these pertinent issues, we must continue to work towards resolving some of the immediate challenges facing humanity such as climate change. We hope that a legal binding agreement will be reached in the upcoming Paris Climate Change Conference scheduled for December 2015.

South- South Relations

We actively participate in larger formations of the global South in collaboration with the Dominican Republic. In this regard, we utilise our membership of the Non Aligned Movement (NAM) to influence political decision making in other broader multilateral fora such as the UN. In the same vein our participation in the Group of 77+China is aimed at advancing the collective developmental aspirations of developing countries.

We are members of other formations comprising countries of the global South such as IBSA and BRICS. We participate in these formations to advance our national interests and the African agenda. At continental level, we are an active member of all AU Strategic Partnerships, such as the Forum for China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), the New Africa Asia Strategic Partnership (NAASP), amongst others.

North-South cooperation

South Africa's relations with countries of the north is predicated on our commitment to build mutual beneficial partnerships with a view to address the needs and aspirations of African people and the people of the global South. These relations take the form of both bilateral and multilateral engagements. It is our continued endeavour to leverage the opportunities presented by these relations in an effort to reduce the widening gap between the rich North and the developing South.

To complement our bilateral cooperation with countries of the North, we have prioritised further strengthening of the Strategic partnership with the European Union (EU). This strategic partnership creates a platform for us to promote Africa's socio-economic development agenda within the framework of NEPAD.

Economic Diplomacy

Our National Development Plan (NDP) vision 2030 calls for building of a resilient economy and enjoins us to address the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality. Economic diplomacy is therefore an important component of our foreign policy through which the NDP vision and trajectory can be realised.

South Africa's commitment to promote a fair and equitable world trade system is informed by our historical experiences and African identity. Our solidarity with the Dominical Republic enjoins us to work together and identify areas of economic cooperation which will benefit the citizens of our sister countries.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We are confident that our resolve to deepen existing bilateral economic relations and to explore more trade and investment opportunities will contribute towards increased Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Most importantly, this region and the Dominican Republic has experience in sectors of economy which we have only recently started exploring.

In this regard our resolve is to utilise Operation Phakisa which uses the Big Fast Results Methodology to achieve the NDP trajectory. This methodology enjoins us to unlock our oceans' economic potential, amongst others.

There are quite a number of thematic areas which I have discussed in brief. However I trust that we have presented a global view of South Africa's international relations engagements.

I thank you.

HD 	Nigeria Remains Committed to Building Value-Driven Partnerships With Countries of South - Buhari

Sep 28, 2015 (Leadership/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- President Muhammadu Buhari has said that Nigeria remains firmly committed to building value-driven partnerships with countries of the South.

The president stated this at a sideline event on Strengthening South-South Cooperation in the framework of the post-2015 Development Agenda at the ongoing 70th United Nations General Assembly in New York.

TD 
	

According to him, Nigeria values, and has supported South-South cooperation and will continue to do so, noting that it is the embodiment of the principles of solidarity and unity that define the common goals and aspirations of developing countries.

"It provides an important platform for developing countries to engage in mutually beneficial economic and technological cooperation."

The president, however, noted that the global political and economic reality suggested urgency for greater collaboration among the global South.

"Therefore, in strengthening South-South Partnerships to become the effective mechanism of change we envisage, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides the unique platform to find the adaptable development solutions among developing countries.

"The changing patterns of global development, driven largely by the remarkable turn-around of the leading economies of the South, underscore the importance of the South in shaping the world economic order.

"Countries of the South must increase their collaborative processes to share knowledge and understand the lessons from the socio-economic performance of key Southern economies," he said.

According to president Buhari, building strong partnerships require the political will and a conscious approach to the exchange of human, scientific and technical knowledge between developing countries.

"We must be innovative in strengthening South-South trade, promote the transfer of environmentally-sound technologies, and enhance the implementation of effective capacity-development mechanisms."

He stressed that the global South must not be complacent regarding the promotion of a universal, rules-based, open and equitable multilateral trading system, including through the conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda.

"As we seek to strengthen South-South cooperation we must not lose sight of the continued relevance of North-South cooperation.

"It should be noted that official development assistance must supplement greater flexibility and improvement in the terms of trade enjoyed by Southern economies.

"This will be a vital tool in the implementation of the Post-2015 development agenda.

"However, we would like to see this executed in a manner that does not create a dependency syndrome," he added.

President Buhari expressed the hope that a strengthened global South would enhance global macro-economic and political stability if greater policy cohesion and coordination was embraced by all.

He said that it would also open up the space for public-private partnerships and greater in-roads for the private sector.

"With the renewal of our common commitment, we can harness and leverage Southern partnerships for consolidation and growth."

He expressed optimism that "the South-South Cooperation will serve as an important building block for the collective development and strengthens the means of implementing the new Sustainable Development Agenda."

"We must also remember that profiles of Southern economies are fundamentally different from Northern industrial economies.

"Our focus, therefore, should be on quality technological education for development.

"In addition, employment for our teeming youths should, above all, be addressed to ensure social peace and general well-being of our countries," he concluded. (NAN)

HD 	Is South-South Cooperation Just a Catchphrase? [opinion]

Sep 16, 2015 (SciDev.Net/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The term global South is often used to lump together everything that is not a traditional industrialised country. But comprised as it is of the nations of Africa, Central and South America and parts of Asia, the global South is much more diverse in capacity and economic activity than the label implies - its emerging markets offer numerous opportunities for economic growth, investment and cultural contribution.

At the World Social Science Forum 2015 in Durban, South Africa, this week, the debate focused on how countries in the global South can join forces to become the facilitators of their own, collective growth. In other words, how can they be stronger together? According to Jurek Seifert, from the Institute of Development Research and Development Policy in Germany, South-South development cooperation is framed as help among equals and as being fundamentally different from the North-South approach.

TD 
	

"The main difference that's put forth is that cooperation is horizontal, and that what [global South countries] do is different, and comes from a different background than traditional donors," he told a panel.

But there are problems with this view. First of all, Seifert said, there is no recognised concept or framework for South-South cooperation. Essentially, all providers are doing what they want and calling it cooperation, without any strategic approach.

There are also doubts about how widespread horizontality is in South-South partnerships. Taking the example of Brazil as a development partner for other Latin American countries, Seifert said, "it is very difficult to assume there will be horizontal collaboration, as Brazil is a much more powerful and more developed player in the region".

These are indeed valid points. But my greatest concern came when the panel suggested that South-South development cooperation is a catchphrase that generates more public support than its results warrant. Panellists called it "rhetoric" and said it was of no relevance to building successful bilateral relationships between countries.

I wondered, does this undermine South-South cooperation? Or does it make it reminiscent of North-South cooperation?

At the conference, attendants agreed that global South countries struggle to develop their own cooperation practices, and some wondered how these would work with established practices of rich countries. The panel heard that individual countries can grapple with the idea of doing "something different" from the North.

So how to move forward? The conference, perhaps unsurprisingly, proposed more research. Seifert said that all countries in cooperative relationships - whether from the North or South - have one problem in common: they rarely monitor or evaluate their development work. Maybe the first step towards improving South-South cooperation is for researchers to change that.

Sep 08, 2015 (This Day/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- There have been times in Nigeria's history when the Judiciary stood strong and protected the principles of Democracy and the Rule of Law. Many countries in West Africa have looked up to Nigeria for the headship of their judiciaries. Nigeria has also faced the challenge of struggling for judicial independence. The great strides that Kenya has made in recent times in Judicial and constitutional transformation informed the choice of Dr. Willy Mutunga, Chief Justice and President of the Supreme Court of Kenya as Keynote Speaker at the Opening Ceremony of this Year's Annual General Conference of the Nigerian Bar Association, which was held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja recently. Dr. Willy Mutunga spoke pertinently, sharing his country's experience on how Kenya surmounted the similar challenges Nigeria now faces.

TD 
	

My address is organised in three parts with the first one offering a general commentary on claims pertaining to transformative constitutions and transformative constitutionalism. These claims seek to answer one of the burning questions of our time: Can Judiciaries contribute to the social transformation of countries in Africa? In the second part, I highlight key aims of Kenyan's experience with struggles for a transformative constitution and transformative constitutionalism with a focus on: a) The vision of Kenya's 2010 Constitution b) It's new Judiciary c) The Kenyan Constitution's role in generating a theory of its interpretation. And d) Efforts by the Judiciary to decolonise its jurisprudence under the dictates of a progressive and transformative constitution In the last part, I highlight pivotal aspects of the Judiciary Transformation Framework that seeks to demonstrate that there is a paradigm of Transformation from the Margins that works notwithstanding resistance from external and internal anti-transformation forces. Thereafter, I very briefly conclude my address

Transformation, Transformative Constitutions and Transformative Constitutionalism The Claim: Social transformation in any society is located within its global, continental, regional, and national contexts. Hobsbawm states, "Our world risks both explosion and implosion. It must change." Within the context of Africa and the Global South this "World" is one of domination, oppression, exploitation largely by Western contemporary capitalism, and by an elite in the South that is insular, selfish and unimaginative. Although in some parts of the Global South there are signs of gradual disengagement from world contemporary capitalism that is not the case for Africa and many states in the Global South. In the case of Africa the emergence of Afro-Chinese relations have heralded the debate on what these relations mean to Africa. I do not want to go into these debates but to state that I agree with Professor Kwesi Kwaa Prah who argues that the debate should not be whether the West or the East dominates, exploits, and oppresses Africa, but whether Africa can identify, articulate its material interests, and negotiate with the West and the East on that basis. That argument entails serious interrogation of the crises of political leadership in Africa. In other words, can Africa (judges, politicians, scholars) summon its 'confidence quotient' to comprehensively identify its interests and engage the rest of the world on these terms? In transforming judiciaries to contribute to social transformation those contexts are equally important. The role of law in social transformation, once the source of serious and continuous jurisprudential debates, has acquired a consensus that law, indeed, has a role to play in social transformation. This consensus is multi-disciplinary and is shared by lawyers, economists, political scientists and anthropologists.

The question whether law and the courts can advance, stagnate or impede social justice and social transformation has a long genealogy. Perhaps one of the most trenchant critiques of the role of courts in producing social change is American Professor Gerald Rosenberg's book "Hollow Hope: Can Courts Bring about Social Change?" in which he stridently argues:

"Courts can almost never be effective producers of significant social reform. At best, they can second the social reform acts of the other branches of government... .. At worst, courts serve as 'fly paper' for social reformers who succumb to the 'lure of litigation'... .. Court rulings divert scarce resources away from more productive uses while providing only an 'illusion of change."

However, what is now generally acknowledged from this debate is that law has profoundly distributive effects and it cannot be ignored as a tool for social justice. Clearly, 'Hollow Hope' makes a pertinently hollow claim for litigation on social and economic rights or land or public finance have such far reaching developmental implications that evidences the place of the law as a change agent. In the coming into effect of the new phenomenon of Transformative Constitutionalism, this debate has been both enriched and transformed (pun intended). The very idea of a transformative constitution (like those of India, Colombia, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, South Africa, and Kenya) is the idea that the Constitutional superstructure is embedded on a theory that the Constitution will be an instrument for the transformation of society rather than a historical, economic and socio-political pact to preserve the status quo as the earlier constitutions did. Fundamentally important to transformative constitutionalism are values of the rule of law, human rights, and social democratic sustainable development.

The claim, therefore, is that transformative constitutions and transformative constitutionalism are both engines of social transformation. A transformative Constitution and its attendant transformative constitutionalism are both about change from a status quo that is neither acceptable nor sustainable. Transformative constitutions are not revolutionary but could be the basis or fundamental revolutionary change in a society. Transformative constitutionalism is anchored to progressive jurisprudence from the Judiciary and observance of the Constitution by other State Organs, and all people. It is a jurisprudence that allows us, as Africa, also to be producers, developers and shapers of international law. It is part of that 'Africa confidence quotient' needed in our relations with the rest of the world. At the economic, social, cultural and political levels transformative constitutions and constitutionalism aim at social change that can put any nation in a social democratic trajectory and a consequent basis for democratic sustainable development. Testing these theoretical and practical claims requires an in-depth study of particularly the many jurisdictions I have mentioned that claim to have transformative constitutions and attendant transformative constitutionalism. While the jurisprudence in these jurisdictions continue to enrich Kenya's jurisprudence I cannot in this Address discuss the various limitations that have been the subject of various studies by scholars. I will, however, touch on some of these when I discuss our experience:

The Kenyan Experience The Vision of the 2010 Constitution Kenya's constitution is not a child of fear resulting from the ethnic violence of 2007/2008. It is a product of 40 years of struggle of ambition and aspiration whose frustrations by the Kenyan elite culminated in the violence. It is the reason Kenyans ignored both the political and religious elite to pass a constitution that embodies their aspirations as a people.

In their wisdom the Kenyan people saw the old constitution as legitimising an unacceptable and unsustainable status quo. They thus reconfigured and reconstructed the state from its former vertical, imperial, authoritative, non-accountable content under the former Constitution to a state that is accountable, horizontal, decentralised, democratised, and responsive to the vision of the Constitution; a vision of nationhood premised on national unity and political integration, while respecting diversity; provisions on the democratisation and decentralisation of the Executive; devolution; decreeing values in the public service; giving ultimate authority to the people of Kenya that they delegate to institutions that must serve them and not enslave them; prioritising integrity in public leadership; a modern Bill of Rights that provides for economic, social and cultural rights to reinforce the political and civil rights giving the whole gamut of human rights the power to radically mitigate the status quo and signal the creation of a human rights state and society in Kenya; mitigating the status quo in the land sector that has been the country's Achilles heel in its economic and democratic development; the strengthening of institutions; the creation of institutions that provide democratic checks and balances among others. In one of its transformative pronouncements the Kenyan constitution provides that judicial authority, just like executive and legislative authority, is derived from the people. The Kenyan people chose the route of transformation and not revolution to end their poverty and deprivation and regain their dignity and sovereigntyIt can be argued that the 2010 Constitution reflects the vision of those patriots who struggled and fought against our domination, exploitation, and oppression by British colonialism and post-colonial political and economic elites. History records invocation of discourses of reform, revolution, human rights, social justice, patriotism, freedom, nationhood, among others that the 2010 Constitution decrees.

The New Judiciary The Kenyan distinguished professor and constitutional law scholar, Professor Yash Pal Ghai, has argued that: "Perhaps realising its own ambitious project, and hence its vulnerability and fragility, the Kenyan Constitution sets, through the judiciary, its barricades against destruction of its values and weakening of its institutions by forces external to itself. Such is the responsibility of Kenya's judiciary." It is perhaps remarkable, and indeed, a paradox that, although disappointment with the judiciary was at least as great among the common Kenyan as frustration with politicians, it is also true that they chose to place their faith in the institution of the new judiciary in implementing the new Constitution.

They did this by promulgating a Constitution that provides for the appointing of women and men of integrity by an independent and broadly representative Judicial Service Commission; by providing for institutional and decisional independence of the Judiciary and the judicial officers respectively;) through the vetting of judges and magistrates who served before August 27, 2010 by a Board which had a broad criteria upon which to determine the suitability of these judicial officers; by setting up the Judiciary Fund to signal financial independence of the Judiciary; and finally by creating a new apex court, the Supreme Court that would act as the final protector and custodian of the supremacy of the Constitution. By vetting the old judicial officers and by recruiting new judicial officers in a transparent and competitive manner that called for public participation, the new Constitution created a new Judiciary. The interview for the recruitment of judges, including the chief Justice, is carried out in the open, in the full glare of the media. The Constitution required that the Kenyan Judiciary should transform itself first so that it could be imbued with the ethos of the transformative constitution to lead the change and be the true engine of societal transformation. The old judiciary was the first victim of the new constitutional order. The Chief Justice was forced to resign after six months of its promulgation. This gave the judiciary the moral momentum to lead the transformation of the judiciary and society. The judiciary became the only source of oxygen for this new constitutional order. Let me add here that the old judiciary operated under very difficult circumstances, as indeed, all judiciaries in Africa do, but the Kenyan people wanted to create under the new constitution a new judiciary. A transformative constitution required a transformed judiciary to generate the requisite transformative jurisprudence. This is what we have been doing in Kenya and the progress is encouraging, difficulties and challenges notwithstanding.

Mainstreaming the Theory of Interpreting the 2010 Constitution The Kenya Constitution is also unusual in setting out a theory of interpretation. In the same vein the Kenyan Parliament, in enacting the Supreme Court Act 2011, (Supreme Court Act) has in the provisions of Section 3 of that Act reinforced this aspect of constitutional pre-occupation in its theory of interpretation. The relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Supreme Court Act, 2011 respectively are: 259. (1) This Constitution shall be interpreted in a manner that- (a) promotes its purposes, values and principles; (b) advances the rule of law, and the human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Bill of Rights; (c) permits development of the law; and (d) contributes to good governance. (3) Every provision of this Constitution shall be construed according to the doctrine of interpretation that the law is always speaking... Section 3 of the Supreme Court Act provides: 3. The object of this Act is to make further provisions with respect to the operation of the Supreme Court as a court of final authority to, among other things- c. develop rich jurisprudence that respects Kenya's history and traditions and facilitates its social, economic and political growth; d. enable important constitutional and legal matters, including matters relating to the transition from the former to the present constitutional dispensation, to be determined having due regard to the circumstances, history and cultures of the people of Kenya. In a recent judgment delivered on September 29, 2014 The CCK Petition 14 as Consolidated with Petitions 14A, 14B and 14C the Supreme Court revisited this critical issue of the theory of the interpretation of the 2010 Constitution. [356] We revisit once again the critical theory of constitutional-interpretation and relate it to the emerging human rights jurisprudence based on Chapter Four - The Bill of Rights - of our Constitution. The fundamental right in question in this case is the freedom and the independence of the media. We have taken this opportunity to illustrate how historical, economic, social, cultural, and political content is fundamentally critical in discerning the various provisions of the Constitution that pronounce on its theory of interpretation. "[232]... References to Black's Law Dictionary will not, therefore, always be enough, and references to foreign cases will have to take into account these peculiar Kenyan needs and contexts. What is this interpretative theory? I believe it is a theory that shuns staunch positivism; that accepts judges make law; that by invoking non-legal phenomena in its interpretation it establishes the judiciary "as an institutional political actor; a theory that is a merger of paradigms and that problematises, interrogates, and historicises all paradigms in building a radical democratic content that is transformative of the state and society; it a theory that values a multi-disciplinary approach to the implementation of the Constitution; its neither insular nor inward looking and seeks its place in global comparative jurisprudence and seeks equality of participation, development, and influence. Thus, this theory of interpretation of the Constitution will also undergird various streams and strands of our jurisprudence that reflect the holistic interpretation of the Constitution.

The Decolonising Jurisprudence The true hinge of the Transformative Constitution to social transformation lies in the jurisprudence and judicial practice that the courts generate in their everyday work. This theory of interpreting the 2010 Constitution has given birth to the decolonising jurisprudence of social justice. I want to emphasise here our commitment to the need to develop new, not only highly competent but also indigenous jurisprudence. I link this last adjective to the Constitution's value of patriotism. I conceive that it requires the judge to develop the law in a way that responds to the needs of the people, and to the national interest as constitutionally codified. I call this robust (rich), patriotic, indigenous, and patriotic jurisprudence as decreed by the Constitution and also by the Supreme Court Act of Kenya.Above all, it requires a commitment to the Constitution and to the achievement of its values and vision. The decolonising jurisprudence of social justice does not mean being insular and inward looking. The values of the Kenyan Constitution are anything but. We can and should learn from other countries. My concern, when I emphasise "indigenous" is simply that we should grow our jurisprudence out of our own needs, without unthinking deference to that of other jurisdictions and courts, however, distinguished. And, indeed, the quality of our progressive jurisprudence would command respect in these distinguished jurisdictions. After all the Kenyan constitution is one of the most progressive in the world.

While developing and growing our jurisprudence Commonwealth and international jurisprudence will continue to be pivotal, the Judiciary will have to avoid mechanistic approaches to precedent. It will not be appropriate to reach out and pick a precedent from India one day, Australia another, South Africa another, the US another, just because they seem to suit the immediate purpose. Each of those precedents will have its place in the jurisprudence of its own country. A negative side of a mechanistic approach to precedent is that it tends to produce a mind-set: "If we have not done it before, why should we do it now?" The Constitution does not countenance that approach.

The Constitution took a bold step and provides that "The general rules of international law shall form part of the law of Kenya" and "Any treaty or convention ratified by Kenya shall form part of the law of Kenya under this Constitution". We have become as noted earlier not only the users of international law, but also its developers and shapers. Our jurisprudence must seek to reinforce those strengths in foreign jurisprudence that fit our needs while at the same time rescuing the weaknesses of such jurisprudence so that ours is ultimately enriched as decreed by the Supreme Court Act.

The Judiciary Transformation Framework (JTF), 2012-2016 The JTF is our blueprint for laying a strong foundation for a transformed judiciary. The framework has four pillars: access to justice, infrastructure, transformative leadership, and using technology as an enabler for justice. We dusted off many reports that had recommended radical reforms in the Judiciary, but the absence of political will made their implementation impossible. We simply told everybody in the Judiciary that we were going to implement reforms they themselves had agreed upon only that we had to take into account the new Constitution. This was a great strategy to nip internal resistance to the JTF in the bud.

Knowing there was no political will internally and externally to transform the judiciary we cautiously started from the margins. We focused on the judicial culture that the public found repellent. The Judiciary Cultural Revolution hence begun.

Long regarded as distant, arrogant, bewigged and bewildering, the deliberate attempt to humanise the judiciary won much public acclaim and support. We debated and agreed that judges of the superior courts would not wear wigs; that all judicial officers, from the Magistrates to the Supreme Court would be addressed as "your honor" that stopping judges from playing God; deconstructing why we are called "justices" when we commit injustices to the people; creating a pledge from judicial officers and staff that humanised our administration of justice. The judiciary cultural revolution also included re-orienting the institution as a service not lording institution. It included simple messages to the public to demand better services from us coupled with basic re-training and re-immersion for our officers to learn the basics of public service. It included, for example, the innovation of the SIX PLEDGES displayed on all our court stations and which all Judicial Officers were required to adhere to. The first two of which, human as it is, were remarkable in its absence in the "old" Judiciary: They read:

- We pledge to cordially greet you and welcome you to our courts. - We pledge to treat you with courtesy, dignity, and respect. We made the Judiciary a service institution, a Judiciary for all Kenyans. We established a public complaints mechanism - the Office of the Judiciary Ombudsperson, located in the Office of the chief Justice. We allowed internal equity of voice and horizontalised the institution through a process of inclusion. (For those who are not Africans, it is difficult to understand why this is an important transformative practice. Suffice to say that, drinking tea is deeply embedded in Africa and Kenya; but access to this socio-cultural good was underpinned by power dynamics in the judiciary. In Kenya chai (tea) also means a bribe. So our slogan became the judiciary must give tea (justice) to Kenyans and never take it!). At any rate, with the ushering of our cultural revolution in the judiciary, drinking tea was democratised and all staff in the Judiciary in all court stations were henceforth entitled to tea; something that was bizarrely a preserve of the heads of stations and their secretaries! The internal resistance to this policy remains one of the most bewildering aspects of our transformation. We kept telling judicial officers and staff that if they could not give justice to their colleagues how could they convince other Kenyans that they would get justice. We also started monthly tea sessions at the Supreme Court, sessions that were attended by the CJ, staff and judges. There was an important lesson here: by giving the rank-and-file within the institution a voice and dignity to speak up and participate in the governance of the institution, we were also locking them into the transformation ideology; giving them a stake; and insuring against backsliding by their seniors. By delivering our colleagues from administrative tyranny; whimsical transfers across court stations in the country; stagnated promotions and sexually-transmitted promotions (STPs), we gave them a reason to believe in an institution that could stand for their rights and justice; and they reciprocated by serving the citizen better; and finding innovative solutions to their local problems.

We revived the Judiciary Training Institute (JTI) to become our institution of higher learning, the nerve centre of our progressive jurisprudence. JTI co-ordinates our academic networks, our networks with progressive jurisdictions, our training by scholars and judges, starting with our own great scholars and judges.

As we have sought to rid the judiciary of corruption we have encountered the resistance of corrupt cartels inside and outside the Judiciary, including the bar. The struggle to make the Judiciary a beacon for anti-corruption struggles in the country continues. We have established internal structures in the Judiciary to undertake our own investigations. After relative successes owing to recruitment, better terms to judicial officers and staff, rigorous disciplinary procedures by the JSC, vetting of judicial officers, we are now undertaking forensic lifestyle audits that will begin at the Supreme Court, and indeed, with the Chief Justice. We are guided by the wisdom of the Nigerian proverb from the Igbo that "A bad habit that lasts more than a year may turn into a custom." We also sought support from the donors to create capacities in the new offices in the Judiciary set up under the Constitution. In 2011 the OCJ had two secretaries and eight bodyguards. Through the help of donors the capacity of the OCJ includes Chief of Staff, Communications expert, Legal Counsel, and the Office of the Judiciary Ombudsperson.

It worth noting that some judicial reforms have become irreversible, irrevocable, indestructible, and permanent. Historically, the judiciary has been predominantly male-dominated. By 1993, when Kenya Women Judges Association (KMJA) was inaugurated, there were only three women judges. Over the years, there has been a rise in the number of female judges in the Judiciary. At the magistracy level, for instance, there is almost gender balance with 47% representation of female magistrates or 215 out of the 458 magistrates. Out of the 69 High Court judges, 29 are Lady Justices. At the Court of Appeal, 8 of the total 26 Appellate Judges are female while at the Supreme Court, there are 2 female Justices in the 7 member bench. The message here is thanks to the 2010 Constitution the implementation of gender equity in the Judiciary is irreversible.

These reforms include promoting colleagues on merit and in a transparent and accountable manner; equalising salary disparities to reflect the values of equity and equality; making training and travel fair and just; having in place transfer policies that are fair and just and that are authored by the staff; making access to insurance for all; car and house mortgages accessible to all; the pivotal position of JTI is guaranteed; the existence of Judges and Magistrate's Association and Judicial Staff Association that participate in the governance of the Judiciary; ensuring that the administrative arm of the judiciary facilitates the judicial arm that ensures the core business of administering justice is not jeopardised; democratising governance in the judiciary as decreed by the constitution; the emergence and development of progressive jurisprudence is on course; the project of "judgment as a dialogue" where judicial officers in their judgment seek to convince the loser that they had justice is now acceptable; and creating a vibrant judicial and public constituency that will make sure that these reforms are permanent.

Despite resistance from judicial officers and staff, the Office of the Judiciary Ombudsperson that receives and acts on complaints against judicial officers and staff has become a critical institution, this is now irreversible. It has restored public confidence in the Judiciary, as have Court Users Committees (CUCs) that are cradles of public participation in judicial affairs and judicial accountability. CUCs are grassroots structures reflected at the centre by the National Council for the Administration of Justice (NCAJ). The NCAJ is established under the Judicial Service Act. NCAJ and CUCs are the centres of inter-agency dialogue, collaboration, coordination, and interaction. They reflect the vision of the Constitution that decrees robust independence of institutions, but calls for dialogue and inter-dependence for the public interest and good to nurture nationhood in Kenya.

The Judiciary has been a leader in the promotion of dialogue, interdependence, and collaboration as decreed by the Constitution. Although the three arms of the state are robustly independent under the Constitution, the Constitution decrees dialogue among them in the national interest. These dialogues have taken place through the Judiciary Training Institute workshops between the Judiciary and security agencies, Parliament, constitutional Commissions, and other state organs. The NCAJ is a vehicle for such dialogue. Tripartite dialogues between the President, the Speakers, and the Chief Justice have taken place on ad hoc basis should be institutionalised. In these meetings the Judiciary has been able to clarify to the other arms what it does, can do, and cannot do. It has sought to clarify the mandates of the three arms, the sovereignty of the people, checks and balances, and the supremacy of the Constitution. Through such dialogues mental shifts in favor of the implementation of the Constitution are taking place notwithstanding the resistance.

We have used scientific data in aid of the constitutional principle of accountability. Article 10 of the Constitution requires all State Organs, of which the Judiciary is one, to apply the national values and principles of governance enumerated thereunder, in the execution of their mandates. Article 10 (2) (c) in particular identifies 'good governance, integrity, transparency and accountability' as part of the body of these principles of governance.

Partly in furtherance of these constitutional provisions the Judicial Service Act 5(2) (b) provided that, every year, the Chief Justice is required to prepare the State of the Judiciary and the Administration of Justice Report (SOJAR), present the report to the public; present it to the National Assembly, and to the Senate for debate and approval; and to have the report gazetted.

Even though the accountability requirements of this statutory provision are clear, the methodology remains a work in progress. There was the necessity and utility from the inception of measuring performance. That is why the Performance Management Directorate was set up as a fully-fledged directorate. Its positive impact on the transformation program, especially on data gathering perspective, has been remarkable. The process of preparing the first two State of Judiciary Reports revealed the centrality of data as a key driver of transformation. The empirical data and evidence served to illuminate performance, or the lack thereof, and provided a scientific basis for the allocation of resources and policy decisions - decisions previously made on the basis of 'felt-needs', mere observation, or past practice. In its assessment of the outputs of courts, judges, magistrates, and other judicial staff it has engendered internal and external accountability. The internal leadership of the Judiciary is now more accountable in administrative decisions that are expected to be evidence-based. Data has emerged as the king of transformation.

Deepening the culture of data gathering and performance reporting institutionalises accountability, induces performance through competitive and comparative tendencies, and secures transformation permanently. To entrench accountability practices as part of transformation, an expansive view of the provisions of the Judicial Service Act is necessary to entrench accountability as part of transformation.

On the promotion of access to Justice under the first pillar of our (JTF) we have decentralised the Court of Appeal into three regions (circuits) of Mombasa, Kisumu and Malindi; established Judicial Service Week for Criminal Appeals where we dedicate specific weeks for specific judges in a year to hear all criminal appeals in order to clear case back logs, decongest our prison system and in the end ensure that justice is seen to be done to those languishing in prison for at times illegal convictions; and Public Hearings and Live media coverage on matters of Public Interest to comply with the constitutional value of public participation in the administration of justice. We also acknowledge that only 5% of Kenyans access our formal courts and in compliance with Article 159 of the Constitution we are promoting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms including court annexed mediation, and above all traditional justice systems. Access to justice is about the citizens accessing justice in forums they are convinced they will get justice. We are also working on pilot schemes on how to link the formal justice system to these other forums used by citizens to access justice.

The Kenyan case confirms that the implementation of devolution of political power and resources is ushering in the politics of issues, the central one being the equitable distribution of resources. Kenyans are seeking greater participation in how the resources received in counties are spent by the Governors and the Members of the County Assemblies. They want to be involved in the prioritisation of projects and public participation at the grassroots is growing. At this level the vision of the constitution that all political and public power is derived from the people of Kenya, and thus the very first attempt to bring the state and its apparatuses under the sovereignty of the people is being made. This great movement of the people is challenged by the crisis of political leadership that focuses on the politics of divide and rule invoking ethnic, religious, regional, class, generational, gender, clan, and racial divisions to keep the political elite in power. What is worse is the lack of a visible organised alternative political leadership. The middle class civil society leadership still debates the principle of non-partisanship when their grassroots compatriots are debating the formation of political parties that will be anchored on transformative social movements. So, there is a great movement developing at the grassroots because of the resources that are being directed there, but the absence of an alternative political leadership allows the political elites take political advantage of them. There is still a great opportunity in Kenya for an alternative political leadership to contest political power on a manifesto based on the vision of the transformative constitution. A humanised state that has a social democratic content is possible. The devolution of political power expands the sovereignty of the people that can be a basis of the deepening our transformation.

Conclusion Finally, as we envision progressive African jurisprudence based on our transformative constitutions, what is also called the gospel according to the Africans, we must concede that the project of social transformation is fundamentally a political project. In countries where the transformation of the judiciary has irreversible support from the political elites much progress can be quickly made. Where public participation in the politics of the society is robust and unified that could be a great ally to all institutions and to social transformation. We should, therefore, interrogate the limitations that face the various judiciaries.

Transformation as the Kenyan case study shows is at two levels, the theoretical or visionary level and at the level of implementation. At the theoretical level the vision of the constitution is clear as a manifesto for change and social progress. At the implementation level ideological and political struggles abound. The Kenyan Judiciary's experience of reforms from the margins to the centre is useful. It is testimony that reforms can actually take place in regimes that are anti-reform if the leadership of an institution is ready to struggle for them. It does not matter that positive outcomes are not readily discernible. The idea is to get the sovereignty of the people, that is, their material interests reflected in the reforms and they will provide the necessary support.

Political will, enabling constitution, credible and interested leadership and membership within the judiciary are primary conditions for rapid transformation of Africa's judiciaries. However, the absence of this bouquet of factors should not make Africa's judiciaries surrender and seek to conform to the status quo. Historically, it has always fallen to some institution to lead the process of change and transformation, even in the most difficult of circumstances. The church, trade union movements, peasant organisations, civil society groups have at various times in different societies been the agent of transformation. The second generation of constitutions in Africa not only provides the dynamic legal tools, but also places considerable responsibility on the judiciary to help engender societal transformation. The transformation of the judiciary in Africa is an objective and standard need and I do not know of any African country, however dictatorial, where judges do not enjoy security of tenure. Realising Africa's current pressing agenda of development, peace and security, and institution building can only be achieved through the Rule of law. The narrative of Africa rising will only last if we build and fortify our constitutional democracies characterised by, among other things, judiciaries that are independent and that possess integrity. That is the legacy that our judicial and political leaders in Africa must aspire to create - a vision which recognises the need for democratic and social transformation and the rule of law as the permanent and indestructible foundations of the future of Africa as a prosperous, equitable, peaceful, inclusive and secure civilisation that can lead the rest of the world.

Sep 03, 2015 (Institute of Development Studies/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- If everything you knew about volunteering and development came from recent press and media, you would think that the most significant group of people to focus on were 'gap year' participants from the UK, Europe, North America or Australia. Indeed, even most academic research is focused on individual volunteers from the global North as they go off to volunteer in the global South, taking with them a recently found interest in their 'host' countries.

This has meant that the activities of other volunteers working in development - such as global South nationals volunteering in their own countries, who make up by far the largest number - have been eclipsed by a focus which reflects traditional conceptions of aid, popular imaginaries of charity and development (as above), and histories of colonialism and mission.

TD 
	

So, despite their frequent association, we don't have a very good understanding of the relationship between volunteering and development, how the former can contribute to the latter or, for that matter, vice versa.

New research challenging old perceptions

There is a growing body of research on volunteering and development that goes beyond these preoccupations. This includes:

Valuing Volunteering, a joint project between IDS and Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO)

the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies' Global Review of Volunteering

research on Community Health volunteers

and, volunteering in particular settings such as the Volunteering in Complex Emergencies (PDF) project, just launched by the Swedish Red Cross.

Research on international volunteering is also looking beyond the 'gap year'.

In our work together, Nina Laurie and I have explored how volunteering and development ideas interweave over time, the role of diaspora volunteers through a collaborative PhD with VSO, and faith, volunteering and development, and are now working on medical volunteering through North to South and South to North exchanges.

As important as the range of topics and approaches, is an opening up of who produces research and knowledge and how, with key volunteering actors developing high quality work to support their own and the sector's activities.

Valuing Volunteering breaks ground in its content and methodology as well as in its partnership between IDS and VSO. Engaging over 3,700 volunteers across different countries and contexts, it asked volunteers and the communities they are working alongside how and why they thought volunteering contributed to change in their community and the factors that prevent it from doing so.

The IFRC Global Review of Volunteering, which I am working on with colleagues in Geneva, is another global development actor/academic partnership. It also breaks new ground by exploring volunteering across the global South and North, identifying shared challenges presented by issues such as increased global migration, forced displacements, and economic crises.

The changing geopolitics of development and its impact on volunteering

How volunteering is shaping and being shaped by the changing geopolitics of aid and development and rise of new aid donors provides a critical site for research.

South-South volunteering is not a new phenomenon - there are long histories of solidarities through volunteering between countries in the global South. But the interviews I have recently completed with individuals from China and the Philippines who have volunteered in Bangladesh, Kenya and Nepal, reveal dynamics, connections and hierarchies that have been largely ignored in volunteering research to date, but which speak directly to new debates around who is doing development, where and with whom.

As volunteering thinking and practice becomes widely accepted and globalized, often shaped by the volunteering ideas and experiences of the global North, there is an urgent need for more serious attention to the multiple ways volunteering is defined in and between settings.

Universal approaches can ease processes of measurement and policy mainstreaming, locating volunteering more firmly at the heart of contemporary practices of governance and development. But there is a risk that we lose sight of the specific ways volunteering happens in particular places, and that certain definitions and understandings dominate. It may also encourage new accountabilities and monitoring that reduce volunteering to only those activities that can be measured and restrict or disregard volunteering that falls outside of these activities.

Volunteering and development research in the future

The Global Review identifies the ways in which volunteers continue to be seen in some settings as a source of cheap labour to support aid and development service delivery. A central issue in this that we are exploring- resonating with Valuing Volunteering - has been the ways aid funded remuneration can create new volunteering economies and hierarchies that undermine sustained and inclusive volunteering in global South settings. Research is needed on who can volunteer, where and how, particularly given persistent inequalities within and between countries.

Valuing Volunteering marks an important step change in volunteering and development research. It not only provides crucial evidence of how and where volunteering has a distinct role to play in building the human and social capital that can lead to sustainable change, but also raises many questions to be explored through future research and practice.

To keep up the momentum will demand further innovation, collaborations and a commitment to addressing the silences and absences that have so far characterized research and public debate on the role of volunteers in development.

Matt Baillie Smith is Professor of International Development in the Department of Social Sciences and Languages and Director of the Centre for International Development at Northumbria University.

This is the fifth in a series of blogs relating to the Valuing Volunteering project. An IDS Bulletin on this theme is due out on 7th September.

Aug 12, 2015 (Institute of Development Studies/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Back in 2012, whilst recovering from an eye injury incurred when volunteering, I met Simon Lewis who was the lead researcher for Valuing Volunteering Kenya. This research captured my attention with its unique approach: participatory systemic action research.

In Korogocho, where I volunteered to co-ordinate a team of community researchers working with Simon, it gave us an opportunity to work with local people to think critically about development opportunities and challenges. It looked at community needs, engaging community members in determining the best intervention rather than starting initiatives and measuring the impacts later. It also moved us away from an approach where the volunteer is seen as an 'expert', to one of empowering locals to make informed decisions in development.

TD 
	

Volunteer organizations may want to learn more from this research so as to find a balance between the bottom-up and the 'golden' top-down approach. A balance relevant to a particular community need may auger well in terms of project implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

A Southern focus - the need for more research

I applaud the Valuing Volunteering research on its focus on the global South covering Kenya, Mozambique, Nepal and the Philippines. I feel strongly that more research is needed, not only to seek the views of local people, but to help bring out their potential. Enabling communities to realize the real value of volunteering can bring hope and renewed strength. They become more responsive to change. I noticed this in the people of Korogocho.

In the global South, selective research projects run the risk of being seen as rubber-stamps for sophisticated interventions thought up by the global North. The South needs robust and involving research projects like the Valuing Volunteering research to enrich development interventions. In efforts to enhance coordination, promotion and mainstreaming of volunteerism, many countries in the South are developing policies and laws. It would be better if the development of these laws and policies were guided by the findings of in-depth research. Some of these, for example, the proposed Kenya Volunteerism Policy, provide good opportunities for a deeper understanding of volunteerism through research.

Does the absence of adequate and specific research on volunteerism in the global South make it difficult for communities to undertake relevant volunteering for developmental interventions? If this is the case, then how can organizations and institutions, well-endowed with capacities to commission all-encompassing research, be of help in deepening volunteering for development in the South?

Providing legal frameworks

Kenya's process of developing the National Volunteerism Policy took place almost at the same time as the Valuing Volunteering research. Our research team interacted with several volunteer involving organizations and the consultants who were involved in the process. Our concern then was about the volunteering space and impacts.

In June, I attended The 4th IAVE Africa Regional Volunteer Conference, in Kigali, Rwanda, to speak about National Volunteer Networks - the Kenya case. I also took part in Volunteer Measuring for Global Impact II in Nairobi, Kenya. This was organized by United Nations Volunteers and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

During these two great discourses, discussion emerged around the importance and possible bottlenecks of having legal frameworks to support and coordinate volunteering. It was also reported that a number of countries in Africa are working on either policies and/or laws in this area. Personally, this is good news. When I injured my eye I tried to find out if I, or other volunteers in a similar predicament, had protection. There was none expressly given by our laws. Therefore, some sort of clear guiding principles to protect the rights of volunteers, volunteer involving organizations and governments are necessary.

Of great concern though is the feeling that these laws tend to recognize formal volunteering more than informal volunteering. In the best interest of volunteerism, can we ensure that some forms of volunteering are always kept informal or better still co-opted? How can we best engage with governments to ensure that laws do not compromise volunteerism?

Measuring volunteer impact and influencing the SDGs

Measuring volunteer impact is very important. Its documentation may help to inform, for example, the design of volunteer initiatives. In Korogocho, we attempted to underline the impacts from both formal and informal volunteering. It was intriguing to draw a comparison. The impacts resulting from informal volunteering out-did those that occurred due to formal volunteering. The challenge we now face is how to best document impacts that result from informal volunteering.

The world awaits the adoption of the SDGs in September. We need to appreciate efforts by volunteers and volunteer organizations in development who advocated to include volunteerism as a stand-alone SDG goal distinguished from civil society. Whilst we didn't achieve this, we do have room to ensure volunteerism features prominently as a real indicator in the SDGs implementation strategies. It will be interesting to see how volunteering could provide complementarity to the speedy and steady realization of the SDGs.

The need for wider partnerships in research

I have recently read two in-depth reports: The Role of Volunteering in Sustainable Development, VSO International and Institute of Development Studies, 2014, and the 2015 State of the World Volunteerism Report, United Nations Volunteers Programme, 2015. The UN 2015 State of the World's Volunteerism Report highlights five policy threads, which touches on participation, a level playing field, an enabling environment, partnerships and research. The report of the research on The Role of Volunteering in Sustainable Development demonstrates that volunteering contributes to sustainable development through inclusion, innovation, ownership, participation and inspiration.

In my view, the findings of the two reports speak to each other, and there are similarities which give great credibility to volunteerism. A means needs to be found to make these important findings accessible - in an easier to understand format - to millions of volunteers around the globe. This goal is just as important as reaching volunteer involving organizations and governments.

There is a need to actualize the findings of the two reports. But, which path will lead us into action? Which are the best action-result based strategies? How can resources be mobilized to action some of the findings? And where is the role of volunteers in terms of implementation? There are many questions still to be answered.

Looking to the future, I think that joint research efforts and enhancing synergy will help to avoid duplication, allow room for complementarity and maximize on resource utilization for real impacts.

Finally, in my opinion, research, other development strategies and particularly volunteering, must always ensure that its intended and eventual impacts are felt and realized at the grassroots. This is where it matters most. The moment communities, especially from the global South, are able to live in peace, are food secure, safe from preventable diseases, safe from abject poverty and are able to participate in inclusive governance and meaningful community development processes - it is only then that development can have a true meaning.

HD 	It's Time to Redraw the World's Very Unequal Knowledge Map [analysis]

Jul 11, 2015 (The Conversation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- If the world were mapped according to how many scientific research papers each country produced, it would take on a rather bizarre, uneven appearance. The Northern hemisphere would balloon beyond recognition. The global south, including Africa, would effectively melt off the map.

This image makes a dramatic point about the complexities of global inequalities in knowledge production and exchange. So what is driving this inequality and how can it be corrected?

TD 
	

Money matters

Money and technology are needed to produce research. The average research and development intensity - that is, as a percentage of GDP - was 2.4% for OECD countries in 2009. But few developing countries had reached 1%. Without sufficient national funds, researchers must spend a great deal of time fundraising and dealing with grant organisations outside their universities. This means less time for actually undertaking and producing research.

When it comes to technology, substantial bandwidth powers the global north and connects it to its neighbours. The internet is far slower and more expensive in Africa, making collaboration between researchers on the continent difficult and making it tougher for them than those in the US, Europe and Asia.

These technical, financial and even mechanical issues are easy to identify. It is tempting to put one's faith in the idea that more money and machines will solve the problems of knowledge production inequality. But it's not that simple.

A double bind

Values and practices contribute just as much to global imbalances as material disparities do. The science journals that publish the research which populates our strange map aren't neutral: engagement with them is characterised by several levels of uneven participation.

A study of four high impact journals in the management social sciences found that they attracted authors from many countries worldwide but their empirical sites of investigation were significantly located in Europe and North America. This suggests that local researchers will use their scarce financial and technical resources to get published in high impact, supposedly international journals.

Given the overall constrained research environments in which researchers operate, these resources are lost to local research needs and may in effect subsidise the research of the global north. At the same time, relatively well-resourced researchers from the global north undertake research in developing countries and publish in those same journals.

In the worst cases, the global south simply provides novel empirical sites and local academics may not become equal partners in these projects about their own contexts.

Researchers in the global south are caught in a double bind. They are rewarded for publishing in "international" journals in several ways: through promotions and often even financially. But development imperatives, government policies and their own interests pressurise them to undertake research that is relevant to pressing social and related problems which may not be appealing or even "academic" enough to interest the international journals.

'Invisible research'

There is another problem with this journals map: it measures science journal articles as the sole representation of scientific research output. It ignores things like monographs and edited collections and interprets "science" narrowly - excluding social sciences and humanities' genres.

In many contexts valid research is undertaken and published with the unfortunate name of "grey literature". This includes working papers, technical and policy reports. These genres of output are often prevalent in research areas focused on pressing development issues.

Another category of "invisible research" from the South is the considerable output commissioned by government and undertaken by consultants, many of whom are practising academics. Even when it is published, this kind of research is often not attributed to its actual authors. It has the added problem of often being embargoed - researchers sometimes even have to sign confidentiality agreements or "official secrets acts" when they are given grants.

Some complain that including these genres in our understanding of scientific research will compromise quality. But we shouldn't reject these outputs. We should find ways to prove their worth, whether through new mechanisms of peer review or new metrics that measure impact and value through use and re-use.

Access is another issue. These coveted journals generally reside behind paywalls. This excludes those who cannot afford to pay for it, like researchers in resource-constrained environments and members of the public who don't have passwords for the electronic facilities of universities and research institutions.

This situation will improve thanks to the open access policies that are currently being developed in the European Union, the UK and elsewhere. These policies will substantially increase the volume of research to which scholars and readers worldwide have access. But there's an ironic danger in this more ubiquitous availability.

If the developing world doesn't have similar national and regional policies and if resources aren't made available to actively support open dissemination in these countries, research from the developing world will be rendered even more invisible.

This may unwittingly consolidate the erroneous impression that these scholars are undertaking little of value, have little to contribute to global knowledge and are reliant on the intellectual capacity of the global north.

Solutions

Starting to change the map will require several steps. Firstly, funding and technological infrastructure must be improved. At the same time, our own perceptions of "science" must be broadened to encompass the social sciences.

Research outputs need to be recognised as existing beyond the boundaries of the formal journal article. Incentives and reward systems need to be adjusted to encourage and legitimise the new, fairer practices that are made possible in a digitally networked world.

And finally, the open access movement needs to broaden its focus from access to knowledge to full participation in knowledge creation and in scholarly communication.

Jun 23, 2015 (SciDev.Net/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- They still lack the power of their Northern counterparts, but their influence is on the rise, says Turner Isoun.

All over the world, scientists complain that governments ignore scientific evidence. And not without reason: in every field, from drugs to climate change, policies are being developed with too little awareness of the evidence that could underpin better decisions.

TD 
	

But this problem is especially acute in the global South. This is partly because few developing countries have a national science academy with strong connections to government, as is the case in Northern nations. The National Academy of Sciences of the United States, for example, or the Royal Society in the United Kingdom, have long been trusted sources of policy advice. Where academies have been established in developing nations, they have been much less powerful than their Northern counterparts, and so easy for governments to ignore.

Between 2004 and early 2015, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation put US$20 million into trying to change that reality in Africa. The money (plus additional sums from other donors) was used to support the African Science Academy Development Initiative (ASADI) in its aim to turn national academies into sustainable, effective sources of evidence-based advice.

ASADI's experience is instructive for others who might follow a similar path. There are compelling reasons to do so. For one, Southern nations lack a dense web of policy institutions so their need for research-based policy evidence is especially acute.

Powering up

I chaired the final review of ASADI, undertaken by the InterAcademy Council, a group of science, medical and other scholarly academies that provides scientific advice to international bodies. [1] It found that the initiative had succeeded in its overall aim of improving capacity for evidence-based policy.

The five academies that received the bulk of support - in Cameroon, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda - had used ASADI to strengthen their own internal organisation, for example by hiring qualified managers and finance experts. But they had also increased their ability to influence the policy process. The review counted at least 29 such interventions - mainly consensus reports offering evidence on specific issues, commonly in health and sustainable development.

In most ASADI partner nations, governments and populations benefited from this. In Cameroon, for example, both the country's National Programme on Food Security and a Food Fortification Programme backed by Unicef (the UN Children's Fund) were informed by a consensus study of research into limiting river blindness, and by other studies on nutrition and health that its academy commissioned.

There are reputational benefits to back these tangible gains. An expert from Cameroon's Institute of Agricultural Research for Development told our review team that the river blindness report shows that "good science can come out of Africa".

Number 16 of the currently proposed Sustainable Development Goals calls for the building of "effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels". ASADI has shown that active science academies are one step towards that goal.

Building effectiveness

But there is more to do. Although ASADI was a well-supported, long-term programme, science academies across the continent still tend to be small and risk being unsustainable.

To be empowered and effective, they need officers (especially high-level ones) who are motivated and trained to deal with governments, funders and other stakeholders. Candidates for this role are distinguished people with busy schedules. Although such time pressures are not unique to the global South, the rewards of being involved in a small, new academy may be less obvious than those associated with a leading role in a body such as the Royal Society.

It can also be hard for academies to hold on to or replace trained staff if they are based in capital cities and where there is a shortage of qualified middle managers, in many cases because academies cannot pay an attractive wage.

And resources taken for granted in richer nations may be less available in Africa. In my own country, Nigeria, ASADI bought generators for the science academy because an irregular electricity supply hindered its activities.

This investment has helped the academy to become an effective influence. In 2012, for example, it was asked by the charity Save the Children to assess breastfeeding in Nigeria because it was a respected source of evidence-based advice. This report was one input to legislation on the provision of workplace creches, and still influences discussions on maternity leave and national nutrition policy. [2]

Legal recognition and at least some government funding are essential steps towards building long-term stability and credibility for academies with government. Ethiopia's government, for example, recognised the Ethiopian Academy of Sciences through legislation and has called it a national asset. This political status is important. The academy is now the only non-government body with a seat on the country's Science and Technology Commission.

But it can be tricky for governments anywhere, and especially in the global South, to lend that kind of support. The money they pay to a science academy may not necessarily buy the advice they want to hear.

The next stage of the ASADI process will seek to address these issues. Called the African Science Academies Development Agenda (ASADA), it will be led from within Africa by the Network of African Science Academies made up of all 27 academies on the continent.

The aim is to build the network and national academies as sources of advice on a continental scale, to inform policy-relevant bodies such as the African Union. This is ambitious, but I believe it continues to support ASADI's original worthwhile intention: to enhance the link between evidence and policy in Africa in ways that directly improve people's lives.

Turner Isoun, a former science and technology minister of Nigeria, chaired the InterAcademy Council review of ASADI. Isoun can be contacted at isoun@aol.com. For queries about the review, contact Tom Arrison at the InterAcademy Council, tarrison@nas.edu

Jun 08, 2015 (AfricaFocus/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Editor's Note

"The prevailing international tax rules and practices, as well as the failure of governments to cooperate on international tax matters, continue to undermine the ability of governments in the Global South and the North to ensure that corporations and wealthy individuals pay their fair share of taxes ...

TD 
	

At the same time, many governments themselves act in the interest of corporations, liberally providing tax incentives and signing tax treaties that enable huge outflows of public revenues.

As a result, ordinary people all over the world carry a disproportionately heavy burden of raising tax revenues - while public services lack adequate resources to meet the needs of citizens." - World Social Forum, 2015

This AfricaFocus Bulletin contains a statement from the World Social Forum in Tunis in March 2015, outlining the concept of "tax justice" as central to fighting economic inequality both within and between countries in both the Global North and Global South.

"Tax justice," in the sense of "corporations and wealthy individuals paying their fair share of taxes," cannot of course fully "end inequality," as the headline to this document might be taken to imply. But there is no doubt that it is an essential component of any progressive agenda for checking inequality and promoting basic economic and social rights for all.

This sets a broader context for the phenomenon of "illicit financial flows," which has rightly gained increasing prominence in debates about African development, most recently through the release and endorsement of the Mbeki report by the African Union in February this year.

If these flows, defined by the Mbeki report and by Global Financial Integrity as funds that are illegally earned, transferred, or used, were to be available in Africa, and taxed for development, this would be a massive contribution to progress for the continent.

Civil society organizations in Africa and around the world, however, point out that an exclusive focus on these clearly illegal transfers must be put in the broader context of other mechanisms which may be technically legal but illicit in the sense of illegitimate and contrary to social justice.

Likewise, the borderline between "tax evasion" (illegal) and "tax avoidance" (legal but often illegitimate) is constantly changing as lawyers, accountants, and politicians collaborate in changing laws and their interpretations to the benefit of the rich and powerful.

Another AfricaFocus Bulletin released today, not distributed by email, but available on the web at http://www.africafocus.org/docs15/tax1506b.php, includes two additional background documents, one an overview on Financing for Development from the Trade Union Development Cooperation Network, and two others from Third World Network-Africa, stressing the need to put the Mbeki report's concept of "illicit financial flows" conceived narrowly as those explicitly violating the law into a broader context of other mechanisms of capital flight that may be legal but equally damaging and illegitimate.

The prevailing international tax rules and practices, as well as the failure of governments to cooperate on international tax matters, continue to undermine the ability of governments in the Global South and the North to ensure that corporations and wealthy individuals pay their fair share of taxes.

The recent "Luxembourg Leaks" has confirmed that multinationals continue to dodge taxes with impunity. This is the latest in a long list of corporate tax scandals involving major brand names including Glencore, Google, Amazon, Starbucks, Caterpillar, Deutsche Bank, Zara, McDonald's, Associated British Foods and many more. Similarly, the recent 'Swiss Leaks' has revealed that wealthy individuals hide untaxed fortunes in hidden Swiss bank accounts.

At the same time, many governments themselves act in the interest of corporations, liberally providing tax incentives and signing tax treaties that enable huge outflows of public revenues.

As a result, ordinary people all over the world carry a disproportionately heavy burden of raising tax revenues - while public services lack adequate resources to meet the needs of citizens. The continuing imposition of austerity measures and the increasing debt burden aggravate poverty and inequality within and between countries, making the need for tax justice more urgent than ever.

Meanwhile, governments are compensating for the lack of available public funding in various ways such as incurring more debt and by entering into risky public-private partnerships with the very same multinational corporations that are dodging taxation. Privatization of vital social services, where profit principally drives service delivery and overrides basic human needs, is rationalized by the need to raise domestic revenues.

Instead of cooperating to solve the problems, the world's governments continue to invent new tax incentives for multinational corporations and wealthy individuals as part of a global race-to-the bottom.

Meanwhile, rigged global tax rules fail to protect the tax bases of the world's poorest nations against erosion driven by international tax dodging. These global rules, which undermine global cooperation and ignore the interests of the poorest, continue to be negotiated and decided in closed forums of rich nations.

Continuing the tradition of the World Social Forum, which at the WSF in Porto Alegre in 2002 issued a "Universal Declaration on the right to tax justice as a component part of social justice," and at the WSF in Tunis in 2013 issued a declaration on "Tax Justice for Social Justice," we demand the following from our governments:

International cooperation for global solutions

Establish an inclusive and well-resourced intergovernmental body on tax matters under the auspices of the UN, which can initiate and lead negotiations on a new UN framework convention on international cooperation in tax matters as a first step in the reform of international tax rules.

Automatic information exchange and tax transparency for multinational corporations

Adopt a common UN standard of multilateral, automatic exchange of tax information with the option of non-reciprocal information exchange for countries with low capacity.

Eliminate secrecy of beneficial ownership worldwide through public registers of beneficial owners.

Ensure financial transparency by implementing annual public country-by-country reporting by multinational corporations.

Ensure that tax administrations are well resourced.

Progressive tax policies to tackle inequality within countries

Reduce inequality by adopting a full range of progressive taxation measures. Tax policy design and implementation must actively seek to reduce income and gender inequality.

Make it the highest priority commitment to invest tax funds in the vital human development related public services and public infrastructure (e.g., health, education, water, housing, sanitation, transportation), sustainable development, adequate social protection floors and to reverse climate change.

Provide the means for citizens to make their voices heard and hold governments accountable on their tax policy and how revenue raised is spent.

Ensure fiscal policies are gender sensitive. This should include assessing and tracking the impact of regressive taxes, such as VAT, and the tax burden, and implementing measures to shift the burden away from poor women and men.

Adopt and implement a financial transactions tax.

Fair international tax rules that make multinationals pay their share

Ensure the review of Double Taxation Agreements to bring them fully in line with sustainable development and financing for development needs and agenda.

Develop solid alternatives to the dysfunctional Arm's Length Principle.

Remove policies and treaties that erode the tax base of other countries.

To promote the tax justice agenda, we commit ourselves to:

Continue and strengthen our advocacy and campaign to influence and increase the pressure on decision makers for tax justice. This includes public mobilization and political advocacy to ensure our government leaders deliver vital tax justice decisions in the UN Financing for Development summit in Addis Ababa this July and beyond.

Enhance our efforts to create strong social movements locally and globally to force governments and challenge multinationals to end tax dodging. This includes new campaigns to make multinational corporations pay their share of taxes. We will march this May Day under the banner "Working people pay taxes - corporations must pay their share" and mobilize across civil society for global tax justice action days, including this June 23, World Public Services Day.

Promote gender justice as a key element of tax justice. This includes engaging at the national level to challenge discriminatory tax laws and ensure that tax policies recognize the invisible and unpaid care work of women.

Advance tax justice as a means to deliver climate justice by generating financing, including for adaptation and mitigation.

Work together to transform the current economic system that privileges corporations and the wealthy, drives inequality and hurts our environment. Our vision entails progressive redistributive taxation polices that fund the vital public services, end inequality and poverty, address climate change and lead to sustainable development.

We welcome that Global Alliance for Tax Justice, owned and driven by major regional networks in Africa, Asia, Latin America, North America and Europe, has invited wide civil society engagement and pledged at this World Social Forum in Tunis 2015 to collaborate and build global synergy for advocacy and campaigns and peoples' mobilizations for tax justice.

Global Alliance for Tax Justice

The Global Alliance for Tax Justice is a growing movement of civil society organisations and activists, including trade unions, united in campaigning for greater transparency, democratic oversight and redistribution of wealth in national and global tax systems.

We comprise the five regional networks of Africa, Latin America, Asia-Australia, North America and Europe, which collectively represent hundreds of organisations.

How to join:

If you or your organisation would like to get involved in the global fight for tax justice, please contact the co-ordinators of the movement in your region (see list below).

Our members:

Asian-Australian Tax Justice Network (hosted by Jubilee South)

Red de Justicia Fiscal de America Latina y el Caribe

Tax Justice Network Africa

Tax Justice Europe (hosted by Eurodad)

Tax Justice North America The FACT Coalition; Tax Justice Network-USA ; Canadians for Tax Fairness

Committed partners:

ActionAid International, ActionAid UK, Christian Aid, Christian Aid UK, Education International, Oxfam GB, Oxfam International, Oxfam Novib, Public Services International

We've joined together because:

Wealthy people, banks and multinational corporations have built a sophisticated system of secretive international financial centres (or tax havens) supported by armies of accountants, lawyers and lobbyists, in order to deliberately pay less and less tax on their profits and wealth. Yet, this elite group is entirely dependent on publicly-funded infrastructure and institutions and publiclyeducated workforces to make their money.

Such systemic tax avoidance (both legal and illegal) has led ordinary people to lose out as wealth flows outwards from the public and into the private hands of the few. This distorts economies, undermines democracy and deprives people of the vital public services we need to live.

Now is the time

There's a huge need for fair tax revenues to reverse growing inequality, to combat poverty and to invest in public services, sustainable development and addressing climate change.

There's a massive opportunity to make progress in reforming the rules when we work together across borders and organisations.

Our vision is of a world where fair and progressive tax policies support people to: - share in local and global prosperity - access the public services and social protections needed to fulfill their human rights - benefit from economies that work in the long-term interests of people and our environment

Our aims are to:

Affirm the role and obligation of governments to implement progressive and distributive tax policies

Mobilise domestic resources for public services and other vital government functions

Strengthen state accountability and the social contract

Reduce state dependence on aid and debt financing

Correct the power imbalance between citizens and multinational corporations

We do this by:

Exposing the negative impact of tax injustices on ordinary people and our families around the world -- from the South to the North

Taking transformative actions and campaigning for solutions to end tax injustices

Building a global movement to increase awareness and solidarity around tax justice issues

HD 	Counting the Costs - Reflections On Personal Vulnerability in Debates On the Migration-Development Nexus [analysis]

Apr 23, 2015 (Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The notion that migrants transmit wealth to their country of origin which ignores the cost to their families permeates the debates about migration-development links. However this is simply erroneous.

The author argues that in transnational split families with absentee fathers, non-migrant women and children pay a high price as they disproportionately shoulder the emotional loses which are part of the high and often hidden costs of migration.

TD 
	

Some of the costs which families endure are more tangible and straight forward in nature. For example, the negative returns and shortfalls in household labour. Other costs are, however, less tangible and largely indirect but having more far-reaching impacts. These include emotional stress, pain and suffering which members of migrant families experience.

These largely intangible costs are the focus of this article since they readily defy existing valuation efforts, even as they inflict damage on personal wellbeing and family life and women are often the worst affected by these dynamics.

This is illustrated through the narratives of two non-migrant women with whom the author interacted during a qualitative study of Zimbabwean transnational families.

The study employed a dual-sited fieldwork approach in South Africa and Zimbabwe (for a detailed account of the methodology used, see Chereni, 2014). Through the narratives of the two women who remain in Zimbabwe to take care of their children while their spouses relocated to South Africa to seek employment, this article reflects on what their stories might imply for how we think about the costs of migration. The author begins by providing background to the context of these women's experiences.

The Migration-Development Nexus

Academic writing and policy debates about the economic role of international migration in the development of global Southern economies often argue that, through financial remittances, international migrants can boost economic growth in sending countries and ignore the costs to their families.

Faist (2009) reviewed the recent interest in remittances and noted that more often than not, policy discourses about the links between migration and development represent migrants as smooth transmitters of wealth from resource-rich Western countries to the least developed sending countries in the global South.

Indeed, overwhelming emphasis is placed on the gains from migration including remittances and their investment potential in the national economy at the expense of the financial, social and personal costs associated with the migrant way of life (De Haas, 2010). If costs are mentioned in the current debates about the migration-development nexus at all, they are merely viewed as a loss to the national economy.

That is to say, the costs of international migration are understood in very narrow terms as 'brain drain' - a depletion of human capital in the national economy. In public policy discourse on migration, there exists a belief that financial remittances can effectively turn brain drain into 'brain gain', thereby catalysing economic growth in sending countries.

Corroborating evidence is often cited from crude comparisons between financial remittances and annual 'official development assistance' from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). According to Faist (2009), financial remittances to development countries now double (even treble) the annual official development assistance of the OECD.

The estimations of what potential remittances indicate for economic growth in sending countries exclude the various costs of migration, including the seemingly non-economic costs that families incur as a result of migration. Sending country governments view international migration as a source of windfall income. Consequently, most sending countries in the global South have put in place elaborate initiatives to enables migrants to invest in the local economy and thus reverse brain drain into brain gain.

Zimbabwe's Home Link programme which enabled nationals to invest in the property market and other sectors in their home country is a case in point (Faist, 2009; De Haas, 2010). However, the author's research shows that women have invariably paid the price for these supposedly cost-effective models of economic development.

Regional Migration to South Africa

Migration to South Africa, the main destination for migrants from other Southern African countries, remains a male-led and male-dominated phenomenon, although more women are migrating on their own right (Dodson, 2000). South Africa's criteria for admission place an emphasis on certain high-level skills, thereby restricting legal migration to a few educated elite migrants, mostly men, given the historical realities of limited access to education by women in the region.

Nonetheless, this fails to deter thousands of migrants who seek to escape the economic, social and political insecurity of their home countries. A significant number of migrants use undesignated ports of entry to 'border-jump' into South African territory and then seek asylum as a way to legalise residence.

Most asylum-seeker applications are not resolved for several years during which time the applicants are placed on a renewable asylum-seeking permit (Palmary & Landau, 2011). This permit regularises their residence, albeit for a short period, but they may not return home legally.

As in other migration contexts, researchers observe that South Africa's migration policy is oriented toward restriction, stymies spousal migration and sustains transnational separations (Dodson, 2000; Chereni, 2014). As a result, a significant number of migrant families have family members in two or more countries (Boehm, 2011; Horton, 2008).

Combined, restriction-oriented migration policies and prevailing gender-normative forms of paternal involvement are known to limit migrant men's participation in the family after departure (Parrenas, 2008). As evidenced by the case studies discussed below, this situation has far-reaching negative consequences for family life, especially for the women and children who are left behind to deal with the impacts of the migration.

Case Studies

Two case studies of non-migrant women, Chipo (38) and Nyasha (37), who remain in Zimbabwe while their spouses migrated to South Africa to seek employment, are illuminating in this regard.

The inclusion of the two migrant women in the purposively constructed sample comprising members of Zimbabwean transnational families was motivated by the author's interest in finding out how the departure of their spouses has changed family life at home. Their stories illuminate in great detail the grief they experience every day. This challenges how we ought to think about the costs and gains of migration at the family level.

Chipo

Chipo is a rural resident and subsistence farmer in the Midlands Province of Zimbabwe and a mother of three children. Consider how she relates her memories of family life before Majuru (48), her teenage boyfriend and later husband and father of her children, border-jumped into South Africa in 2005: 'Since my husband and I got married, I did not long for his company as much as I do now... We were living together as a family; we used to go to church together ... as a family.' Chipo then lunged toward the fireplace around which we sat and blew life into the dying fire which helped to warm the hut. If her non-verbal actions said anything about her longings, it must have been that she missed the joys of married life.

She continued, this time recounting the post-migration situation: 'Now that Mr Majuru has not visited us in the past two years, my desire is becoming more and more overwhelming... If he fails to visit this December, I will only farm this season only, then I leave this home with my children.' The separation is contrary to Chipo's expectations of family life and has become a source of multiple apprehensions, including marital infidelity. Consider how she pines: 'In the past, however little he gets in South Africa, he still managed to share with us and he would come home regularly. But now he spends this long [more than two years] before he visits again ... I now suspect he has another woman there.'

The minimal involvement Chipo's husband has had in the family since his departure, including his infrequent visits, living incommunicado and poor remitting behaviour, have stirred up apprehensions. She interprets her husband's marginal parental participation as a sign of a sour marital relationship and that her husband has turned his back on the family, something that gives rise to severe distress.

Chipo yearns for the erstwhile family life before Majuru's departure; she misses the quotidian communal activities of attending church and sharing meals. She is anxious of the imminent disintegration of family ties as she is considering leaving the family home, taking the children with her. This means that she will have to abandon her communal farm and she may need to explore a new form of livelihood.

At the same time, however, Chipo is willing to give her marriage a chance and she will stay for another season. As in Boehm's (2011) study of Mexican transnational families, the ambivalence of Chipo's feelings is notable here too.

She yearns for another home, a different family in a place unknown to her, even as she wishes for an emotionally intact family with her current husband. So, as the author concluded the interview later, Chipo began to question her husband's private life in Johannesburg. She said that she wants to find out if he is attending church regularly. Her intention is to gauge her husband's inclination towards infidelity by speculating on his devotion to God (and therefore to her and the family).

Chipo also indicated that she was considering going to South Africa to see for herself what her husband is doing. There was an unmistakable tone of agony in Chipo's voice as she described her multiple anxieties, including the possibility that Majuru had another family in Johannesburg and the possibility of him contracting HIV and other infections.

Nyasha

Nyasha, a 37-year-old mother of three and a resident of a peri-urban settlement in Harare, Zimbabwe, shared similar experiences of living apart from her husband. Nyasha's husband, Siwela (38), relocated to South Africa to seek political and economic refuge in 2005, leaving her with full parental responsibility at home.

When responding to the question on how she copes with living apart from her husband, she became very emotional. She recounted how her husband betrayed her: 'My husband was seeing another woman in South Africa... He was staying with this woman... That's where we started to disagree about living separately.'

She further stated: 'I was hurt. After going through this ordeal, it is hard for me to understand that he actually did not have money to send home... it really hurt me and my blood pressure went up. I feel the pain the even now.' Nyasha's observations are far from speculation.

During a separate interview in Johannesburg, Siwela conceded that he broke his marriage vows. He cited a lack of material resources and social support structures as factors that led him to compromise on fidelity. From his point of view, moving in with another woman made the difference between returning to Zimbabwe and staying on in Johannesburg. As with Chipo's story, Nyasha's narrative illustrates that transnational separation has far-reaching impacts on 'the way male and female fidelity is defined and policed by the family' (Landolt & Da, 2005: 628).

Summary of the Case Studies

Unlike Nyasha, who found out about her husband's infidelity, Chipo strongly suspects that her husband has established another family in South Africa. Nonetheless, both Chipo and Nyasha deal with more or less similar threats to marital fidelity and family life. Such threats are expected in the context of prolonged transnational separation (Landolt & Da, 2005).

For both women, it appears that the disintegration of affective family ties is imminent, as long as they continue to live apart from migrant men. Based on hindsight and suspicion, Chipo and Nyasha similarly interpret their husband's marginal involvement in the family as an indication of a weakening commitment to the marriage and family life.

This limited familial involvement generates unpleasant apprehensions for both Chipo and Nyasha: it threatens marital fidelity and challenges their beliefs and expectations of family life. Due largely to her suspicions and feelings of abandonment, Chipo experiences unbearable pain and anxiety. Unlike Nyasha, who has decided to stay, she is considering dissolving the marriage altogether as a way to achieve some relief. Nyasha describes enduring mental and physical suffering connected with her husband's infidelity. Her narrative corroborates existing accounts of suffering which demonstrate that mental distress eventually translates into physical pain (Priya, 2012).

Consequences for Advocacy and Policy

The view that discourses of migration and development seem to emphasise is that international migrants can increase economic development in sending countries of the global South and ignore the costs to their families (Faist, 2009). This view is challenged by these two case studies. The narratives of these non-migrant women who remain behind to provide parental guidance and care in the family while their spouses seek employment in South Africa may indicate the need to reconsider the way we think about the gains and losses of migration.

What is striking about the stories shared by the two non-migrant women is that transnational separations give rise to undesirable relational circumstances which threaten and damage the very core of the family. Absentee men's marginal involvement in the family is influenced by structural limitations associated with migration management and their gender-normative masculinities. Their lack of involvement may threaten and damage the ideological infrastructure of the family with great emotional and even physical strain for women.

From the foregoing, it appears that non-migrant women's beliefs about what constitutes family and the kinds of obligations that should be honoured in marriage are severely troubled. These two women experience enduring longing and estrangement at once, they are apprehensive of the security of emotional and affective ties in the family, even as they contend with severe distress, grief, pain and physical ill-health.

Therefore, as Horton (2008) argues, transnational family members live in an intersubjective space of grief and sorrow.

The assumption that migrants transmit wealth smoothly from receiving countries to sending countries is untenable. In order to debunk this assumption further, it is appropriate to consider why the migration-related vulnerabilities of migrants are largely overlooked in public policy debates.

According to Faist (2009), academic and policy about migration erroneously treat international migrants as a homogenous group of well-to-do economic agents. Furthermore, public policy discourses on the migration-development nexus almost exclusively draw on inferences on South-North migration, which may vary markedly from South-South migration in terms of returns.

This discussion indicates that embarking on migration is more costly for some groups of South-South migrants, especially low- or unskilled immigrants with perhaps only a few years of education and training.

Another reason why family members' migration-related vulnerabilities are not counted as costs is that migrant families, especially women, tend to internalise the damage from migration. Therefore, it is not surprising that governments seek to cash in on remittances while casting a blind eye to the damage and loss separated families must contend with.

However, one might argue that, in a context of male-dominated mobility, the damage which families experience as a result of migration constitutes a driver in gender inequalities.

As migrant families disintegrate and women are made to endure more and more distress, economic livelihoods (including subsistence from farm activities which sustain families) are likely to be disrupted as well.

For example, due to severe distress, Chipo has found her marriage home unbearable and considers abandoning the farm, taking the children with her as she searches for a new home. Should Chipo do so, she might relieve her suffering but she would continue to carry the burden of full parental responsibility over her children.

Conclusion

Economic perspectives dominate policy discourses of migration and development. As a result, certain kinds of migration-related costs which migrant families endure are omitted from policy discourses on migration and development.

The seemingly non-economic costs, including migration-related vulnerabilities, are either omitted on the pretext that they defy valuation or because an effort is not made to take them into account.

However, as noted above, migration-related vulnerabilities in transnational families need to be conceptualised as costs to be reckoned against the gains from migration, that is, remittances.

In order to work towards a genuine recognition of the full extent of migration-related costs for families, there is a need for interdisciplinary work suited to the documentation of the gendered nature of migration-related vulnerabilities as well as attempts at quantifying them. Whereas significant migration research exists on vulnerabilities in transnational families, it hardly engages with the dominant economic perspectives. More focused efforts are needed to inform appropriate interventions and policy on migration and its real impacts on human development.

Jan 27, 2015 (The South African Civil Society Information Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- This week Greece elected into power the left-wing political party, Syriza, headed by Alexis Tsipras, who led the party to victory on an anti-austerity ticket, thus rattling financial markets by raising the spectre of a Greek exit from the Eurozone and snubbing the European Union (EU), European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund troika of lenders to Greece.

As it turns out, I happen to be in Brussels this week, the city where the EU has its headquarters. The word on the decidedly gloomy streets of Brussels is that Greece's election result will have a potentially seismic impact, first and foremost, because it is an endorsement to reject the terms of Greece's loans with international lenders.

TD 
	

Since the 2007 financial crisis, Greece has held to a public policy that is all about austerity, or in lay man's speak, cutting back expenditure, freezing hiring, reducing salaries, retrenching workers and shrinking social benefits. Eight years into the fallout from the financial crisis, Greece is tired of being told what to do by its lenders.

More importantly, there is a growing and deep sense of shame and humiliation about the perceived loss of sovereignty to international lenders that shaped the election results.

For this reason, the Greek election is not only important for Greece but also for any country, including those in the global South, that has sacrificed its sovereignty in the name of concessional loans from international lenders.

The 2007 financial crisis saw the emergence of a hawkish and somewhat patronising consensus on the profligacy of irresponsible elected leaders.

The prevailing narrative held that the economic devastation arising from the financial crisis was less about the deception and corruption of the international financial system and more about countries shirking their responsibilities to pay for their mistakes.

The PIIGS countries of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain were lambasted for spending beyond their means with the only recipe for recovery comprising less social spending and increased taxes.

Eight years later, countries like Ireland - again the fastest growing economy in Europe - have proven that austerity can work, but the subtle qualifier is that austerity only works if there is political support for it. What is happening in Greece is not at all about whether austerity can work on its own, but rather about whether imposed prescriptions are ever viable.

To be clear, Ireland's population voted for and supported austerity, however begrudgingly, and that is why it worked. In Greece, the electorate is saying they do not want it and for that reason it has no chance of working.

So what this is about, more than anything else, is the viability of global lenders imposing governance prescriptions on countries in crisis.

In this regard, if Greece successfully pushes back against its lenders, it will open the door to countries from Jamaica to Ukraine to restructure their relationships with lenders such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).

If there is one thing to pay attention to in this emerging space, it will be the politics embedded in the technical. International lenders will assert that this is about irresponsible countries wanting to continue borrowing without having to repay their debts, but this is not at all what is at stake. What is at stake is who gets to decide what needs to be done to fix national economies?

No matter how much economic hawks portray Greece as being an undisciplined and stroppy borrower, what Greece is really saying is that its own leaders and electorate know best how to manage its own economy. The politics then is about whether Greece has the right to find its own solutions or not.

Here it is essential to keep in mind that just because Ireland agreed to the need for austerity does not mean that austerity works in and of itself, as testified by the results of this Greek election and the Zombie Italian and Spanish economies too.

The mainstream press, furthermore, has fundamentally underestimated how politically potent this narrative of national solutions over internationally proffered ones is. As importantly, the mainstream press has also underestimated the power heavily indebted countries like Greece have.

Greece owes EUR240 billion to the EU. Now that Greece has the political endorsement to do so, it can quite legitimately threaten the EU with an intentional default.

Put more plainly, with this election result Greece is saying that unless the EU gets out of micro-managing their country, it will not repay the monies loaned. No matter the cost for Greece, even hawks like Germany will do whatever they can to get the country to continue repaying. And in this regard, the Greek elections will also set the tone globally in terms of defining how much power borrowers have.

Herein lies the crux: most of the press places the bulk of the power with the borrowers and has not recognised the power that borrowers have simply because of the size of outstanding loans.

There is a saying that goes, 'borrow R100,000 from the bank and the bank owns you, but borrow R100 million and you own the bank'. If the Greeks are successful at communicating how much power they have, it will create a fundamentally changed global environment in which indebted developing countries will have a much stronger argument to push back on global lenders.

At the same time, if Greece is successfully able to continue borrowing, but on its own terms, it will undermine the assertion that the World Bank knows best.

Such a move would fundamentally alter international relations because the real power these international borrowers have is less so in the funds they lend and more so in their almost hegemonic control of the international policy space. More than anything else, the World Bank sets agendas and is an undisputed 'thought leader' on the global stage.

It attracts the best talent, finances the biggest and most important studies and disseminates its message more effectively than any other global actor. Whether it is climate change or health systems, the World Bank has likely already done the study and controls the best data available to make evidence based policy recommendations.

The Greek election is as much about renegotiating a loan as it is about the supremacy of the international architecture over national, country specific solutions.

With the global economy finally starting to recover and the ECB finally answering calls to relax austerity measures in launching quantitative easing, it may very well be the case that there is a reduced appetite to aggressively pursue austerity in Greece. If this happens, it could be an important opening for the global South to push back on the perceived authority and superiority of institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

Jan 14, 2015 (Oxfam International/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Dr. Donald Kaberuka and Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild among speakers at Oxfam-University of Oxford Symposium

Inequality is spiralling out of control, but consensus on taking action against this issue of our time is gathering pace. From Graca Machel to Christine Lagarde, Barack Obama to Pope Francis, there is clear agreement that extreme inequality is damaging societies, governance and economic growth.

TD 
	

Public debate about inequality is now prominent in spaces dominated the IMF , the World Bank and the World Economic Forum . But these voices have too often only focused on the extreme wealth found in the global North, while the causes and characterization of inequality in the global South are overlooked.

Following on from the success of last year's symposium about Africa's extractives industry and illicit financial flows, Oxfam and the University of Oxford are coming together again to examine the causes and consequences of uneven economic growth and rising inequality in the global South, while assessing policy solutions and charting a way forward for equity, democracy and social stability.

Taking part in the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month, Winnie Byanyima , Executive Director of Oxfam International, sees this symposium as a scene setter, which she is co-hosting with Dr. Nic Cheeseman, Associate Professor in African Politics, University of Oxford .

Ms. Byanyima said, "Inequality is a defining issue of our time across the world, and the extremes of it are felt most in the global South. It is a very real obstacle to prosperity as millions of people are unable to access health services and education, impacting their quality of life and life expectancy. The time to act is clearly upon us and this Symposium will explore the options we have to right the wrongs of inequality, and its root causes."

Dr. Cheeseman commented, "Rising inequality between and within nations is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. High inequality has had significant negative political and social consequences: for example, it makes it harder for people to participate and innovate in the economy, restricting productivity and growth. In poor and divided societies, it contributes to civil conflict. There is an urgent need to learn from recent experiences of rising inequality and its effects in Africa and elsewhere in the global South. To do this, we are bringing together leading experts - academics, policy experts, political leaders and campaigners - to work out how to tackle inequality and how to prevent it's most negative consequences."

Those speaking at the "Inequality in the global South - evidence and experience" session, as moderated by Dr. Nic Cheeseman, are H.E. Dr. Kerfalla Yansane, Minister of Mines and Geology of the Republic of Guinea, Prof. Nora Lustig , Professor of Latin American Economics at Tulane University, Prof. C.P. Chandrasekhar, Professor of Economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University , and Prof. Mick Moore, Professorial Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies .

The second session, "Policy solutions: resources, taxation, governance & social spending" will be moderated by Winnie Byanyima , Executive Director of Oxfam International. The speakers will be Donald Kaberuka , President of the African Development Bank, Prof. Juan Alberto Fuentes Knight, Professor at Universidad Rafael Landivar, and Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild , CEO of E.L. Rothschild. Dr. Jay Naidoo, Chair of Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition will deliver the final address.

Jan 05, 2015 (New Zimbabwe/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- IN recent days certain bold but infantile statements have been made that have caused some of us to reflect seriously on the problem of political silliness and historical idiocy in Zimbabwe.

On the subject of idiots as an intellectual and political challenge, Slovenian philosopher, Slavoj Zizek provided two defining categories.

TD 
	

The first category of an idiot is defined by the arrogant and at the same time ignorant individual who runs into a battlefield between warring soldiers and shouts at one side, "stop shooting, there are people on the other side." This idiot is idiotically oblivious of the nature of war and the context of deadly fire battle, but arrogates to himself the power to instruct and command one side of the war.

The second idiot, on the pathetic side of things, is the innocent and incorrigibly confident one that when asked by someone in small talk, "how is your day?" he goes on a pulsating and detailed description of the events of his day and his life. Though innocent, the second category of the idiot can be a nauseating reality when there is very serious business to attend to.

In the present article, I have reasons that I will advance below, to believe that Nathaniel Manheru, a paid cleaner of Mugabe's mess, is a clinical idiot who collapses in himself the two types of idiots defined above. I have no intention to hang Manheru out to dry, but my intention is to alert most of us in the intellectual and political community to the convincing falsehoods and persuasive nonsense that Manheru recently circulated in the media ( http://www.herald.co.zw/southern-zimbabwe-ending-an-overdue-myth/) and the general public sphere.

There is no doubting that many of us out there consider Nathaniel Manheru a diehard opponent of imperialism and fighter against all manner of forces colonial and oppressive.

I write here to observe that Manheru is an educated but uninformed colonised and colonising colonial subject who, while pretending to rebuke imperialism, feeds fat from what Valentin Mudimbe has called "the colonial library."

This fellow has thrown a lot of textual and verbal mud in the eyes of many a reader and listener, pretending to be a warrior against imperialism and a loyal cadre in Mugabe's ideological army, in the process concealing rather than revealing the important truth that he desperately needs firm hand-holding when it comes to understanding how the world works.

Unfortunately, the knowledge and information economy is populated by researchers, thinkers and other personages that will not allow the unhindered circulation of nonsense as wisdom. Nathaniel Manheru specifically asked to be challenged, by anyone using "national platforms" whatever that means.

As things stand Nathaniel, you are not going to choose the venue of the fight or where respondents must place their blows. Now it's Bolekaja! , come down let's fight, as the Nigerians say.

Of late Mugabe does not sleep at night in fear of assassins and other enemies, not surprising for one who has offended and wounded so many, but I think you Nathaniel are the first assassin that Mugabe should fear for when you write you really expose him as worse than Idi Amin.

Locating Nathaniel Manheru

Those that have studied literature know that in order to effectively penetrate a narrative and make sense of the form and content of a text, one has to establish the setting in time of the narrative and the historical, social and political location of the writer.

The offending article, as we have seen, was written by a Nathaniel Manheru who has his eyes on the bread. Power is changing hands in Zanu-PF and a new guard is taking over, Manheru notes this himself in the article.

As an employee; and one who feeds from the partisan patronage machinery, Manheru must work overtime to prove to Grace Mugabe, to Emmerson Mnangagwa and Phelekezela Mphoko that he is an able wordsmith that can silence angry critics and throw effective textual punches at any would be attacker of the new chefs.

Suddenly Emmerson Mnangagwa is affectionately called ED, and Grace Mugabe with her "bold frankness" is credited with bringing in new political wisdom into the party and the country. Critics of Phelekezela Mphoko and ED are viciously rubbished and threatened by a Nathaniel Manheru who admits that he is "debauched" from some binge in the village. The article which reduces the grave Gukurahundi massacres and the genocide to a "myth" is written by a Nathaniel Manheru who is dramatising his CV and displaying his "credentials" before new prospective employers.

Unfortunately for Manheru, "there is no amount of soap" in the clever words of Charles Mungoshi, or any verbal and textual antics that can wash clean the guilt for genocide that Mnangagwa and his league bear.

Recently declassified intelligence documents of the apartheid regime in South Africa confirm that Mnangagwa used to have meetings with the apartheid intelligence in South Africa to plot the downfall of ZAPU and the ANC, at the time when Mugabe was pretending to be anti-apartheid and pro-democracy. Those of you good readers who are interested in following up on the details can read Rationalising Gukurahundi: Cold War and South African Foreign Relations with Zimbabwe, an article by Timothy Scarnecchia.

A former CIO officer that Mugabe later detained, Kevin Woods, has published The Kevin Woods Story, a book that details among other things how Mnangagwa and others created dissidents, planted them in Matabeleland and created an excuse for the 5th Brigade to be deployed in the region to conduct ethnic cleansing and to destroy ZAPU. Woods also narrates how perpetrators of Gukurahundi tried to conceal the evidence of their crimes, some of them by changing their names, for example one Dominic Chinhenge changed his name to the present, Constantine Chiwenga.

For that reason, Nathaniel Manheru is in trouble if he thinks he will come up with some cheap shots to silence emerging voices on Mnangagwa's Gukurahundi guilt and his bloodied hands.

Even unfortunate for poor Manheru is that not all expelled Mujuru allies will maintain silence; they are talking and they are still to talk, more bleeding evidence of Gukurahundi crimes and the guilt of perpetrators will soon emerge.

What Manheru will achieve at this 'debauched' rate of his is to add his name on the list of genocide denialists and those who were accessories to crimes against humanity. This will not be Stephen Chan or Pigou's fault but yours Manheru.

The colonial and imperial politics of Nathaniel Manheru

Observant readers will note that Manheru, in his attempt to discredit Ndebele nationalism and to rubbish the calls of Gukurahundi victims and survivors for justice, he dismisses collective identities as a site of political struggles.

Previously, Manheru has dismissed regions such as Matabeleland and Mashonaland as manufactured and imagined figments that people must not be occupied with. The reference to Matabeleland and the Midlands as "Southern Zimbabwe" is part of the spirited dictionary attempt to erase Matabeleland and the Midlands as locations of identity, history and politics. Manheru also wishes forever to silence the voices and the history of these regions which is replete with evidence of crimes and a genocide that he prays was long forgotten.

I remember very well Manheru publicly expressing disappointment at Chinua Achebe's book, There was a Country, in which Achebe documents the history of the Biafran war in Nigeria and defends Igbo nationalism against the imperiality of Nigerian centralism. Centralism and the erasure and silencing of other voices, histories, languages and cultures are what Manheru stands for.

The kind of political thinking that Manheru is selling here is not new. Samora Machel and FRELIMO in Mozambique, from their Marxist standpoint believed that ethnic histories and identities were "false consciousness" and that "the tribe must die for the nation to live." Julius Nyerere in Tanzania, also believed that "tribal consciousness" was an enemy of nationalism that had to be eradicated.

From the outside, this political thinking appears to be admirable nationalism but in reality it is an attempt to force minority tribes and ethnicities to be swallowed up by imperial majority tribes. If this swallowing up is not done by the destruction of minority cultures and silencing of minority voices, and erasure of minority histories, it is done by ethnic cleansing and genocide as happened in the case of Gukurahundi. It is not possible to eradicate ethnic histories, languages and consciousness without eradicating some people.

In the world, prophets of Western and imperial modernisation such as Ulrich Beck ( may his soul rest in peace) have celebrated the death of "traditional societies" such as tribes and ethnicities and the birth of emphatic individualized "risk societies." Apostles of Westernised globalisation such as Anthony Giddens have also lauded the birth of one global village in the "post-traditional" era that we are supposed to be living through.

This politics of one world, one nation, one culture, at the exclusion and most times the mass murder of those that don't want to be forced to belong is colonial and imperial politics that is presently haunting the world.

American led Westernised globalisation seeks to marshal the whole world under one history, one knowledge, one politics and one culture and one universality. This politics of violent oneness projects itself in racism, Islamophobia, xenophobia and tribalism.

The so called terrorists, the perpetrators of bloody 9/11 in the United States, the Taliban and Boko Haram are peoples that have become side effects of an imperial and colonial history of a Westernised globalisation that in the words of George Bush says "you are either with us or you are against us."

These side effects of history; the excluded people whose languages and religions, whose cultures and history are being silenced, erased and destroyed tend to fight back very violently and catastrophically. Globalising and centralising politics at national or global level produces renegades, dissidents and so called terrorists who feel that they are victims of a domineering and imperial civilisation that has no place for them. The globalising and colonising model of politics that is unfriendly to minority histories, cultures and peoples has been represented in the world by captains of war like George Bush and Tony Blair who exported countless wars, overthrew regimes and destabilised the entire planet under the pretext of a crusade against terror, naming regions that were opposed to them as the "axis of evil."

It is no accident that Nathaniel Manheru refers to Ndebele nationalism as "primordial" politics. The Eurocentric colonial and imperial "civilising mission" called the people of the global south and their cultures and histories "primordial." All globalising and centralising political missions invent insults and demeaning titles for peoples and cultures that they colonise.

What Nathaniel Manheru, who belongs to a party that makes loud claims to fighting against imperialism, is doing dabbling in colonising tribalism and imperial centralism boggles the mind. If he did not know it, he should know it as from today that he is a practitioner of colonial and imperial tribal politics that feeds on the eradication of minority tribes, histories and languages.

African thinkers, thinking and writing from Africa have effectively discredited this model of colonial and imperial politics. Paul Zeleza of Malawi has complained of there being "chiefs and commoners in the global village" and has argued for the peoples of the global south to resist the erasure and silencing of their histories. Thabo Mbeki of South Africa loudly argued for a movement from "global village to a global neighborhood" where all peoples of the world can preserve their languages, identities and knowledges under the sun. The vast archive of scholars writing under the CODESRIA grouping is pregnant with works that privileged indigenous knowledges and languages as opposed to the colonial decimation of local identities and cultures. Closer to home Manheru can go to the African archive at SAPES and peruse the volumes of African texts on decolonial politics. It is a painful paradox and a very rude irony that Nathaniel Manheru of ZANU-PF is loudly amplifying the same political thinking as Tony Blair and George Bush, and using the ideas to suppress a Zimbabwean cultural and historical group.

The colonial Linguistics of Nathaniel Manheru

Some of you good readers, like myself, you circulate in universities and other institutions that have people who are paid to read, think, write and teach, full time researchers who dwell in the knowledge and information economy. Never in these corridors have I met a professor who claims to have read 'enough' of any subject in any discipline.

For that reason I was alarmed to read Manheru's claim that he has "read more sociolinguistics, done more semiotics than anyone" who is likely to respond to his article. Besides my lingering suspicion that Manheru might be educated but not informed, and that he might actually be an arrogant and ignorant idiot, I was forced to take a closer look at his understanding of linguistics which he tried to use to shout down those who were understandably aggrieved by the butchering of the Ndebele language by one entity called Chicken Slice. Being a researcher and an educator by profession, I have the patience to teach those who desire to understand those subjects that are within my province of thought, but I must say that it makes me sad to feel that I have to hand hold Nathaniel Manheru this way.

Manheru seeks to downplay the cultural imperialism and crime of Chicken Slice by reducing it to innocent "poor communication" and poor "language discipline" that can be laughed off. Those who feel otherwise are coming from "tribal narrowness" or they are disgruntled Ndebele elites thinking from far away.

I beg to address Manheru directly on this lesson that will benefit him and his like. You must remember well Nathaniel the observation by Frantz Fanon that "to speak a language is to take on a world, a culture." Fanon emphasised that "a man who has a language" consequently "possesses the world expressed and implied by that language."

What Fanon meant here Nathaniel is that a people's language carries their history, their identity and their culture. You cannot therefore, Nathaniel, believe that the butchering of a people's language can be a laughing matter unless you are the proverbial idiot that sings wedding songs in a funeral.

You must know it by now that language is a network of signs and symbols that are indexical of power relations and cultural differences. Disrespecting and messing a people's language can be compared to laughing at their gods and urinating in their temples. I know for a fact that Rino Zhuwarara, just like some of us, introduced you to Paulo Freire, Ngugi wa Thiongo and Chinweizu amongst other thinkers of Africa and the global South. So, what are you doing with this nonsensical colonial linguistics that you are even failing to explain? You make me feel that you have been a big waste of school fees. Come on Nathaniel; don't be such an excitable victim of the colonial syllabus. On language please revisit Fanon: "Language carries the weight of a civilisation." Learn that. Don't make it your pre-occupation for cash or for whatever cause to make jokes out other civilisations that are not your own.

For your benefit Nathaniel, and the benefit of others that might not know, let me explain to you your problem. When colonialism came, the colonists found our ancestors with their many gods and they replaced the many gods with one God. They found them with many languages and they sought to replace the languages with one language, the English language in our case.

Lewis R. Gordon has written that the colonists found many knowledges and sought to replace the knowledges with one Eurocentic knowledge. Where colonialism found multiplicity it replaced it with an imperial singularity. In that logic Nathaniel, decolonisation must be a defence of multiplicity. You become a colonist yourself when you celebrate the death of any Zimbabwean or African language Nathaniel! It is the duty of all decolonist to preserve the multiplicity of our cultures, identities and indeed languages.

The source of this problem of yours Nathaniel is not difficult to decipher. You have in your disposal what Valentin Mudimbe has called a "colonial library." You cite in your article, to defend your colonial linguistics M.A.K Halliday. Nathaniel Manheru; that is where your problems begin.

However, let me assist you. Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday is an agent of imperial and colonial linguistics. He was deployed by his teacher at the London School of Linguistics, John Rupert Firth to China as an attache to spread the gospel of "general linguistics," a model of linguistics that took English as the language of the world and other languages as potential languages. When Firth made the popular phrase "you shall know a word by the company it keeps" he meant many things including that the languages of backward people were backward languages.

Firth, the teacher of your linguistic hero Nathaniel was a cultural imperialist. He deployed T. F Mitchell to Arabic speaking countries, Michael Halliday to China and Frank Palmer to Ethiopia as his agents that would help assimilate other world languages to the English language. Their gospel was that languages are just "acts of meaning," and as you echo them, have nothing to do with worldviews and identity politics. These cultural imperialists and colonial linguists called themselves "generalists" who are "wandering" in the "highways and byways" of world languages. These were imperial linguistic and cultural tourists that can be compared to Joseph Conrad in literature. This gang of cultural colonist took other people's languages as museum objects and simplistic codes for the exchange of meaning, not living languages.

The work of these cultural imperialists Nathaniel was a kind of cultural and linguistic voyages of discovery. What in your side of hell Nathaniel are you doing with this imperial linguistics in your library? And how dare Nathaniel you waste space in a national publication preaching colonial linguistics to Zimbabweans in the guise of fighting imperialism? You are in the wrong basket in linguistics Nathaniel, just like you are in politics, I am beginning to suspect that in a big way you have misled the leadership of Zimbabwe with your incompetence at handling political and cultural issues in a post-colonial setting. If you Nathaniel, or anyone wishes to achieve a handle of decolonial politics, linguistics and semiotics try and read Argentinean philosopher and Semiotician, Walter D. Mignolo, and he will liberate you from your misery.

Away from that colonial linguistics of yours, Nathaniel, every language and identity in the world must exist and must have a right to be protected from vandalism by cultural imperialists and colonialists. Urgently unlearn that nonsense that you have learnt from cultural imperialists that gestures to that languages have nothing to do with identities, lives and cultures of their speakers and writers. The colonists said languages were not sacred because they wanted to savage and destroy other languages to build their own, get out of that frame Nathaniel; you are not impressing anyone but nauseating all those who understand these things better.

The Political Silliness of Nathaniel Manheru

Besides his colonial and colonising politics, together with his imperial and colonial understanding of linguistics, Nathaniel Manheru can be very silly politically. He claims, for example, that Mugabe has a "wily personality" that allows him to fool his opponents, including "like to appear dozing" in public. What are you smoking Nathaniel? Mugabe is a ninety something year old man who is doing poorly in health and who now sleeps in public and suffers frequent explosions of senility. Don't try to fool anyone; was he also being wily when he said "pasi ne ZANU-PF!" at the congress? Stop being a sit down comedian.

Grace Mugabe's rantings against factional opponents is called by Nathaniel Manheru the arrival of "new politics" in Zimbabwe and possibly in the region. This is pure baloney Nathaniel and don't repeat it in public. Grace Mugabe has squandered an opportunity to introduce new politics that is divorced from the paradigm of war and genocide by going back to the old ZANU-PF politics of insults and violence. As things are Nathaniel, the toes that you and Grace Mugabe are busy stepping on, might be toes that, as they say, are attached to hinds that you will soon be forced by history to kiss and lick. Humility in victory or in loss is the biggest strength in poilitics. As soon as the protective shadow and symbol of Mugabe is gone, that excitement that allows you to describe genocide as a myth, and that allows Grace Mugabe to rubbish war heroes and tell the men of Gwanda to stop having sex will evaporate.

There is also this silly claim that you make Nathaniel, to the effect that the Zimbabwean "masses found their power" and that there was "energy from the village" when Grace Mugabe forced Mugabe to restructure your party by expelling some of his war time comrades. Don't try to perfume nonsense and lend dignity to a bedroom coup by pretending in public that it is people power. As things stand Nathaniel you are a poet and a court jester speaking on behalf of a family oligarchy and pretending that it is a national party. The Mugabes long forgot about the nation and the party, you are a family megaphone, get used to that, and you are reporting straight from the sidelines of the bedroom.

When you patronise your "little mother" and the other unfortunate lady who married into your clan and invite us to laugh at their problems while trying to learn Shona you are not doing a good job. Tell us one other Zimbabwean language that you have tried to learn. In that episode of your "debauched" article you sound like an old colonial and slavish master laughing at a sweet little native trying to learn the language of the master.

Languages and their content are heavy historical and cultural symbols that you may not at your pleasure reduce to a comic strip, let others learn your language and learn other peoples' languages, and a nation will be built. Don't fold your hands and laugh at servile daughters in law scrambling to learn your language the way Cecil John Rhodes might have done. The Kalanga people that you wish to patronise as victims, ask them, talk to their historians and researchers, you will learn that they have a proud history and glorious legacy that your party and government has stifled and silenced. This is the same with the Venda, Tonga, Sotho and other language communities in Zimbabwe.

When you complain that your critics who are aggrieved at the butchering of the Ndebele language are elites in Harare and in the diaspora you say more than you intended Nathaniel.

I can argue now that you are sure that Gukurahundi closed all the schools, it killed most breadwinners and you are sure that no Ndebele child was educated enough to be able to challenge you except a few who escaped to the diaspora. And how do you know that it is only Ndebele people who are angry with you? Somehow you are right in that belief. The objective of Gukurahundi was exactly that, to erase a history, to silence a culture and to shut some mouths and leave only yours as the mouth of mouths, like any other imperialists you will have a world after your own imagination; but that is silly and idiotic Nathaniel, all your life you won't sleep, fearing the vengeance of some victims and survivors, not knowing when judgement will visit you. Observably, Nathaniel you are one arrogant but very ignorant quantity, so uninformed but confident in that bliss. At another level you are, as a thinker pathetic to a point of innocence and needing serious hand-holding.

Finally, for a long time now you have been complaining, Nathaniel, about the victimhood that victims and survivors of the Gukurahundi genocide are perpetually holding onto. Nathaniel, there can never be any victimhood without victimisation in the first place. Take for instance the plight of Khulekani Ndlovu, a 33 year old poor, unemployed and unemployable villager who does not have a birth certificate, or national ID, and never went to school because his parents, victims of Gukurahundi are dead and buried in a shallow mass grave in Lupane. Do you believe, even in your simple mind that Khulekani is the same villager as those that you were dancing with in Chinamhora? Can you blame Khulekani for bearing a permanent injury? Khulekani cannot even vote in the elections that you claim Mugabe always wins. Khulekani is not alone, many of his like are in Hillbrow in South Africa scrounging for survival, and they all know how their problems began. Are you not lucky that no one from ZIPRA has so far mobilised all the Khulekanis in Tsholotsho, in Hillbrow and elsewhere, trained and armed them, and came to make war upon you?

Talk first about the restraint, the responsibility and the peaceful suffering of Gukurahundi victims Nathaniel, before you rant about victimhood. Before you make the irresponsible allegation that some people are "inventing family tragedies" to appear as victims of Gukurahundi, you are only laughing at other people's bereavement, and it is not a wise thing to do.

Another Politics is Possible

It's not all lost with the colonial politics, imperial linguistics and political idiocy of Nathaniel Manheru. Zimbabwe can still achieve another politics and another life.

Politics, as those who have explored the works of such thinkers as Chantal Mouffe will confirm, can remain conflictual, with us versus them, but it can stop being antagonistic and become agonistic. There is no need for a moral register where those who oppose us in politics are enemies, but we can have fierce political competition as adversaries and not as enemies. We can move from politics as the 'will to power' and achieve politics as the 'will to live'. The Kalanga, the Nguni, the Tonga, the Venda, the Sotho, the Nyanja, the Tonga, the Shona and all other cultural and historical groupings and collective identities can be allowed to celebrate their culture and worship their gods in Zimbabwe without anyone fearing anything, it must be the job of nation builders and politicians to weave these different groupings into one political community under one flag, what Chantal Mouffe and Ernesto Laclau call, a "unity of wills." It is possible in the political to get different language and cultural communities to willfully and happily sing one national anthem without colonising and imperialising them, and that should be the mark of decolonial and liberating politics.

Dec 19, 2014 (SciDev.Net/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Science is having a moment. Science has been in the headlines this year in ways we have not seen for some time. Whether it is the health scares of Ebola and ineffectual antibiotics or the comet landing of the Philae mission, it seems the world's media have barely managed a week without needing a scientist.

Even in global development, the opportunities for scientific evidence and technological innovation seem to be burning brighter than for some time.

TD 
	

More African governments have met their target to commit one per cent of their GDP (gross domestic product) to research and development than at any other time since the African Union's creation. The debate about the successors to the Millennium Development Goals means civil society organisations around the world are talking about data science and earth systems.

In 2014, SciDev.Net tried to reflect and help contribute to this moment. Below are ten stories that we think best capture the contribution that science is making to mainstream development.

Some of the stories were particularly popular with readers, some of them were popular with other media outlets, some became part of an interesting story of change and one or two were selected because of the impact they have had on science journalism in the global South.

Of course, every story we publish has the potential for impact and influence. Every year, we have dozens of cases where an article is referenced at policy meetings, is shared by programme managers and shapes national election agendas. But what we have below are those that showed the most potential to effect change.

The problems with the arguments against GM crops

This opinion piece by Margaret Karembu got to the heart of what SciDev.Net hoped to achieve with the introduction of online debates on the site.

As one of a series of articles trailing our debate 'What's wrong with GM?' it set out an argument underpinned by evidence and managed to exercise our readers. It became one of our most applauded articles on social media for the year.

Indigenous mountain farmers unite on climate change

Good news on climate change is hard to come by. This is about as close as you will get. It describes an initiative about empowerment, common sense and potatoes. It was hugely republished by other media outlets, proving that everyone loves a 'feel hope' story.

How rats become heroes in Africa

When SciDev.Net broke the story of the success of giant rats in landmine removal in Mozambique, everyone wanted a bit of it. Our story was republished on front pages and home pages around the world. This was one of our first image galleries and, in bringing the story to life, it captured the curiosity of many a reader.

Q&A: Jeffrey Sachs on why the SDGs are big on science

All of our Q&A interviews are exclusives. This piece was so widely circulated that I once sat in a meeting with a major foundation where they started speculating about where it originally came from. Owning the knowledge is not our concern, what is more interesting is the way that Sachs describes science's impact on policy.

Big data for development: Facts and figures

The data revolution is a sprawling topic that, if we are conscientious, covers mobile operators, spying, accountable government and household surveys as a minimum.

SciDev.Net's Spotlight on the issue started with the basics though, explaining the key definitions as well as why it became part of the deliberations on the next set of global development goals after 2015 in the first place. Contributors to the Spotlight attribute the rise in their personal profiles to this collection of articles.

Solving saltwater contamination in Bangladesh

This audio slideshow is a classic example of solutions-focused journalism. It was one of the most shared stories on the site and on social media platforms. It was also crucial in shaping the way SciDev.Net would evolve its multimedia content over the year.

How to record and produce audio slideshows

The Practical guides aim to build science communication capacity for researchers and journalists. These resources continue to appeal to such groups long after they have been published, reflecting the dearth of materials to support science journalism training. This particular guide outperformed most of our more traditional editorial output throughout the year.

Interest grows in unusual Egyptian method of mosquito control

Mosquitoes were big news this year: from the advance of malaria to more temperate climates, to the continued rise of dengue and the spread of the Chikungunya virus in the Americas, all of our regional editors were interested in a mosquito story.

This piece gave a global platform to innovative research in the global South, demonstrating why the Middle East and North Africa edition, only a year after its launch in Arabic, has delivered our second largest regional audience.

Should hydropower truly be described as renewable?

This editorial asks an awkward question at a time when investment in hydropower is on the increase across the global South. It was the second most 'favourited' article across social media over the year.

Explore the global landscape of female researchers

In 2014, SciDev.Net moved into data journalism. This interactive package explores one of the more vexing and enduring issues across science disciplines around the world: where are the women? For those working on gender equity in science, it made visible the invisible, galvanising commitment to change - this includes the SciDev.Net editorial team who have built gender awareness into their commissioning guidelines.

Honorable mentions

Africa's hydropower future

Within a week of being published, this interactive data package had become one of the five most viewed pieces on the website for the year.

Gender equality should be part of basic science training

As an editor, you dream of publishing material like this: urgent, relevant and widely shared. Research funders and regional associations have taken an interest in this piece. Time will tell if this is only talk. But for now at least, they are talking.

HD 	Voices Loud, Clear and Diverse At the Cutting Edge of Sexuality Research and Activism - Reflections On Ilga2014 [guest blog]

Dec 10, 2014 (Institute of Development Studies/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The theme of the Annual Global Conference of the International Gay and Lesbian Association conference in Mexico City was 'decolonising our bodies.' Five hundred activists, academics and policy makers talked about forms of colonisation and how to identify, resist and defy it. I followed sessions that reflected areas of work of the Sexuality Programme, economic challenges and resiliencies in LGBTI communities and legal aspects of the struggle for LGBTI rights in the global south. I also visited discussions about immigration, digital security and gender identity which are some of the ascendant issues that reflect important shifts in thinking within queer spaces.

The Year of Conchita

TD 
	

I first heard the term SOGI, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, from the UN so I was prejudiced against it. I am disillusioned by social movements and community actions being instrumentalised by institutions and it is often heralded by a new acronym. But at this conference I realised that SOGI is well used which suggests it better describes the conversation than 'Lesbian and Gay' plus the various letters that have been added as history has unfolded. I was also surprised to rarely hear 'queer' but perhaps that's because it's done its job of making way for gender identities to be liberated from the binary idea that there are men and women and that transgenders and intersex people must become one or the other.

For many people their first view of contemporary challenges to binary gender identity was Conchita Wurst, winner of Eurovision 2013. Predictably some people across all sexualities were mystified, having understood the categories gay men, lesbian women and trans people as settled. But here the importance of freeing minds and bodies from binary sexuality and gender categories in the overall aim of decolonisation of queer bodies were discussed throughout the conference. As well as arguments about how and why law, medicine and anthropology should shift away from gender binaries and heteronormativity, gender activists also called for the process to begin in LGBTI communities and ILGA itself. Given the historical context in which inclusion of lesbian, trans and bisexual and intersex people in ILGA has itself been an evolution, this process is clearly still underway. The outward signs of this shift were the familiar sites of gender contestation - clothing and bathroom designation. Beards and frocks were all over the place at ILGA 2014 and the two bathrooms became three. But the third bathroom was not marked "T" in reference to binary transpersons.

"It's not the same to be a gay person with means as it is to be a gay person without means."

Fundamental human rights to life, freedom of assembly and speech, non-discrimination and access to justice are rightly at the top the SOGI agenda. But in view of the number of people at the conference from middle and low income countries I was surprised at the lack of content on economic rights in the Global South.

Micro Rainbow's research in Brazil is also an interesting exception. It shows that lesbian, gay and transgendered people are more likely to become and/or remain poor due to the stigma, prejudice and discrimination they face on the basis of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. LGBT people who live in poverty in Rio de Janeiro often deal with verbal, physical and sexual violence, and other abuses motivated by homophobia and transphobia. It argued that the lack of social and legal recognition of LGBT people, coupled with heteronormative, exclusionary policies on poverty provide a context that maintains the invisibility and structural marginalization of LGBT people living in poverty. I hope we see more research like this and that it drives demand for redress.

The World Bank provided an opportunity to engage with development policy and it was very well attended by Global South delegates. The Bank has recognised that to fulfil its mission of poverty reduction, sustainable development and shared prosperity the development process must fully respect the dignity, human rights, economies, and cultures of gender and sexual minorities; that gender inequalities and differences expose LGBTI to various forms of risk and that LGBTI communities play a vital role in sustainable and inclusive development. It convened the meeting at ILGA2014 to discuss ways in which LGBTI groups can be involved in the process of ensuring that Bank financed projects avoid negative impacts on sexual and gender minorities and promote gender and SOGIE equality. A consultation with LGBT organisations will be taking place over the coming months to develop policy including a Gender and SOGI Plan/Planning Framework that will inform the appraisals or impact assessments of Bank funded projects. Bank staff were keen to hear suggestions about how to do that. 'Be very careful not to do harm" was the loudest suggestion and perhaps after that 'Don't necessarily believe what our governments tell you about how they treat us.' The session was convened by Chad Dobson of The Bank Information Centre which is monitoring and critiquing this process.

A recurring idea about the economic consequences of homophobia and gender was that it pushes people into poverty which forces them to sell sex. Thus sex work was uniformly cast as unsatisfactory, tragic or worse. I was musing during a coffee break about the inadequacy of this discourse with a Canadian woman. Sex workers rights were fresh in her mind because of debates in Canada where sex work has recently been further criminalised (see Pivot Legal Society). She was Helen Kennedy and the next day she was elected as Co Secretary General of ILGA which bides well for more visibility for queer sex workers at the next conference.

Although quite a lot is known about the issues facing LGBTI migrants, refugees and asylum seekers there has been little attention to SOGI issues more generally in disaster relief and humanitarian aid. In the case of outbreaks of illness sexual minorities are often blamed for causing epidemics or making them worse. Gorma Togbah Kollie from Liberia said this is happening in relation to Ebola for gay, lesbian and transgender communities and people living with HIV in West Africa.

I was unsure if my impression about lack of economic and development content was correct until the European Parliament Co-President Ulrike Lunacek mentioned it as she presented the 'Go Visible' award to Galang, an organization of lesbians in the Philippines which Lunacek said stands out because it addresses economic issues. Some years back Susie Jolly wrote an article with the self-explanatory title, "Why is Development Work So Straight?" and other work at the Sexuality Programme of IDS argued that 'development theory and practice impose reproductive heterosexuality (heteronormativity) both as the only functional form of sex for its policies and as the ruling norm subjective experiences of pleasure, desire, and identity claims.' It would be useful to ask the converse now -why is LGBTI activism not more focussed on development?

Liberation and the Law

Activists from several countries where homosexuality is illegal spoke about their experience with law reform advocacy and strategic litigation. Stephen Chukwumah from Nigeria was one of several activists that spoke about the strain legal processes place on communities and about the challenge of ensuring that potential benefits are distributed. Others spoke about putting energy into different legal processes. Ian McKnight of J-Flag Jamaica spoke about the impact of intense police liaison and a clear directive by senior police against homophobia in law enforcement. He said that although miracles don't happen there has been real change. Similar stories came from Fiji. This serves as a reminder that ending police negligence, violence and misbehavior doesn't have to be complex or long term. A particularly heartening story came from SMUG Uganda. An activist is suing a US evangelical church in a US court for the damage it has caused in his life.

Several delegates spoke about the confounding logic and sheer complexity of law. Some groups have been fortunate to have skilled pro bono lawyers but even then law is a maze. I was pleased to be able to share IDS Sexuality Programme's contribution to addressing that problem, the Sexuality and Justice Toolkit.

Sonia Correa of Sexuality Policy Watch shared her thoughts about sanctioned sexuality and commented very frankly that while the law reform process must go ahead, anyone who thinks that the law or legal reform will liberate the sexually and gender transgressive is deluded. Sonia Correa and Akshay Khanna have recently compiled essays that explore and reflect on the limitations and possibilities of law reform and legal processes.

The technology paradox

Several activists spoke about digital security and the paradox that networked technologies have bought joyful, rich and lifesaving opportunities at the same time as posing serious threats. Governments are increasingly taking a keen interest in the use of this space by dissidents in general and sexual dissidents in particular. Homophobic oppression is thus disguised as fighting terrorism, pornography, trafficking and child sexual exploitation. Another threat is on-line violence which causes both direct harms to targeted individuals and indirect harm by turning people away from activism. However in the context of low income counties lack of access to high speed internet remains the most pressing problem. I was delighted to see Tactical Tech at ILGA 2014. It does great work producing internet tools to help activists overcome some of these problems.

The amazing potential of citizen controlled technology was evident in the films, photography and websites on show at ILGA2014. I managed to see the beautiful photography of Chouf, Tunisia (who also won a Go Visible award); No Easy Walk to Freedom about the Naz Foundation's challenge to Indian anti sodomy law; three short films about the work of BeLong Ireland with asylum seekers and "The Son I Never Had" about the experience of an intersex person.

Nov 18, 2014 (United Nations Development Programme/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Washington D.C., USA

Your Excellency Ambassador Abulkalam Abdul Momen, President of the High Level Committee on South-South Cooperation and Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the UN;

TD 
	

Your Excellency Ambassador Kingsley Mamabolo,

Chair-elect of the Group of 77 and Permanent Representative of South Africa to the UN;

Ms. Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary General of Secretaria General Iberoamericana;

Mr. Jose Miguel Insulza, Secretary-General of the Organization of American States;

Mr. Christian Friis Bach, Executive Secretary of UN Economic Commission for Europe;

Mr. Jon Lomoy, Director of OECD-DAC;

Mr. Yiping Zhou, Envoy of the UN Secretary-General and Director of the UN Office for South-South Cooperation;

Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good morning and welcome to the 2014 Global South-South Development Expo.

Allow me to first warmly thank the Organization of American States and Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza for generously hosting the Expo in Washington DC.

Let me also congratulate the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation - proudly hosted by UNDP - for organizing the Expo and for being a champion of co-operation and partnership across the global South.

The theme of this year's Expo, 'Scaling up South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Sustainable Development', is particularly timely.

Next year, in 2015, world leaders will meet in Addis Ababa at the Financing for Development Conference, in New York for the UN Summit to adopt the new post-2015 agenda, and in Paris for the UN Climate Conference. The convergence of these and other important fora make it a decisive year. The decisions made will put the world on a trajectory to greater sustainability, equity, and prosperity - or move it further away. South-South and triangular cooperation already does - and can increasingly help us to get on track.

UNDP takes a proactive approach to supporting and facilitating South-South and triangular Cooperation because we are convinced - it is a necessary piece of the sustainable development puzzle. Without more and more effective cooperation, collaboration, and partnerships - including across and between countries in the Global South - the world is likely to fall short of addressing its shared and pressing challenges, and miss out on the opportunity to improve the lives of people everywhere. With so much on the line, this is a risk we all cannot afford to take.

South-South cooperation is a central part of the rise of the South and the good news is that South-South cooperation is already embedded in the way countries in the Global South do business.

Let me give you some quick facts. From 2008 to 2009, developing countries exported more to one another than they did to developed countries. Since 2011, developing countries have traded products and services worth more than $4 trillion dollars.

Investment flows to developing economies, much of it originating from the South, reached a new high in 2013, accounting for 52 per cent of total global foreign direct investment. In 2011, the value of South-South development assistance was estimated to have reached between $16.1 billion and $19 billion. By some accounts, the real value is higher.

The result has transformed the world economy and altered international relations forever. Hundreds of millions have been lifted from poverty - joining the ranks of the growing global middle class.

However, such achievements are undoubtedly uneven - within and between countries in the South. Rapid environmental degradation, extreme weather events, social instability, and violence have also left much of the new middle class feeling vulnerable - while threatening the livelihoods and lives of those confined to poor communities.

No one is safe from climate change, deforestation, water pollution and increasingly extreme natural disasters.

Without clean water, healthy air, or safe climate - no one can profit or prosper. A balance between economic growth and measures that improve people's lives will raise the prospect of our societies and protect the one planet on which we depend.

The Global South has the biggest stake in ensuring that growth and prosperity is sustained, inclusive, and extends across the South. Through South-South Cooperation, countries in the Global South are acknowledging that their fates are intertwined, and that they must spare no effort to ensure that the jump in human progress is sustained. There are many encouraging examples:

- The Sister Cities International Sino-African Initiative is a trilateral partnership among the cities of Nairobi in Kenya, Denver in the USA, and Kunming in China. This initiative aims to ensure development and poverty alleviation projects address community needs, and promote transparent business practices and government accountability. As a result, access to safe water and toilet facilities to schools are successfully expanding in Nairobi.

- India IMPEX's SUNLITE Off-grid Solar Lighting Initiative has developed a simple lantern that works for approximately 8 to 9 hours on a single day's charge. UNHCR has procured these innovative solar lanterns for refugee camps in Kenya, Liberia, Sudan and Uganda, among others.

- Thus far, this South-South initiative has planted millions of hectares of biomass for ethanol and biodiesel production; 100,000 jobs have already been created in the first phase; youth have received leadership and management training; dependence on fossil fuel has been reduced by 10 per cent of total consumption; electricity has been distributed to remote communities; and the beneficiary population is currently about 1 million people.

- In Africa - Angola, Namibia and the Republic of South Africa have formed the Benguela Current Commission by which the three countries work together to protect an ecosystem that is highly rich in fish and other marine natural resources, across their shared coastal waters in the Atlantic Ocean.

These global examples are a testament that solutions often emerge from where the challenges are. We know that at UNDP and we are more committed than ever, and uniquely prepared, to support development partners in their efforts.

- We have placed South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation at the core of UNDP's Strategic Plan for the period 2014-2017.

- Facilitating South-South and triangular cooperation, is central to UNDP's ability to obtain development results. Through our presence on the ground in 177 countries and territories, UNDP offers global perspective, local insight, capacity and skills to link countries and communities to knowledge, best practice, and lessons learned.

- We have established global policy centres in Brazil, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Turkey to facilitate South-South policy coordination and other interactions. We are also supporting initiatives under seven strategic partnership agreements that we have signed with Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Turkey.

- UNDP has also declared its commitment to become a knowledge broker, through initiatives to identify, share, and adapt scalable and tested solutions from the South.

I am very pleased that UNDP is joining so many other UN organizations here, along with a high level representation from Member States, to showcase successful South-South and triangular partnership solutions.

The challenge we face now is to find ways that would enable us to effectively scale up proven solutions widely, and sustainably, together.

South-South and triangular cooperation offer a path to balancing growth and equity in the context of a new collaborative Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, where all stakeholders stand shoulder to shoulder in their political, economic, social, and environmental development efforts.

The spirit of solidarity that inspires South-South and triangular cooperation creates the space for developing countries to share lessons on policy choices, business models, and technological innovations that have been effective in lifting millions out of poverty.

Yet despite this impressive progress, one child in five still goes to bed hungry, 1.3 billion people still live in extreme poverty, 2.5 billion people still lack access to decent sanitation facilities, women and girls continue to face gender discrimination and violence, and climate change and greenhouse gas emissions still pose a major threat to populations and ecosystems.

South-South cooperation holds the promise to make a difference in the lives of millions.

As we approach the 2015 MDG target date, it is clear that strengthened efforts are needed to accelerate progress. And critical to success are broad-based global partnerships for sustainable development.

All development partners are here this week. And together, we can achieve much, much more than we can even imagine on our own.

I wish you all a very productive and rewarding Expo.

Thank you!

Oct 23, 2014 (GEGAfrica/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Thirteen years ago the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially promised to put developing states needs at the forefront of international trade negotiation agenda.

The start of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations, in November 2001, saw the adoption of a Ministerial Declaration that was a positive response to the anti-globalisation riots and challenges seen at the ends of the 1990s. The five-day protests called the 'Battle of Seattle', which resulted in the opening ceremonies and the initial session of the WTO being effectively shut down, was a clear example of the developing states people's and developed state activists' belief that the policies of the WTO were unfair.

TD 
	

Although the Doha Round promised to tend to the needs of developing states, the reality has, to a large extent, been that this promise has not manifested. The needs of the global South continue to be ignored and developed states continue to make decisions based on their economic and political interests. Before describing the manner in which the goals, specifically of African states have been side-lined, it is important to understand the reality and make-up of the WTO.

This blog forms part of a special series of student articles on global governance.

The WTO was established in 1995 as part of the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. The result of the negotiations was the decision to put in place a political institution that would advance the neo-liberal trade policies and oversee the global expansion, of capitalism. This new institution would be responsible for administering a new body of global trade rules.

At the core of the WTO is the strong belief that neo-liberal free trade is the only viable universal working option that can provide long-term answers to both development needs and wealth creation.

The WTO, in many ways, is seen as an educator that has the purpose of educating state participants and their citizens that economic liberalism is the correct way forward and that any revision through state intervention or protectionism will lead to stagnation or a reversal in development and wealth creation.

The organisation legitimises neo-liberalism and acts as an independent super-national body that has been argued to have de facto reduced the power of the state in order to ensure it adheres to WTO mandates, thereby entrenching the neo-liberal order and importing a hegemonic agenda into trade negotiations. The WTO has presented itself as the central agent in the process that strengthens the hegemonic projects of globalisation and neo-liberalism.

Most attempts by developing states to significantly improve their trade relationship with the West in this context have essentially led to failure. The failure of WTO members to agree on a way to reduce large developed state farmer subsidies illustrates this. The over-production by these developed state farmers still presents a severe threat to the livelihoods of farmers in developing countries.

Many in the developing world have argued that the WTO's failure to clarify ambiguous rules on concluding trade agreements is deliberate, as it created a space for developed states to manipulate the global South. An example of this can be seen in Africa, where negotiations with the EU under the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) have led to African states being pressured to eliminate tariffs on up to 90% of their trade, stemming from there being no clear rules to protect them. Provisions on 'special and differential treatment' were created to make trade negotiation rules more precise, effective and operational and thereby support developing countries, but the WTO has failed to fill the legal vacuum and the outcome can be seen in the EPAs.

The inability of the WTO to create agreements that address the realities of developing nations has, to a large extent, created harsh consequences in the global South. The ability for African states in particular to engage in dispute settlement under the WTO is basically non-existent. The WTO has pledged to improve access to what many argue to be an expensive and complex legal system, but in the 18 years of dispute settlement there have been over 400 cases initiated and yet not one African country has acted as a complainant. This emphasizes the failure of the WTO to create space for African states to engage in legal processes.

Another failure of the WTO to clarify ambiguous rules can be seen in the inability of many developing states to access affordable medicine, because members have not differentiated between the need for governments to protect public health on the one hand and the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies on the other.

A fundamental issue which reveals the WTO's unfair nature and failure with regards to integrating and assisting developing states has been its failure to make trade fair. The Doha Development Round has yet to be concluded, and has failed to hear the voices of people from the least developed states. This has perpetuated realities that lead to poverty and despair.

Over 50 billion dollars in subsidies, for example, has been paid to developed states farm producers since the start of the Doha Round, creating barriers for 15 million farmers across West Africa. This reality has also forced more than 5 million of the world's poorest farmers out of business, who thus find themselves in even deeper poverty because of such subsides.

The purpose of this blog is to highlight the failures and unfair nature of the WTO. Its failure to live up to its promises points to a systematic problem in the global community. The reality is that there is no political will to commit to any fair change which could lead to lasting change in the economic realities of developing states.

The developed world has arguably used the WTO to pressure the developing world to adopt neo-liberal policies that allow developed countries access developing markets but this interaction has not brought about the desired economic and social growth in the global South that was promised. Any lasting solution would need an institution that is more democratic, fair and gives space for the voice of developing states.

Oct 22, 2014 (Congress of South African Trade Unions/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Chairperson of the session,

National Office Bearers of the ANC and NEC members

TD 
	

Chairperson of the IR Sub Committee, Comrade Bapela

Members of the Sub Committee

Comrades in the house

COSATU takes this opportunity to welcome this important space for reflection and critical feedback about our work, particularly in the international arena, as a movement, alliance, government and as a people.

We have always been guided by the most advanced values of internationalism and solidarity at the height of our struggle against apartheid, because we were doing what a liberation movement as a force for progressive change, is principally about.

In assuming state power, we had to occupy new spaces which came with their own strictures and limitations, some of which we ourselves imposed on our work as new languages, cultures and codes of behaviour changed our political and ideological out-fits to suit the new terrain.

We have, undoubtedly made progress in several spheres, but we must avoid being casual about the new terrain and what has happened. We must be ready to face hard and uncomfortable questions about our work, the state of progressive forces and the global balance of power today.

COSATU is not exempting itself from these hard questions, which we also are hard at work grappling about as we seek to find the most appropriate ways forward.

The question before me today is regarding the state of the international trade union movement in the world today and what prospects it holds for real and progressive change towards a new and just world order.

So much can be said about it, but let me get to the most salient points we would like to raise about this important subject; COSATU was born in 1985 at the height of the struggle against apartheid, in which international solidarity was a key pillar of our struggle, hence the centrality of our internationalist outlook. International solidarity is one of the founding principles of the federation, which clearly spells out that our domestic struggles are intimately connected to the struggles being waged by workers all over the world. In the words of Karl Marx, "workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains". This is precisely because capital knows no boundaries and exploits workers wherever such a possibility presents itself.

We are guided by 6 Objectives of our international work, which are;

- Building a strong, united, worker-controlled and progressive international trade union movement

- Fighting for global economic justice

- Fighting for human and trade union rights, an end to all forms of oppression, and the pursuit of social justice all over the world

- Fighting against climate change and for environmental justice

- Building, promoting and defending working class alternatives to neo-liberalism and capitalism

- Building the required capacity, systems and infrastructure to effectively pursue our international objectives

In doing all of this work we base ourselves on the principles of working class internationalism, anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism, unity of workers, practical and concrete solidarity activism, rejection of racism, sexism, homophobia and all other forms of inequality and oppression, democratic worker control and alliances with other progressive forces beyond the workplace.

It is important for us to introduce these basics in order to locate correctly the arguments and issues we shall raise as we engage deeper into this discussion about the state of the international trade union movement.

The trade union movement and the broader working class are waging struggles in the era which according to the theory of imperialism is defined by two primary elements;

- The internationalisation of production, circulation and investment of capital

- The interpenetration of private capital and the nation-state, leading to emergence of foreign policies based on the intersecting interests of the dominant forces at the helm of power in both the private and public spheres of society

The International trade union movement - a cocktail of "strange" allies as social forces in unity and struggle

There are two main bodies of the international trade union movement today; the WFTU and the ITUC. They represent different ideological and political outlooks on major questions facing humanity today, particularly facing the working class. I shall not delve into the specific orientation of each one of them, but shall generalise the trends, tendencies and approaches in the context of the broad struggle of workers.

The most defining feature of the world trade union movement today is that, like states, it is characterised by unequal power relations, particularly between the north and the south. The trade unions from the industrialised countries of the north largely see themselves as having a share in the existing world system and therefore, having the responsibility to defend the key features of the obtaining system. They feel threatened, in many cases, by the militancy and fighting power of the working class from the global south.

They collaborate with their ruling classes in the sustenance of the key features of the dominant global system and in neutralising the fighting power of workers from the global south for the radical restructuring of the global political and economic system.

This tends to be the key defining feature of the international trade union movement, where the struggle within the struggle takes different forms and gravitate towards narrow national chauvinism rather than international solidarity and justice for all workers.

The main defining features of the international trade union movement tend to be;

- Concentration of power mainly in the global north, where the trade unions have the most resources than all of us

- Over-bureaucratisation of processes, decision-making and resources in the hands of those who wield more power

- Peripheralisation and marginalisation of the global south and their roles, particularly in leadership positions, except in ceremonial and symbolic positions

- Focus and agenda largely set by the powerful unions in the global north

- The northern unions are highly organised and operate in a group fashion, while we in the south are less organised and tend to operate as individual countries, unions or areas

- Issues that threaten the interests of the global north and their ruling classes often fail to make the agenda, such as Palestine, Cuba, Western Sahara and Colombia, together with fair and just trade for the industrialisation of Africa, as well as confronting multinational companies for looting our natural resources

- The Africa region is the least influential, with less vibrant traditions of activism, resulting in conventional and orthodox forms of lobbying that yield no result on major questions nationally and globally

The African trade union movement and its posture today

Our main focus and interest is our own continent, which is our backyard. There are three trade union centres on the continent; ITUC-Africa, WFTU-Africa and OATUU. There are also regional trade union bodies, such as; SATUCC in Southern Africa, OTUWA in West Africa, EATUC in East Africa, the Mahgreb Trade Union Forum and ICATU in North Africa And parts of the Middle East, as well as a Central African trade union coordinating body.

The weak state of the African trade union movement resulting from its weak national and local structures, in many parts of the continent leaves society at the mercy of ruthless ruling classes and multinational corporations. In several African countries, the trade union movement is the last line of defence, where political organisations are either banned or too weak or even part of the ruling elite, in some instances with NGOs sharing same traits too.

The African trade union movement as a result of its weak state, fails to articulate the practical issues, real class aspirations and political interests of workers in many cases, hence their irrelevance to the majority of workers and society.

In those cases where they play their role effectively, they lack support and solidarity from major parts of society, resulting in isolation and finally, defeat. But various elements of the trade union movement on the continent are held back by conservative class collaborators, as was the case in Egypt where ETUF was lackey of Hosni Mubarak and contained the whole working class struggle.

The biggest problem is when the trade union movement is so divorced from the most fundamental issues of the continent's political economy to the point of failing to articulate the broader political economy agenda for industrialisation to confront underdevelopment, backwardness and poverty, compounded by joblessness.

In summary the African trade union movement is defined by the following features;

- Weak organising and campaigning capacity

- Weak capacity for research and policy analysis to engage on matters of national and continental importance

- Poor leadership, at times undemocratic perpetuation of individuals in power, without and form of worker control and due democratic processes

- Poor women representation, participation and involvement

- Poor financial and resource capacity to do effective work

- Over-reliance on patronage and external funding which results in undue external influence and control

- Undemocratic political environment in most instances, resulting in crushing of workers struggles

- Weak conceptualisation of the real problem facing Africa, to the point of substituting it with manifestations of the problem, such as poor working conditions, which gets divorced from the real political economy base of underdevelopment and neo-colonial accumulation.

Conclusion

We hope that in our attempts to draw general conclusions and trends from the various parts of the international trade union movement, we have not sent confusing signals about what the salient points and key defining features are and what would be required to build a vibrant, clear and advanced trade union movement, with the requisite political and organisational capacity to drive a decisive and bold agenda.

Sep 15, 2014 (UN News Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Cooperation between and among developing countries offers a path to balancing growth and equity, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said today, marking the United Nations Day of South-South cooperation with a call to encourage - and learn from - emerging partners in the global South to promote prosperity for all.

"Let us reaffirm our commitment to pioneering South-South approaches that will ensure shared prosperity, sustainable development and a life of dignity for all," Mr. Ban said in his message on the Day.

TD 
	

Despite the recent successes in the Millennium Development Goals, Mr. Ban warned that progress across the South has been uneven. He stressed that "extreme poverty, rampant inequality, malnutrition and vulnerability to climate and weather-related shocks persist."

To mark the importance of South-South Cooperation, the General Assembly decided to observe this Day on 12 September annually, commemorating the adoption in 1978 of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries.

Echoing Mr. Ban's assertion that South-South cooperation as an essential component of international cooperation, John Ashe, President of the General Assembly, said in a statement that " [it also] offers viable opportunities for countries of the global South to explore new avenues for technical collaboration as a part of North-South and triangular engagement."

Further spotlighting the advantages of South-South cooperation, Mr. Ashe said: "Countries of the global South can gain additional access to finance, technology and markets."

"Investments by developed and developing partners in infrastructure can also help diversify economies, lead to further agricultural productivity, and advance overall economic development of the countries of the global South," he said.

Gilbert Houngbo, Deputy-Director General for Field Operations and Partnerships of the UN International Labour organization (ILO) stressed that the agency has been a key player in presenting good practices and solutions from the global South, as well as from traditional partners, through the triangular cooperation modality, which includes Governments, employers' and workers' organizations.

Zeroing in on top priorities of creating decent jobs and reducing inequality, Mr. Houngbo said that "South-South and triangular cooperation is yielding some of the most innovative solutions to eradicate poverty."

It is also noteworthy, according to Mr. Houngbo, that the ILO Governing Body adopted in 2012 a strategy for South-South Cooperation, galvanizing concrete efforts in engaging partners, while promoting projects in the fields of combating child labour and forced labour, promoting youth employment, environmental sustainability and social protection for all.

Istanbul, Turkey, Jun 19, 2014 (United Nations Development Programme/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Trends and Emerging Opportunities - Perspectives of the New Actors

UNDP is very pleased to be a co-host with TIKA of this conference on International Development Co-operation: Trends and Emerging Opportunities - Perspectives of the New Actors.

TD 
	

We are especially pleased to be meeting in Istanbul where UNDP is about to complete the relocation of its Regional Centre for Europe and the CIS. We greatly appreciate the support of the Government of Turkey for UNDP's work within this country and at the global and regional levels, including for UNDP's Istanbul International Centre for Private Sector in Development.

At the outset, let me also acknowledge the significant and growing contribution of Turkey to the global development agenda overall, both as an important funder and partner, and in global development discourse. UNDP has recently partnered with Turkey on a regional post-2015 consultation, and on high level consultations on the role of law and of what the private sector can contribute on disabilities in the emerging global development agenda. We are pleased to be working with TIKA on strengthening its capacity in South-South co-operation - an area which is very relevant for our discussions here today.

This conference provides a good opportunity to examine the role of South-South and triangular co-operation in accelerating development and thereby improving the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable people around the world. My comments will focus on the new development actors in the Global South, but let me also acknowledge the critical roles played by philanthropy, NGOs, civil society, and increasingly the private sector too.

The Forum is timely - the ideas and evidence discussed here can feed into the meeting of the UN Development Co-operation Forum in July, which is focused on how to "Bring the future of development co-operation to post-2015".

South-South Co-operation

South-South co-operation, understood as a mutually beneficial partnership based on solidarity, equality, and shared development experiences, is growing fast. Southern innovations and experiences are often seen as the most relevant to the challenges faced by other developing countries.

Among trends we are seeing in the Global South, the following stand out:

- The share of South-South trade in world commerce has more than tripled over the past three decades to over one quarter of the total. South-South foreign direct investment grew at a rate of twenty per cent a year between 1996 and 2009, and now accounts for thirty to sixty per cent of all foreign investment in the Least Developed Countries. Recent Chinese and Indian joint ventures and startup manufacturing investments in Africa could foreshadow a significant expansion of such activity.

- Southern countries and their development banks are making substantial investments in infrastructure in Asia and Africa. For example, Turkey has supported Somalia's transport sector, including by helping rehabilitate Mogadishu airport. China recently announced plans to support building a rail link in Kenya between the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa and Nairobi. The plan is to extend the links from Nairobi to Kampala, Kigali, Bujumbura, and Juba. Exim Bank of China will finance ninety per cent of the first stage, estimated at $3.8bn, with Kenya financing the remaining ten per cent. Modern rail linking the coast to the hinterland will be a big boost for the region.

- In the health and social sectors, we see the large scale manufacture of lower cost medicines for HIV and other medical conditions in large emerging economies like India and Brazil. We see knowledge sharing across the world's regions on cash transfer schemes which aim to boost incomes of the poor and health and education status.

- We see more co-operation on citizen security in Latin America and the Caribbean. Colombia, for example, has provided training to other nations' security forces on fighting transnational drug trafficking and others forms of organized crime. Sub-regional organizations like the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) are driving regional dialogue on strengthening citizen security.

- The South is now a significant producer of low-carbon technologies and innovation. In renewable energy, Brazil is a hub for the production and use of biofuels, while China and India are leaders in the supply of solar power technologies. Taken to scale with lower costs of production, these technologies can help drive the transition to green economies across the Global South.

Towards a Post-2015 World - new actors and big challenges

Tackling the major global challenges, from poverty and high levels of inequality to climate change, infrastructure deficits, and illicit financial flows, requires the full engagement of the widest possible range of development actors. It will be important to understand how collaboration can enhance middle-income countries' efforts to curb inequalities through inclusive growth and innovative social policy. At the same time, we also need strengthened collaboration for countries in more challenging situations, including the Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, and countries emerging from conflict. Let me briefly address each of these:

Middle-Income countries

- South-South co-operation offers a good framework for collaboration between middle-income countries. For example, China and Thailand have established a Joint Action Plan on China-Thailand Strategic Co-operation (2012-2016), to deepen co-operation on issues such as water resources management, renewable energy, education, and human resource development.

- In 2013, eleven Middle Income Countries met in Beijing to share their experiences of planning and implementing development co-operation. This conference was supported by UNDP and the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation (CAITEC). Following additional consultations, there is now a proposal which has broad support from Middle Income Countries for the establishment of a Network of Southern Think-tanks (NeST). This will be a voluntary initiative, led and driven by think tanks in the South, to deepen the understanding of South-South co-operation's contribution to global development.

Least Developed Countries

- In line with the Istanbul Programme of Action, South-South co-operation is helping to build the productive capacities of LDCs. As well, targeted collaboration is supporting LDCs to engage in trade, attract investment, and participate in production networks and value chains serving growing markets throughout the Global South.

- China, India and Thailand are among the fastest growing markets for LDC exports. The Government of Malaysia is helping to develop information technology expertise for Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar. TIKA is providing assistance in education, health and other sectors in eleven LDCs, including in Burkina Faso, Gambia, Mauritania, Sudan, Senegal, and Yemen.

- Neighborhood initiatives among LDCs are another important form of South-South co-operation which is being used to boost national development. For example, with UNDP's support, Lao PDR shared its successful experiences of a radio programme serving indigenous communities with Cambodia; and Uganda shared its experiences on sustainable land management with Tanzania - which informed the land management programmes in Kilimanjaro.

- For Small Island Developing States, South-South and triangular co-operation are offering promising solutions to some of their most pressing concerns; for example, in strengthening climate resilience.

- While there is no 'one size fits all' blueprint for making the transition to low-carbon and climate- resilient development, South-South co-operation can help countries shape their own, nationally appropriate paths to sustainable and inclusive development. Experience-sharing on disaster reduction and climate change adaptation and on "triple-win approaches" which advance the economic, social and environmental strands of sustainable development simultaneously, are important. Through the exchange of low-emission technologies and technical know-how, countries can lower the costs of sustainable solutions and strengthen their ability to access and deploy climate finance.

- UNDP has initiated the Caribbean Risk Management Initiative (CRMI) to facilitate knowledge-sharing between Small Islands Developing States (SIDs) in the Caribbean and the Asia Pacific on management and mitigation of climate-related risks, including of hurricanes and rising sea levels. Exchanges between the relevant agencies in the Caribbean and Pacific regions are being supported, which is also helping to ensure well-co-ordinated SIDS positions in international fora on disaster risk management.

- In November, the Second UN Conference on Landlocked Developing States will be held in Vienna. It is a ten-year review conference, which will report progress on the Almaty Programme of Action and lay out a new agenda to meet the specific needs of these states - not least in building capacity for trans-border trade and transportation. There will be many opportunities for new development actors in supporting the new agenda.

- For countries emerging from conflict, South-South co-operation creates opportunities to draw on the unique experiences of other countries which have faced similar challenges on the long and complex road to peace. Such countries bring invaluable insights on how to transform national institutions from within, to restore state authority, empower civil society, and revitalize economies. Liberia, for example, has co-operated with Botswana on the capacity development of the Liberian police force. At the global level, a g7+ "fragile-to-fragile" platform is being established with UNDP's support, to share knowledge and expertise among fragile states on peacebuilding and state building.

Mobilizing Resources

It is important to affirm that South-South co-operation is not a substitute for Official Development Assistance, but rather, a vital complement to it. High quality, catalytic, and predictable Official Development Assistance (ODA) will remain important for poverty eradication, especially in Least Developed Countries. Traditional donors must meet their longstanding ODA commitment to dedicate 0.7 per cent of their GNI to ODA, and, recognizing the central role for poverty eradication in LDCs, also meet the target of contributing 0.15 per cent of GNI to LDCs in particular. Future development co-operation must also take into account the fact that the majority of the world's poorest people reside in middle-income countries.

Financing needs for development, however, are vast, and will need to be met through a mix of public and private finance and other means, including carbon market mechanisms. While the MDGs have been perceived as largely a North-South, ODA-supported agenda, the SDGs will be a universal agenda for which diverse sources of financing will be even more important. In this context, South-South and triangular co-operation, can also offer new opportunities. A number of emerging economies are building up their development co-operation agencies: these include the Mexican Agency for International Development Co-operation and the South African Development Partnership Agency. Others are already very active in, or are expanding, their existing South-South co-operation, not only in the form of grants and loans, but also through trade and investment.

UN and South South Co-operation

Support for South-South and triangular co-operation by UN organizations and agencies has surged in recent years. Many have included South-South and triangular co-operation in their strategic plans; have sponsored South-South policy dialogues, the exchange of knowledge and experience, and research and analysis; and are supporting regional integration efforts - among many other initiatives. In UNDP, we are committed to promoting and strengthening South-South and triangular co-operation and have placed these at the heart of our work in our new Strategic Plan. We are committed to becoming a knowledge broker and to helping to identify, share, and adapt scalable and tested Southern solutions. We have been the proud host of the UN Office for South-South Co-operation for many years, and regard it as an integral part of our global operation.

UNDP's International Policy Centres, established in Brazil, Kenya, Republic of Korea, India, Norway, Singapore, and Turkey, help identify and disseminate knowledge which can then be further transferred through South-South and triangular co-operation. These centres of excellence cover inclusive growth, sustainable development pathways, dry land development, global partnerships, democratic governance, public service excellence, and the role of the private sector in development.

We will continue to support countries to engage in and benefit from South-South and triangular co-operation, and we are committed to engaging with new partners, including across the non-governmental actors, in the development and implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.

I wish this conference every success, and have every expectation that its deliberations will enrich the discussion at the UN's Development Co-operation Forum in New York next month..

Jun 09, 2014 (Daily Trust/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- In my two-part column titled "12 Popular Misusages in Nigerian English" (published on April 13, 2014 and on April 20, 2014) I identified "South-south" as the 11th most popular error in Nigerian English.

Shortly after publishing the article, a number of my readers advised that I give exclusive attention to the expression given its prominence in Nigeria's contemporary political lexicon and the fact that it may be conferred permanence and false prestige in a new Nigerian constitution that members of the ongoing national conference may write. They argued that listing it among 12 other errors might lead it to be missed by those who should see it.

TD 
	

I am persuaded by the reasoning of my readers. That's why I have decided to expand on what I wrote about the phrase. However, I am under no illusion that my writing about it will cause the Nigerian political class to abandon it, especially given the legendary anti-intellectualism of Nigeria's leaders. Plus, the expression seems to have already been firmly entrenched in the everyday mental lexicon of ordinary Nigerians.

Nonetheless, for whatever it's worth, I think there is merit in putting it on record that the Nigerian geo-political designation "South-South" offends several usage conventions in English and deserves to be thrown into a verbal garbage. While it is perfectly permissible to invent new fangled expressions that push the lexical and semantic boundaries of the English language (that is what, after all, makes the English language such an exciting and progressive language), we should draw the line where pointless lexical experimentations have the potential to impair mutual intelligibility in international communication. "South-South" is one superfluous neologism that the Nigerian political elite--and the Nigerian news media that parrot them uncritically--will do well to cast away.

The expression makes no cartographic sense, isn't part of the institutionalized cardinal or ordinal directional nomenclature, violates established naming conventions, and competes against a similar expression whose meaning has been rigidified in the vernacular of international relations for ages, as I will show shortly. Plus, it's needlessly repetitive and, frankly, unimaginative. In any event, if it makes sense for Nigeria's political elite to call a geographic sphere in the country the "South-South," why are states in Nigeria's extreme north (Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina, Jigawa, Yobe, and Borno) not also designated as the "North-North"? For that matter, why don't they have "East-East" or "West-West"?

Origins of the phrase

The term "South-South" was invented by Nigeria's Second Republic Vice President Dr. Alex Ekeweme during the 1994-1995 National Constitution Conference. He used it to refer to Nigeria's Deep South. Nigerian newspaper journalists unquestioningly accepted and popularized it. The term isn't strictly a geographic category because "Southeastern" states like Imo and Abia are actually deeper down south than "South-South" states like Edo and northern Cross River. "South-South" is therefore no more than a clumsy attempt to create a geo-cultural and political space-- and identity--for ethnic minorities in the former Eastern Region, except that Edo and Delta states were never part of the Eastern Region; they were initially in the Western Region before a Mid-Western region was created for them. So the "South-South" was invented to encapsulate all people in Nigeria's South who don't self-identify as either Igbo or Yoruba.

"South-South" is now fossilized in the political lexicon of Nigerian English, and is used both as a noun (as in: "I come from the South-South") and as an adjective (as in: "South-South governors met yesterday"). But that is a nonstandard, peculiarly Nigerian usage. Here is why.

Why "South-South" should be discarded

In the English language there are four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west), four ordinal directions (northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest), and eight secondary inter-cardinal directions, (also called quadrantal points), which are hardly ever used. They are north-northeast, east-northeast, east-southeast, south-southeast, south-southwest, west-southwest, west-northwest, and north-northwest. North-central and south-central are also commonly used directional terminologies, especially in the United States, even though they are not part of the cardinal, ordinal, or secondary inter-cardinal directions.

There is no directional name called "South-South" in the English language. Nigeria is the first and only country in the English-speaking world to invent and use it as a directional denomination.

But the problem with the Nigerian usage of "South-South" isn't merely that English speakers from other parts of the world don't recognize it as a directional point; it is also that the phrase is already a standard attributive phrase in international politics to refer to the friendly relations between Third World countries. It regularly appears in expressions like "South-South Cooperation," "South-South learning," "South-South migration," "South-South development," "South-South collaboration," "South-South trade," etc. (I can bet that many averagely educated Nigerians come across these phrases on the Internet and mistake them for the oddly named geo-cultural region in their country).

The phrase arose from the division of the world into the "global north" (which refers to the industrialized nations of Europe, America and East Asia) and the "global south" (which refers to the developing nations of Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and parts of Asia). So cooperation between people in the global south, say between Nigeria and Venezuela, is called "south-south cooperation."

Since 1978, the "Unit for South-South Cooperation" has been a well-established part of the bureaucracy of the United Nations. That means when people outside Nigeria hear or read the phrase "South-South," the first-- and only-- thing that comes to their mind is: cooperation between developing countries. So while the average Nigerian sees "South-South" and immediately thinks of his or her country's Deep South, non-Nigerians think of friendly relations between developing nations when they see the same phrase. That's what I mean when I said the Nigerian English usage of "South-South" impedes mutual intelligibility in international communication.

Lexical inventiveness is justified only when it fills a void. There is no linguistic void that the Nigerian usage of the term "South-South" fills. When you add this fact to the reality that "South-South" already has a nearly 40-year history as a term that means the friendly relations between countries in the global south, you know the Nigerian "South-South" isn't worth keeping. It belongs in the lexical wastebasket.

What needs to be done

If I were to advise Nigerian policy makers who want to institutionalize the six geo-political zones in the country, I would encourage them to change "South-South" to "South-Central" just for the sake of consistency. In any case, although "South-Central" isn't an ordinal, cardinal or secondary inter-cardinal direction, it is well-established in directional nomenclature in the United States and elsewhere. Plus, it's actually a fairly accurate label for Nigeria's Deep South. (Go to my website at www.farooqkperogi.com to compare the map of America's South Central states with the location of Nigeria's so-called South-South states on Nigeria's map. The similarities are striking).

But the label doesn't even have to be wholly cartographically accurate to be valid. After all, the division of the North into "Northwest," "North-central" and "Northeast" isn't faithful to the precise geographic locations of the states in the region. Kaduna, Kano, and Jigawa states are certainly not in the northwest by any stretch of cartographic imagination. Benue State is more accurately in the east than it is in north-central Nigeria. And most of Niger State and my part of Kwara State is geographically in the northwest. But the division of the North--and of the South--into so-called geopolitical zones was inspired more by geo-cultural considerations than by the mere location of states on the compass point. So I see no reason why the "South-South" can't be renamed "South Central."

Another option is to simply call the region the "South." In order to avoid confusion and to ensure consistency, the "South-west" and the "South-east" should simply be called the "West" and the "East." In any case, what is now the "South-west" used to be called the Western Region, and what we now know as the "South-east" used to be called the Eastern Region before state creation in 1967. Prefixing "south" to "west" and "east" isn't necessary since the South was never ruled as one administrative entity except during the early part of British colonial rule. The three regions in the north can retain their current names since, historically, they formed part of the defunct Northern Region. So Nigeria's six regions will be Northwest, Northeast, North-central, South, West, and East.

I would prefer anything to "South-South," but I also know people who can change this nonsensical label don't care and probably won't even read this.

Apr 07, 2014 (Premium Times/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- It took centuries before capitalism's survival and future growth depended on an increase of the standards of living among the general population. This was reflected in the living standards of the people in the capitalist West. They were dirt poor as recently as the 1930s. From the early 20th century, and until the 1990s, the world was immersed in a struggle between Capitalism and Socialism. While one of these systems, capitalism, serves the interests of the bourgeois, socialism, aims to serve the proletariat.

This can best be described in the following: "In bourgeois terms, it was a war between the Allies and Germany, in Bolshevik terms, it was a war between the Allied and German upper classes," - Yevgraf Zhivago, from Boris Pasternak's novel, Dr. Zhivago.

TD 
	

Unfortunately, a perversion of socialism, called Communism, and eventually, Stalinism, achieved prominence and eventually failed.

Today's piece is about economic systems, the World Bank and the IMF, and whether they have they helped Nigeria or not. The reason I chose this particular topic for today is because of our new economic standing as Africa's "biggest" economy.

The World Bank and IMF were created at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. Present at the conference were the 44 allies of World War II. The United States attended in its own right. Remember that the US was the only country which emerged from World War 2 richer than it was before the war. Britain, also a victor from WW2 attended in its own right. But being the owner of a lot of dominions, including Nigeria at the time, it represented those dominions. The main aims of the Bretton Woods Conference were to develop a post-war economic order that will survive the test of time. However, the discussions were dominated by both the US and Britain, represented by Harry White and John Keynes respectively.

Keynes was dead set against the idea of currency liquidity across national boundaries that thing which we call "globalisation". Both White and Keynes, were among the greatest economists ever, Keynesian theory is still the bedrock of most teachings till today. At this point, I must note that some of Keynes's ideas have been discarded. By the time of the Bretton Woods meeting, Keynes was a dying man. He died two years later in 1946.

With people such as Keynes and White, it is no surprise that the outcome of the negotiations heavily favoured, in economic terms, the Western Allies.

Both bodies, the World Bank and the IMF, have in the 70 years since, done their bit to preserve the world order as defined in 1944. Given their very structure, both bodies are very much beholden to the existing world order, and will fight to save it. After WW2, in the capitalist societies of Europe, there was a ready market to exploit. People, devastated by the war, were dirt poor and had not much choice but to do what capitalist wanted in order to put bread on their tables. But the capitalists had their reasons, unlike in previous generations, for letting wealth be more equitably distributed. At the time, capitalist societies were engaged with the Stalinist Soviet Union in ideological warfare, so they needed to prove to the world that their system was better. Which is why living standards rose dramatically in the West post WW2.

This ended in the mid-1970s when growth stagnated, profits plummeted, and the social structures built after WW2 fell apart. To maintain the bubble of increasing prosperity, countries of the global south began to look more attractive as a source of cheap labour. Prior to that, the global south had always been a source of cheap resources, but their newly "independent status" was a threat to that mode of doing business.

Make no mistakes about it, the world has returned to the predatory laissez-faire capitalism that immiserated millions before the 20th century. This return began during the reigns of Ronald Regan in the US, and Meg Thatcher in the UK with regulations passed that unduly favoured capitalists and their businesses. Can someone explain to me, in real terms, what "deregulation" really is?

Since the world had started to change towards the tail end of the 1980s, and force, the preferred means of enforcing will had become a last resort, sponsoring a coup, as was done in Brazil and Chile in the 1960s and 1970s would no longer work as effectively as before. So, from the middle of the 1980s, a novel idea was developed, and that has been refined and perfected ever since. Debt bondage.

Debt bondage was initially pushed through via methods such as "structural adjustment", ergo Babangida in Nigeria, in the 1980s. But as awareness has increased among previously ignorant populations, it has become increasingly difficult to impose. So the new method, which I must admit, is proving quite effective, of imposing debt bondage, is to get the countries to impose "structural adjustment" on themselves.

Since the Reagan-Thatcher tango in the 1980s, the dominant world order, has been what is known as neoliberalism. But before we go on, what is Neoliberalism? It is both a political philosophy and an economic philosophy. It advocates support free trade and open markets, privatization, deregulation, and private sector dominance. And these buzzwords, are what make it rather easy to convince client countries to impose it on their populace.

So, how do you get client countries to go ahead & impose neoliberalism on themselves? That's where IMF and World Bank come in. Ukraine, for example is in trouble. Starting from Yushecko, then Tymoshenko, then Yanukovich, their leaders have been crooks. When you consider the fact that they have a huge neighbour that supplies almost all their energy needs, they need money. So, the IMF comes in, with the money, but with killer conditions, which in the long term will destroy the country, but will make a lot of people in the bourgeois stupendously rich. Oh, and a lot of people on the other side of the planet.

That's just one example. And that example involves the IMF. What about the World Bank? Since 2003, the World Bank has published the Ease of doing business Index which ranks countries based on the "ease of doing business" in them. This Index is now the World Bank's most influential publication and has driven 25% of all economic policy changes since it started. It measures how easy it is to start a business in a country, deal with construction permits, get electricity, register property, get credit, protect investors, pay tax, trade across borders, enforce contracts and resolve insolvency in various countries

It is on these 10 subsets that the index ostensibly relies, but the question is "how" does it rely on them?

The "pay tax" indicator as an example, punishes countries for having all sorts of tax, which to be honest are the best way governments to raise money. This will in a roundabout way, encourage more countries to become aberrations like Nigeria, where the government does not depend on the people for income. In my view, tax is needed to be government's main source of income, so it will force the issue of accountability. Since this "pay tax" indicator became a part of the Index, more countries have become tax havens, making it easier for the elite to hide money.

The "protect investors" indicator, ostensibly means to protect people who put their money in your economy. But it does nothing to prevent them from making money from your economy, and leaving you high and dry. Hence, most of the "foreign investment" that comes to Nigeria as an example since we started taking part in the jamborees simply stops in one location: Our stock market. Once they make a profit, or once there is a sign of trouble, they carry their money and go. Simply put, we are not attracting the right kind of foreign investment, we are attracting "fly-by-night investors" who are not here for the long term.

The "get credit" indicator sounds good on paper. As an entrepreneur of sorts, I can tell you that it's best to use credit for business. But this indicator in reality rewards countries that make it easier to liquidate defaulters and punishes countries that try to protect people who have gone bankrupt. It also rewards countries that publishes more information about their citizens' credit histories. A fine way to make people more subservient since all their time will be spent trying to stay financially solvent.

The "trade across borders" indicator punishes countries which try to protect their growing markets. This is why as good a policy as trying to protect our farmers may be, it will always be met with resistance because we are being protectionist. Witness how the rice wars in Ghana are still being fought, with the Ghanaians losing (http://bit.ly/1fXKo5E)

It is always interesting to see how we, the South, are expected to take all IMF recommendations, hook, line, sinker and hand. But countries of the North are free to reject those they feel like rejecting, and no, when I say north, I don't mean Greece. As an example, in April 2012, the IMF warned George Osborne that he was "playing with fire" when the UK rejected its recommendations. Only the same IMF, six months later, to tone down its rhetoric, and double its growth forecast for the UK to 1.4%. UK growth rates in fact went up to 1.9%, which serves as a lesson to banana republics such as Nigeria.

For our country to grow, we MUST always try and work in the interest of their own population, and take our own circumstance into consideration.

So are "free trade", "open markets", "deregulation" the best ways to go for a developing economy such as Nigeria?

For me, the answer to that is a resounding "NO". Nigeria needs something between a Scandinavian style welfare state, and FDR's America.

The neoliberalist policies pursued by the World Bank and IMF, by default need markets to exploit, so their policies WILL ALWAYS try to keep us down. The extent to which capitalism is capable of maintaining constant rates of growth remains highly debatable. Bottom line, is if we in the global south ever become truly independent, for the corporations of the global north, there will be no more worlds left to exploit.

Mar 28, 2014 (Friends of the Earth/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- La Via Campesina, Friends of the Earth International, Focus on the Global South, World Rainforest Movement and more than 120 organizations from around the world sent a letter to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO, in Rome, on the occasion of March 21st, the UN International Day of Forest.

The letter demands that the FAO change its present definition of forests. During the coming three months, groups will also present the demand to national and regional FAO offices.

TD 
	

Isaac Rojas, coordinator for forests and biodiversity of Friends of the Earth International notes that "FAO's forest definition needs to reflect the cultural wealth that forests represent. The present definition only helps to hide this diversity, rather strengthening a set of false solutions and privatization trends, as well as activities that create negative impacts in the communities that depend on forests".

For these people who depend on forests, non-timber forest products like fruits, seeds and medicinal plants have a huge importance, as well as fishing, hunting and also agriculture.

"Peasants in forest areas traditionally practice agriculture based on knowledge transmitted over many generations, conserving, not destroying forests.

Forests are fundamental for peasants to guarantee their food sovereignty.

We oppose the increasing commodification of natural resources like forests, pushed by TNCs and mechanisms like REDD.

Forests are crucial to maintain the ecosystem and therefore the farmers' livelihoods", explains Henry Saragih from the largest global peasant organization La Via Campesina.

One of the most perverse aspects of the present FAO forest definition is the fact that it includes industrial tree monocultures.

According to Teresa Perez of the World Rainforest Movement, "these large-scale industrial tree plantations have expanded four times in the past 20 years in the global South and now account for tens of millions of hectares.

The result has been deforestation and many other negative impacts for indigenous, other traditional and peasant populations like loss of territory, water and biodiversity".

Shalmali Guttal from Focus on the Global South adds that "the present FAO definition benefits first and foremost corporate interests, especially the tree plantation and timber industries. These companies - national and transnational--exacerbate and often drive land and resource grabbing over territories of communities across the global South".

It is shameful that the FAO and other international institutions associated with forest conservation continue to perpetuate this charade.

The letter concludes with the appeal to FAO to reflect in its definition what makes a forest a forest for the communities who depend on them: "In contrast to the existing process within FAO, a process of elaborating a new and more appropriate definition of forests must effectively engage those women and men who directly depend on forests.

An appropriate forest definition must support their modes of living, their networks and organizations. On the International Day of Forests we commit to continue the campaign to move the FAO and all concerned institutions to initiate a process led by forest communities to formulate a new definition of forest."

Nairobi, Nov 02, 2013 (United Nations Environment Program/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- We also have concrete outcomes with at least 16 agreements having being signed worth some $450 million in terms of funding cooperation and support for inclusive green economy initiatives.

H.E. Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary of Devolution and Planning of Government of Kenya;

H.E. Mariyam Shakeela, Minister of Environment and Energy and Acting Foreign Minister of Maldives;

Director of the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, Mr. Yiping Zhou;

Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, UNCTAD Secretary-General;

Ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you for taking part in this landmark Expo here in Kenya, here in the global south.

This week here in Nairobi the world has held a mirror to the future-an inclusive Green Economy mirror that has reflected the hopes and the aspirations of over seven billion people.

The world is searching for answers to the global development challenges of providing employment, providing energy, growing sufficient food and eradicating poverty, but in ways that keep humanity's footprint within planetary boundaries.

The 800 delegates who have attended this week's Expo, drawn from countries such as Argentina, China, Kenya, Japan, Iraq and Slovakia-along with some 50 exhibitors-have illuminated the pathways towards a low carbon, resource efficient future.

They are living and breathing examples that underline not just the theory but the practice of 'Building Inclusive Green Economies'

And here I would like to thank the United Arab Emirates for agreeing to host an important conference next March in order to further the Partnership for Action for a Green Economy (PAGE) with UNEP and our partners-the International Labour Organization, UNITAR and the UN Industrial and Development Organization.

I am sure you will agree that this week has been rich in issues and solutions with the 15 Partnership Forums covering topics ranging from sustainable oceans, information and communications technology for Least Developed Countries to non-motorized transport in the urban environment and citizen-based South-South cooperation.

We also have concrete outcomes with at least 16 agreements having being signed worth some $450 million in terms of funding cooperation and support for inclusive green economy initiatives.

For example at the conclusion of the Chief Executive Officers Tanzania's Africa Community Development Corporation Ltd signed an investment agreement worth $21 million that will finance the building and operation of an 8MW hydropower plant in Tanzania.

Many more ideas have been exchanged and seeds planted, and no doubt we will see further cooperation emerge as this seeds grow.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

As we leave today to return to our respective countries, we are far better placed to engineer and lead the debate on the post 2015 development agenda.

The kinds of partnerships forged here are building blocks towards the kind of broader and more inclusive partnerships that can be the bridge between the Millennium Development Goals and the planned Sustainable Development Goals.

Partnerships that put human capital, natural capital and clean technologies at the centre of sustainability now and into the coming decades.

As the rich dialogues and wealth of initiatives showcased this week demonstrate, South-South Cooperation is playing an increasingly tranformaive role in facilitating this global transition. These local, national and regional efforts are overcoming barriers, creating new finance mechanisms, generating knowledge, sharing information, providing training and delivering capacity building - in areas and sectors that are critical for a global transition to a low carbon, resource efficient and inclusive economy.

UNEP has been proud to have hosted you here in Nairobi this week-you have provided this institution with the confidence and the creativity that will strengthen our work and our resolve to go further and faster.

Rio+20 agreed that an inclusive green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication is an 'important tool' for achieving sustainable development when supported by policies that encourage decent employment, social welfare and inclusion and the maintenance of the Earth's ecosystems from forests to freshwaters.

This week's Expo underlines that the outcomes of Rio+20 are rapidly moving from words into actions not just in a few countries or pockets of communities, but across the globe.

And that the kind of supportive policies needed to accelerate and to scale-up this 'important tool' are being tried, tested and are indeed flourishing across the global South.

Thank you.

Nairobi, Nov 01, 2013 (United Nations Environment Program/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- More than $450 million was pledged between investors, green businesses, governments and other parties at the 2013 Global South-South Development Expo as hundreds of participants exchanged Southern-grown ideas, solutions and technologies throughout the week-long event.

High-level delegates from 150 countries and across the United Nations system gathered at the headquarters of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi to tackle development challenges by harnessing and exchanging innovative solutions developed in the global South.

TD 
	

Among the many agreements made this week were projects ranging from building organic fertilizer factories and clean energy projects in Kenya to solar power plants in Uganda to green businesses for women in Egypt.

Organized by the UN Office of South-South Cooperation and hosted by UNEP under the theme "Building inclusive green economies", the Global South-South Development Expo is the world's biggest stage for development solutions created in the South for the South.

"The theme of this year's Expo is fitting in that Southern countries have both the opportunity and the obligation to pursue a 'smarter' development course than their predecessors," said General Assembly President John Ashe.

South-South cooperation is the exchange of resources, technology and knowledge between developing countries. Today, over US$5 trillion in reserves are held by countries of the global South, which now also account for 47 per cent of global trade.

This unparalleled economic development opportunity could be one of the main engines of growth in the years ahead.

"As so many stories that we have heard this week demonstrate, South-South Cooperation is playing a vital role in facilitating this global transition," said UN Under-Secretary-General and UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner.

"Not only are these local, national and regional efforts producing positive results, but they are overcoming barriers, building new partnerships, creating new finance mechanisms, generating knowledge, sharing information, providing training and capacity building-in areas and sectors that are critical for a global transition to a low carbon, resource efficient and inclusive economy," he added.

Other high level participants throughout the Expo included former President of Tanzania Benjamin Mkapa; Minister of Environment and Energy and Acting Foreign Minister, Maldives, Mariyam Shakeela; Vice-Minister of Environmental Protection of China Wu Xiaoqing; Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD Erik Solheim; UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson; UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi; Under Secretary-General-General and High Representative for the UN Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States Gyan Chandra Acharya; Director of the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation Yiping Zhou; and representatives of more than 25 UN agencies, funds and programmes.

"You set out this week to share best practice experiences to impact the plight of the poor and improve livelihoods. And you have delivered," said Mr. Zhou.

More than 40 companies were successfully matched and held business negotiations at the Expo's South-South Global Assets and Technology Exchange (SS-GATE) event. Some 148 companies listed their projects on the SS-GATE web-platform.

At the Expo's CEO Round Table-which was attended by 21 CEOs and by Dr. Evans Kidero, Governor of Nairobi County-the Community Development Corporation Ltd., a private company based in Tanzania, and Viability Africa, LLC., based in Kenya, signed an agreement worth $21 million to build a hydropower plant in Tanzania.

A high-level Leadership Round Table brought together senior UN officials, Member States, business and corporate sector representatives to share their experiences of South-South cooperation.

Moderated by CNN journalist Zain Verjee, the event focused on green economy initiatives that have improved the Gross Domestic Product of the poor, as well as the quantity and quality of jobs, in different parts of the world. Participants also explored the role that South-South cooperation will play in the years beyond 2015.

The Expo's first Solution Exchange Forum was held under the theme "Building Inclusive Green Economies: Policy Drivers and Best Practices from South-South Cooperation". It presented examples of innovative projects in developing countries that are already contributing tangible benefits to the environment, economic development and decent job creation.

A total of 15 Partnership Forums were also held, with topics ranging from youth volunteerism to China-Africa business in support of green growth. More than 50 exhibitors showcased their innovative Southern-grown solutions in the Expo's eco-friendly pavilion.

For the first time in its history, the Expo garnered a strong online presence with the help of volunteers who collaborated remotely around the world on social media. The event was so popular that it trended on Twitter in Kenya, meaning that the message of the value and growing scope of South-South cooperation reached the next generation of development practitioners, entrepreneurs, environmentalists, thinkers and leaders.

Among other outcomes of the Expo were several major announcements by governments. At the UN Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE) Forum, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) pledged to host the first global PAGE conference in March 2014 in Dubai. The PAGE partnership, launched earlier this year, assists participating countries in shifting investment and policies towards clean technology, more resource-efficient infrastructure and sustainable natural resource management.

In addition, the annual South-South Cooperation Awards were presented at the Expo's Closing Ceremony to individuals and organizations that have been prominent champions of South-South cooperation throughout the world.

Nov 01, 2013 (United Nations Environment Program/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- South-South Development Expo Nairobi, Kenya

Honourable Ministers,

TD 
	

Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good morning.

I am truly pleased to be here with you for this closing ceremony. Until this past September, I had the honour of serving as the President of the High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation, and so this Global South-South Development Expo has a certain resonance for me.

Let me begin by acknowledging the many participants to this Expo and the host of creative ideas. This Expo brought together over 1,200 people from more than 150 Member States, as well as partners from the 29 UN System entities, and more than 100 private sector, civil society and academic organizations. You have showcased a wide array of tested green economy initiatives over the course of this week. Your success stories and your innovations are paving the way to prosperity for all by tackling shared challenges and making sustainable development an accepted and realistic norm.

I would also like to thank the Executive Director of UNEP, Mr. Achim Steiner and his organization for graciously hosting this year's Expo here at the United Nations Office in Nairobi. And I remain forever grateful to Mr. Yiping Zhou and the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC), for their vision and dedication in driving the South-South agenda forward through this annual event.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Developing countries continue to grow in wealth and savings. They now hold more than $5 trillion in reserves. Between 1980 and 2010, these countries increased their share of world trade from about 25% to 47%, with half of that trade taking place among countries of the South. It is therefore evident that South-South cooperation is having great impact and influence across a range of sectors including health, energy, economic and trade. It is also worthy to note that the South is attracting significant capital inflows, and that some of the emerging economies of the South are beginning to exercise tremendous geopolitical influence. The fact that this Expo is being convened in the Global South for the first time is testimony to the growing importance of the South.

As never before, Southern countries are supporting one another through investment, technology transfer, and peer-to-peer learning. South-South and regional groups are meeting at the highest levels, consolidating their influence and impacting the global discourse. They are also strengthening and redesigning approaches to development. In part, these new configurations and partnerships are guiding the way to a new era in development and global economics.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

With each passing year, it becomes more and more commonplace to say that eradicating extreme poverty is now an achievable reality - that in the not too distant future, we will no longer need to count the number of people living on less than $1 or $2 per day. Many are now convinced that this noble goal is within our grasp, and in large part, this is because of the growing might of the Southern countries and the efforts of their people. Yet the challenge remains to put in place the policies, programmes and measures to make poverty eradication a reality by creating more cross-sectoral synergies.

The theme of this year's Expo - Building Inclusive Green Economies: South-South Cooperation for Sustainable Development, invites us to recognise and act on the fact that society, economy and environment are inextricably linked, and that each derives benefit from or causes harm to the other. It also highlights the concept that ecology and economy are not two competing and mutually exclusive paradigms, but that they can in fact be harmoniously managed in a mutually advantageous way for the benefit of companies, citizens, communities and countries. Trade, with appropriate mechanisms that ensure open markets and allow for fair competition, can bring much value added to societies. These are the underpinning tenets of the green economy ? the protection of planet and people while ensuring prosperity that is sustainable.

On the basis of this definition, there are some critical steps to be taken in the creation of a global green economy. I start with the building of new and strong trading relationships in which new green goods and services will play a pivotal role. From earliest times, trade was central to social and economic growth and it will be equally important in the green economy as it has been in the brown economy.

Second, governments will need to embrace business as partners in the creation of decent jobs, wealth, and development. It is governments that must create the enabling environment through legal, fiscal, governance and regulatory frameworks so that the business sector can innovate and successfully transition to a green economy.

Third, the business sector must step up to the role of greening operations and practices, and act with a higher level of social and environmental entrepreneurship; just as they did with the knowledge economy and technology sectors, they must innovate new products that improve quality of life and transform markets in order to facilitate a viable and vibrant global green economy.

Fourth, the business sector must recognise that when the natural resource base is protected, it enables a lowering of the bottom line and an increase in profits, as well as positive brand recognition.

Fifth, societies in which there is greater wealth and disposable income are those in which citizens spend more, thereby increasing economic activity. Since people, planet and profit are interconnected, ideas such as social entrepreneurship, social corporate responsibility, introducing green matrices into business models and the valuation of human and social capital actually bring a high return on investment. Hence the role business plays in protecting people and planet is one of enlightened self-interest, which yields high returns.

The sixth step really comes back to governments and connects with our role at the UN. Ultimately, it falls to governments, acting nationally, regionally and internationally, to evolve and implement policies that ensure citizens benefit from national wealth, that social services are strong and function well and that the revenues derived from strong and successful businesses and taxation are ploughed back into the development field in the form of social service, health care for all, proper education for girls and women, as well as boys and men, good housing and lives of dignity. That is what development is all about. That is what I think you have eluded to in the title of this Expo and for that I commend you. If the South can develop a model of the green economy that has a uniquely southern DNA, which grows economies while protecting the planet and ensuring the wellbeing of its people, then it would be well on the way to unprecedented growth and sustainable development and to becoming world leaders with new models of development

Ladies and Gentlemen,

At the Rio+20 Conference, Heads of States and Governments stressed the interconnectedness between the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainable development.

During the High-level week of the General Assembly this year, Member States committed to an outcome document that marks the next step in our development efforts as a global community. This document makes a strong call for a final push to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Despite our aspirations, we have hard work ahead of us.

Here, Southern countries, with a common understanding of shared development challenges, can be their own best allies.

The outcome document adopted in September also set us firmly on course to adopt a new development agenda - one with a broadened view that will apply to all countries, albeit with different responsibilities. In this regard, the theme of this year's Expo - Building Inclusive Green Economies: South-South Cooperation for Sustainable Development ? is fitting in that Southern countries have both the opportunity and obligation to pursue a "smarter" development course than their predecessors. It is an "opportunity" because smarter development can yield better and more lasting results, and it is an "obligation" because this planet and its people sorely need this change in direction.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

At the Opening Session of this Expo on Monday, Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson called on all of us to "work together to capitalize on Southern successes," and urged us to: "build bridges, establish partnerships, encourage innovation, and establish sustainable strategies for scaling up impact together."

The concrete solutions we have seen over the last few days illustrate how we are adding tangible effort to what we are saying on the issues. From the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency to the limitation of pollutant emissions, from sustainable farming and forestry practices to water conservation, these initiatives demonstrate that the protection of the environment is not only a moral imperative, it is also an economic imperative.

With that in mind, let me please take a moment to congratulate some of your successes this week:

You exhibited more than 70 best practices.

You showcased dozens of tested solutions. .

SS-GATE enabled Southern CEOs to launch a multi-million dollar South-South partnership agreement to produce hydropower in Tanzania and it facilitated the matching of over 100 solution-seekers with Southern providers. .

The South-South Energy Initiative, led by Ghana, was launched to leverage Southern know-how as a means to help new oil and gas producing countries avoid the pitfalls of the past. .

We saw the inauguration of the South-South Technology Transfer Facility for the Landlocked Developing Countries, which is designed to strengthen their productive capacity and production to benefit of those most in need. .

We heard the announcement of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation-UN joint initiative to raise 20 million dollars to train Somali women, nurses and entrepreneurs; and.

The 2013 GSSD Expo Carbon Offsetting Initiative was put forth to ensure that the carbon footprint of this Expo is offset.

Distinguished Delegates,

In Rio, in the General Assembly and in other international forums, member States have increasingly recognised the strategic significance of South-South cooperation in the United Nations system. To continue on this path and to deepen our discussions on how to continue improving South-South cooperation, I will convene a High-level Event on South-South, Triangular Cooperation and ICT for Development in the Post-2015 Development Agenda. I am confident that the solutions you showcased here, the innovative partnerships you formed, and the multi-partnered, multi-agency initiatives you launched at this Expo will undoubtedly contribute to this process.

Let me conclude by echoing the Secretary-General's call for the entire United Nations system to "Think as one, act as one, and deliver as one" for development. What you have exhibited here at this Expo is what the SG called for and member States wanted. For that, I commend the work of the UNOSSC!

I look forward to seeing many of you in New York as we chart our way to a promising new era in global development. And I thank each and every one of you, but especially you, Mr. Zhou, for opening our eyes to fresh and exciting ideas, as you do every year.

Thank you.

Nov 01, 2013 (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The 2013 global South-South development expo was opened in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Monday with UN Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson expecting emerging nations to contribute more to a peaceful and prosperous world.

"The global South has made tremendous progress in all aspects of human endeavor for the last decade. Developing countries are the new frontier for economic and technological progress that has impacted on the entire world," Eliasson said.

TD 
	

Since its launch in 2008, the expo has fostered fruitful cooperation in tackling global challenges including hunger, poverty, climate change and diseases.

The international community supports partnership among emerging nations to share experience and best practices that would catalyze sustainable development.

The conference brought together senior delegates from 150 countries and across the UN system to discuss development challenges by harnessing and exchanging innovative solutions developed in the global South.

According to the UN, over 5 trillion U. S. dollars in reserves are today held by countries of the South, which now also account for 47 percent of global trade. This unmatched economic development opportunity could be one of the main engines of growth in the years ahead.

Oct 31, 2013 (This Day/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Representatives from some 150 countries are currently gathered at the headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Kenya, to tackle development challenges and discuss ways to harness environmentally-friendly solutions developed in the global South.

During the five-day Global South-South Development Expo, which began on Monday, Oct 28, Government ministers, business leaders and experts will focus on this year's theme, 'Building inclusive green economies.'

TD 
	

"The transition to inclusive green economies is essential to the economic and social development of countries all over the world," said UNEP Executive Director, Achim Steiner. "However, no one nation, community or agency has all the answers.

"This is why so many inspirational initiatives have gathered at this Expo - a mirror to the collective creativity of nations, cities, companies and citizens - to galvanise action that will place the global South on the pathway to a sustainable, low-carbon, green future." During the Expo, which was organised by the UN Office of South-South Cooperation and hosted by UNEP, delegates would be able to attend and participate in forums and roundtables which seek to highlight successful South-south initiatives and experiences that are benefiting the environment, economic development and job creation. They would also explore the role that this type of collaboration would have in the years beyond 2015.

Other topics to be discussed in the 16 partnership forums include green growth, business between China and Africa, youth volunteerism and the role of oil and gas in the transition to a green economy.

South-south cooperation is the exchange of resources, technology and knowledge between developing countries. Today, over $5 trillion in reserves are held by countries of the global South, which now also account for 47 per cent of global trade.

"Solutions originating in the Global South are delivering results around the world," said Deputy-Secretary General Jan Eliasson.

Also in attendance was Vice-President of the High-Level Committee of the UN General Assembly on South-South Cooperation and Deputy Permanent Representative of Hungary to the UN Zsolt Hetesy. "This expo is a concrete expression of the partnerships we need for the path we seek," he said.

"Over the past three decades the Global South has witnessed unprecedented growth and expansion of incomes, bolstering of trade, lifting of hundreds of millions from poverty and emergence of a growing middle class," said Hetesy. "Much, in this unfolding phenomenon stems from a very noticeable surge in the practice and advancement of South-south cooperation by Member States, organisations of the United Nations system, other intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, and other stakeholders."

Oct 30, 2013 (UN News Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Representatives from some 150 countries today gathered at the headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Kenya, to tackle development challenges and discuss ways to harness environmentally-friendly solutions developed in the global South.

During the five-day Global South-South Development Expo, Government ministers, business leaders and experts will focus on this year's theme, 'Building inclusive green economies.'

TD 
	

"The transition to inclusive green economies is essential to the economic and social development of countries all over the world," said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. "However, no one nation, community or agency has all the answers.

"This is why so many inspirational initiatives have gathered at this Expo - a mirror to the collective creativity of nations, cities, companies and citizens - to galvanize action that will place the global South on the pathway to a sustainable, low-carbon, green future."

During the Expo, which was organized by the UN Office of South-South Cooperation and hosted by UNEP, delegates will be able to attend and participate in forums and roundtables which seek to highlight successful South-South initiatives and experiences that are benefiting the environment, economic development and job creation. They will also explore the role that this type of collaboration will have in the years beyond 2015.

Other topics to be discussed in the 16 partnership forums include green growth, business between China and Africa, youth volunteerism and the role of oil and gas in the transition to a green economy.

South-South cooperation is the exchange of resources, technology and knowledge between developing countries. Today, over $5 trillion in reserves are held by countries of the global South, which now also account for 47 per cent of global trade.

"Solutions originating in the Global South are delivering results around the world," said Deputy-Secretary General Jan Eliasson.

Also in attendance was Vice-President of the High-Level Committee of the UN General Assembly on South-South Cooperation and Deputy Permanent Representative of Hungary to the UN Zsolt Hetesy.

"This expo is a concrete expression of the partnerships we need for the path we seek," he said.

"Over the past three decades the Global South has witnessed unprecedented growth and expansion of incomes, bolstering of trade, lifting of hundreds of millions from poverty and emergence of a growing middle class," said Mr. Hetesy.

"Much, in this unfolding phenomenon stems from a very noticeable surge in the practice and advancement of South-South cooperation by Member States, organizations of the United Nations system, other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders."

Nairobi, Oct 29, 2013 (United Nations Environment Program/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Government Ministers, Business Leaders and Experts Spotlight Southern-Grown Solutions and Cooperation Opportunities Over US$5 Trillion in Reserves and 47 per cent of Global Trade Held by Countries of the Global South

Hundreds of high-level delegates from 150 countries and across the United Nations system gathered at the headquarters of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi on Monday to tackle development challenges by harnessing and exchanging innovative solutions developed in the global South.

TD 
	

South-South cooperation is the exchange of resources, technology and knowledge between developing countries. Today, over US$5 trillion in reserves are held by countries of the global South, which now also account for 47 per cent of global trade.

More about the Expo and its programme

This unparalleled economic development opportunity could be one of the main engines of growth in the years ahead.

Organized by the UN Office of South-South Cooperation and hosted by UNEP under the theme "Building inclusive green economies," the Global South-South Development Expo is the world's biggest stage for development solutions created in the South for the South.

"The transition to inclusive green economies is essential to the economic and social development of countries all over the world," said UN Under Secretary-General and UNEP Executive Director and Achim Steiner. "However, no one nation, community or agency has all the answers."

"This is why so many inspirational initiatives have gathered at this expo-a mirror to the collective creativity of nations, cities, companies and citizens-to galvanize action that will place the Global South on the pathway to a sustainable, low-carbon, green future," he added.

High level participants include former President of Tanzania Benjamin Mkapa, Vice-Minister of Environmental Protection of China Wu Xiaoqing, Vice-President of the High-Level Committee of the UN General Assembly on South-South Cooperation and Deputy Permanent Representative of Hungary to the UN Zsolt Hetesy, Ambassador of Brazil to Kenya and Permanent Representative to UNON, UNEP and UN-Habitat Marcela Maria Nicodemos, Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD Erik Solheim and UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson.

"Over the past three decades the Global South has witnessed unprecedented growth and expansion of incomes, bolstering of trade, lifting of hundreds of millions from poverty and emergence of a growing middle class," said Mr. Hetesy. "Much, in this unfolding phenomenon stems from a very noticeable surge in the practice and advancement of South-South cooperation by Member States, organizations of the United Nations system, other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders."

"Solutions originating in the Global South are delivering results around the world," said Mr. Eliasson. "This expo is a concrete expression of the partnerships we need for the path we seek."

"There are more common benefits shared among developing countries than differences, and this should push more strategic policy dialogue and pragmatic cooperation," said Mr. Xiaoqing. "We encourage traditional donor partners to actively participate in the South-South and take advantage of market power to attract the private sector and non-governmental organizations."

Events featured throughout the Expo's first day included a ribbon cutting to inaugurate the Expo's exhibition pavilion- a unique space housing over 70 individual exhibitors in interactive booths.

A high-level Leadership Round Table will bring together senior UN officials, Member States, business and corporate sector representatives to share their experiences of South-South cooperation.

Moderated by CNN journalist Zain Verjee, the event will focus on green economy initiatives that have improved the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the poor, as well as the quantity and quality of jobs, in different parts of the world. They will also explore the role that South-South cooperation will play in the years beyond 2015.

Events throughout the week will spotlight real-life examples of South-South Cooperation.

The Expo's first Solution Exchange Forum will be held under the theme, "Building Inclusive Green Economies: Policy Drivers and Best Practices from South-South Cooperation."

It will present examples of innovative projects in developing countries that are already contributing tangible benefits to the environment, economic development and decent job creation.

A total of 16 Partnership Forums will be held, with topics ranging from youth volunteerism to China-Africa business in support of green growth.

Over six energy ministers from Africa will meet during a partnership forum held in the context of the Expo that will spotlight the role that oil and gas can play in the transition to a green economy.

The forum will present success stories from Africa, where revenues from oil were used to invest in renewable energy and develop more sustainable energy sources.

Experts will also introduce the South-South Energy Initiative, a formalized mechanism and strategic hub for discussion on issues facing Southern energy producers.

Ministers of oil, petroleum or energy from Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, South Sudan and Uganda will engage in an interactive discussion during the forum.

Oct 29, 2013 (United Nations Environment Program/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The UNEP-hosted International Resource Panel estimates that natural resource use will triple by 2050 as the world's population rises to nine billion and burgeoning middle classes from emerging economies follow the well-worn pattern of consumption.

UN Deputy Secretary General, Mr. Jan. Eliasson;

TD 
	

Vice-President of the Bureau of the High-level Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on South-South Cooperation, H.E. Mr. Zsolt Hetesy, Deputy Permanent Representative of Hungary to the United Nations;

Director of the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, Mr. Yiping Zhou;

Mr. Erik Solheim, Chair, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Development Assistance Committee (DAC);

Mr. Aly Abou-Sabaa, Vice-President, Sector Operations II, African Development Bank (AfDB);

Mr. Fu Chengyu, CEO, China Petrochemical Corporation (SINOPEC);

Ms. Zain Verjee;

Ladies and Gentlemen.

The greatest challenge of today is how to grow economies and generate employment in a way that keeps humanity's footprint within planetary boundaries-in short, how to create a worldwide transition to inclusive Green Economies in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, as green lighted by world leaders at Rio+20.

There can be no denying that the global economy is currently on an unsustainable path. The UNEP-hosted International Resource Panel estimates that natural resource use will triple by 2050 as the world's population rises to nine billion and burgeoning middle classes from emerging economies follow the well-worn pattern of consumption.

The question facing the global community right now is how to turn aside from this path and decouple the growth that will lift billions out of poverty from unrestrained and unthinking resource use. In order to make this transformation, strong leadership will be required and I believe that this leadership is growing day-by-day across the globe-particularly in the Global South.

Given the challenges the world faces, this leadership comes not a moment too soon as governments begin to understand that the case for a transition to a global Green Economy has never been stronger.

UK consultancy Trucost recently launched a report on behalf of the TEEB for Business Coalition, of which the UNEP Finance Initiative is a member. It found that the top 100 environmental externalities are costing the global economy around US$4.7 trillion a year.

These externalities are linked to the economic costs of greenhouse gas emissions, loss of natural resources, loss of nature-based services such as carbon storage by forests, climate change and air pollution-related health costs.

Among the sectors with the highest impact in this regard are coal-burning power plants in East Asia and North America, with externalities totalling $453 billion and $317 billion, respectively-higher than the value of the electricity that they produce.

On the other hand, UNEP's Green Economy report, launched just before Rio+20, strongly made the case that the right kind of policy switches and environmental investments in key sectors can bring multiple benefits, such as:

A steady GDP growth rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent over the next four decade, with decreased risks associated with climate change, energy shocks, water scarcity, is eminently possible;

15 to 60 million additional jobs that would lift tens of millions out of poverty over the next two decades;

An overall decrease of humankind's ecological footprint by 48 per cent.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

These figures show without a doubt that integrating economic and environmental policy-by, for example, moving away from indicators such as GDP to indicators that include the value of natural capital and thus allow governments to factor in the economic damage of resource degradation-is the only way to create a more equitable and sustainable world.

Over the last few years, UNEP's Green Economy Initiative has assisted developing countries in the formulation and implementation of policy reforms and investments that catalyse transitions to just such a Green Economy integration.

What is so encouraging is that these countries have embarked on this journey freely and willingly, many of them joining the Partnership for Action on the Green Economy - a UN-system wide initiative involving UNEP aimed at providing by 2020 assistance to up to 30 developing countries to achieve their Green Economy aims.

I was in Mongolia in June this year for World Environment Day, and saw first-hand the commitment that is being demonstrated by so many developing nations. Only a few years ago, Mongolia was still firmly on the old unsustainable 'brown' path as a surge in mining sent the economy surging.

The Mongolian government, however, realized this could not continue. In recent times, it has established a Green Development Strategy, began creating legal frameworks that include pricing natural capital, instituted environmental safeguards on new mining concessions, put in place plans to boost the capacity of solar systems in Mongolian homes, and moved towards creating a network of extensive wind farms.

Or take our host Kenya, where green energy policies have led to investments in renewables that cover over 95 per cent of all new electricity-generating infrastructure.

And then there is Peru, where UNEP found in 2012 that national trade liberalization policies were associated with an expansion of market access for 228 private companies that export products drawn from local biodiversity. Facilitating and promoting trade in those products helped Peru to gain access to over 2.3 billion consumers in various key export markets.

These are all Southern-grown solutions, and demonstrate the expanding trend of strong and visionary leadership by the South, where the greatest impacts of phenomena such as climate change are so often felt.

And this, ultimately, is why so many inspirational leaders have gathered here in Nairobi this week to exchange experiences and solutions and add greater impetus to the South's transition to a Green Economy.

In this post-Rio+20 environment, and with the post-2015 sustainable development agenda still taking shape, UNEP is placing tremendous importance on South-South cooperation, as should the rest of the world: today, over US$5 trillion in reserves are held by countries of the global South, accounting for 47 per cent of global trade.

Many of the most inspiring solutions to environmental sustainability and sustainable development in the 21st century are emerging from the South, as the South-South Exchange mechanism shows.

For example, Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia have committed to conserving and sustainably managing the Heart of Borneo- 220,000km2 of tropical forest on the island of Borneo and one of Asia's last great rainforests-which is home to the threatened orangutan, pygmy elephant, clouded leopard, and the critically endangered Sumatran rhino.

There any many further examples on the exchange mechanism website, and I fully expect to see many more showcased at the expo this week.

This expo is an outstanding opportunity for nations to come together, learn from each other, and harness Southern-grown development solutions that address both existing and emerging development challenges head-on.

Thank you.

Nairobi, Oct 28, 2013 (United Nations Environment Program/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Together with the Partnership for Action for the Green Economy, we are collaborating with UNITAR, UNIDO and the ILO, to assist 30 developing economies to meet their ambition to become low-carbon, resource-efficient and significant job generating countries by 2020.

Vice-President of the Bureau of the High-level Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on South-South Cooperation, H.E. Mr. Zsolt Hetesy, Deputy Permanent Representative of Hungary to the United Nations;

Director of the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, Mr. Yiping Zhou;

Ladies and gentlemen.

Welcome to Nairobi for the Global South South Development Expo 2013.

Welcome to a location that in many ways symbolizes the spirit, the aims and the opportunities of South-South cooperation.

For here, unique in the developing world two, are two UN headquarters-UNEP, the organization I represent, and UN-HABITAT, headed by my colleague Joan Clos.

Two organizations that foster cooperation not just between the nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America, but also between the global south and the global north.

The theme this week is Building Inclusive Green Economies: a concept which emerged from the The Future We Want outcome of the Rio+20 Summit of 2012.

UNEP launched its green economy work in 2008. Together with the Partnership for Action for the Green Economy, we are collaborating with UNITAR, UNIDO and the ILO, to assist 30 developing economies to meet their ambition to become low-carbon, resource-efficient and significant job generating countries by 2020.

To help to reach that goal, UNEP has combed the planet for inspiring, scalable and transformative initiatives.

And it will surprise few here today that much of this expertise is in the developing world-from the dramatic expansion of geothermal electricity here in Kenya's Rift Valley to Brazil's remarkable reductions in deforestation to renewable energy in China and organic farming in Uganda.

Fortunately, you do not need to travel the globe to learn about these solutions and how to replicate them-we have them, and many others, here as part of the Expo.

And we are proud to also have many of the people who have championed the policies and the technologies that have turned ideas into reality on the ground.

If seven billion people are to thrive, we need to build inclusive green economies.

On show this week are the foundations upon which each and every one of us can build.

And here I would like to thank the Government of China and others for their support for this event.

Ladies and gentlemen,

No one nation and no one community has the all the answers-which why the South-South Development Expo is so important as a mirror to the collective creativity of nations, cities, companies and citizens.

I hope you will enjoy the Expo and be inspired by the innovations on display.

UNEP along with the United Nations Office at Nairobi, is proud to be your host and to open our doors to a promising present and an even more extraordinary future.

Thank you

Sep 11, 2013 (GEGAfrica/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- After years of stellar growth, the BRICS have plunged into economic turmoil. Not a single week passes without more bad news from emerging markets in the Global South. The Chinese economy is growing at the lowest figures in years, and Brazil, India and South Africa are barely growing faster than the US economy this year.

TD 
	

The political effects of this development are already palpable on a global scale. Disappointing growth in the emerging world has lowered the pressure on the United States and Europe to reform international institutions and increase the representation of countries like Brazil and India. U.S. Congress has still not ratified the historic 2010 IMF quota reforms, and some observers suggest it may not be voted on this year. A growing number of policy makers and commentators in the United States and Europe feel as if they have finally awoken from a bad, decade-long dream. Now, thankfully, things seem to be back to normal. Easy money from the Federal Reserve Bank is about to dry up, and China will increasingly focus on boosting domestic consumption. As a consequence, the BRICS will suffer. The 'rise of the rest' has proved to be unsustainable. The world's key institutions can maintain their Western-centric design.

Such rhetoric paints the rise of the Global South as a phenomenon essentially dependent on easy Western money and Chinese imports, and emerging powers as helpless actors who happened to stumble into an unexpected and undeserved decade of growth.

Yet low economic growth in the Global South cannot do away the historic advances emerging powers have made, especially during the past decade, which has seen an unprecedented degree of emancipation of the Global South - including the African continent. The lull in the emerging world does not alter long-term predictions that China will overtake the U.S. American economy. Despite current problems, India is set to become a major pillar of the world economy in the course of this century. The world economy will not return to the distribution of power of the late 20th century.

As Zachary Karabell argues,

Sentiment may have shifted dramatically in the past few months, but there is a substantial difference between that and structural collapse and crisis. Yes, emerging world economies are seeing slowing growth relative to the heightened rates of recent years, and yes, the shift to domestic demand-driven economic activity is not easy. But that is not the same as re-writing the script of the past decade and turning the achievements of many of these countries into a mirage.

When it comes time to write the story of the first years of the 21st century, the global narrative will not only be the struggles of the United States to adjust to a world of diffuse power, or the rise of China and the decline of Europe. It will be the way that substantial portions of the planet emerged from agrarian poverty into the early stages of urban affluence. It will be the way the Internet and the mobile revolution anchored by the rise of China began to reshape the vast regions of sub-Saharan Africa; how India's middle classes started to redefine that country, and how millions in Latin America sloughed off decades of authoritarian incompetence and began to blossom. Never in human history have more people become more affluent more quickly than in the opening years of the 21st century.

As a consequence, the fundamental logic of the need to reform global governance structures remains sound. For policy makers in Europe and the United States, engaging emerging powers is the only way of assuring that international institutions remain functional once the traditional powers are no longer in control. The difficult process of adapting to a new reality has just begun. In the coming years and decades, far more extensive reforms - in the World Bank, the IMF and the United Nations Security Council - will have to be implemented if these institutions are to maintain their legitimacy in the twenty-first century.

HD 	The Marriage Trap - the Pleasures and Perils of Same-Sex Equality [guest blog]

Jul 29, 2013 (Institute of Development Studies/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- As legislative battles for same-sex equality have rumbled on in western countries over the last fifteen years, each successive victory has concentrated attention increasingly upon gay marriage as the lodestone issue around which everything else orbits.

This narrow focus is becoming increasingly problematic for sexual rights movements in the Global South and for those of us concerned with gender and sexual plurality within the UK.

TD 
	

Significantly, those working to rid the statute books of discrimination are increasingly crossing party-political borders. Current Conservative British Prime Minister, David Cameron, facilitated last week's attainment of legalised UK same-sex civil marriage.

The British Government are not outliers in this regard - in the teeth of unexpectedly robust opposition, France also legalised gay marriage in the last couple of months, and the US Supreme Court successfully ruled against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), opening up space for state by state marriage equality to blossom.

Political discourse around homosexuality has been transformed irrevocably in the West and is prized increasingly as a signifier of modernity amongst politicians.

The passing of this Bill hasn't stymied scepticism around Cameron's motives by equality activists, bloggers and in the Twitter-sphere. Yet in fairness to him, Cameron has invested more political capital in this issue than he needed or could afford.

Alongside the continuing antagonism towards European Union membership, gay marriage has become a significant rupture point between him, his backbenchers and party activists. I'd argue, however, that supporting gay marriage could prove in the longer term to be an astute call for social conservatives in sidelining the radical edge of sexual minorities.

On a personal note, I have mixed feelings about last week's news. Whilst dismantling inequitable laws that discriminate against same-sex individuals is always laudable and something I've personally championed in my own activism, there is a nagging feeling that alongside the positive and affirming evolution this will bring to wider society's acceptance of homosexuality, gay marriage could succeed in closing down debate about alternative relationship models and family structures, already struggling to gain acceptance and airtime.

Folding same-sex monogamous marriage into a state-sanctioned model that provides institutional clout, tax breaks and economic advantages could serve to homogenize groups that have traditionally represented a challenge to established thinking around the family.

The political struggles of the LGBT movement have always been grounded in an existential challenge to gender essentialism and a heteronormativity that suffocates heterosexual people just as completely as queer folk.

Twenty years ago, our opponents attacked us for our promiscuity, now they oppose us for aspiring to a relationship model that has become increasingly problematic.

Alongside the growth of individualism, consumerism and globalization, an interchangeable western gay identity 'The Gay International' is taking root that is squeezing out the economically disadvantaged, ossifying gender behaviours and invisibilising alternative models of sexual-ness from the Global South.

Similarly, Cameron's off the cuff comments in the last few days about 'exporting the bill team' who worked to help pass the legislation into law has already drawn the British Government into another round of conflict with southern sexual rights activists, who are already seeing the first signs of a renewed media and political backlash in their home countries against perceived western imperialist intervention.

In truth, Cameron was talking about supporting those states going down the same route as the UK rather than opponents of homosexual equality, but his poor memory over his similarly misjudged comments around aid conditionality two years ago points to him playing to the domestic audience at the expense of those at the sharp end of homophobic injustice.

Worryingly, I'm keenly aware that this stance can resonate with even the most progressive LGBT people in the UK, hearing weekly reports of violence and oppression in countries such as Russia, Uganda and Malawi.

Those of us fighting for more nuanced political strategies around global sexual rights need to urgently examine how we can both hold the UK Government's feet to the fire on these issues, but also influence the expectations and strategies demanded by ordinary constituents to reflect the needs and priorities of our partners in the Global South.

So, as the dust settles and same-sex couples begin celebrating their first marriages, we must not lose sight of the less helpful political implications to arise from same-sex marriage.

Are sexual minorities becoming incorporated into a new moral straitjacket? How do we retain spaces within and without political discourse for the protection of sexual freedom, such as polyamory?

Are political parties and LGBT organisations becoming imbedded in hegemonic privilege and identity politics, divorced from the marginalised, poorer voices of sexual minorities and their very material concerns? Marriage equality isn't the end of the road for the gay rights movement, but the start of a much more complicated conversation.

Apr 25, 2013 (The Daily Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Global Human Development Report 2013 was Wednesday officially launched by the vice president and minister of Women's Affairs, Her Excellency Dr Aja Isatou Njie-Saidy, at a ceremony held at the Kairaba Beach Hotel in Kololi.

The 2013 report entitled; The Rise of the South; Human Progress in a Diverse World', ranked Norway at the top, The Gambia at no.165 whilst Niger, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mozambique are ranked at the bottom.

TD 
	

The report celebrates 23 years of human development by reviewing the concepts of human development, how it is measured and its policies, in order to get a better insight about the progress made and how it can help chart a course for people-centered development. It is also about enabling people to exercise individual choice, as well as to participate and benefit from processes at the household, community and national levels to be empowered.

In her launching statement, VP Njie-Saidy described the topic and the main theme for this year's report as not only timely but relevant to the current plight of many in the developing world, particularly in view of the emerging changes and reshaping trends of the global development being witnessed in many developing countries.

"Suffice to say this report contributes immensely to the body of knowledge and will enlighten us in the South on what we can do for ourselves rather than looking forward to the North for solutions to our human development challenges. The report consists of five chapters namely; the state of human development, a more global south, and drivers of development transformation, sustaining momentum and governance and partnerships for a new era," she said.

The report, according to VP Njie-Saidy, examines the profound shift in global dynamics driven by the fast rising power of the developing world as well as give explanation for its implication for human development.

She further remarked that it also looks at the evolving geopolitics of our times, explored emerging issues and trends and new actors which are shaping the development landscape.

The vice president informed the gathering that the report also contains useful statistics annexes that are helpful for regional and country comparison in terms of human progress attained. She noted that the 2013 HDR argues that the striking transformation of a large number of developing countries into dynamic major economies with growing political influence is having a significant impact on human development.

She continued: "It's gratifying to note that the report highlighted achievements in education, health and income dimensions as measured in the human development index by all countries over the last decade. In fact a faster progress was recorded in lower HDI countries during this period which clearly shows that low income countries are getting better, and growing at a faster rate than the developed world."

The 2013 HDR, VP Njie-Saidy pointed out, also identifies four specific areas of focus sustaining development momentum; i.e. enhancing equity, including gender dimension; enabling greater voice and participation of citizens, including youth; confronting environmental pressure; and managing demographic change. She said that a key message drawn from earlier Human Development Reports showed that economic growth alone does not automatically translate into human development progress.

VP Njie-Saidy explained that the HDR highlights critical areas in the state of human development; i.e. progress of nations, social integration, and human security adding that in the more global South chapter, the focus is on rebalancing a more global world and a more global South; impetus from human development, innovation and entrepreneurship in the south; new forms of cooperation and sustaining progress in uncertain times.

She also emphasised that the government under the able leadership of His Excellency Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr. Yahya Jammeh is invigorating its efforts at achieving a middle income country status as enshrined in the country's Vision 2020 strategic document.

"The government has continuously developed medium-term development strategies which consistently pursued the overall objective of eradicating human poverty and suffering. The PAGE which is a successor to PRSP I & II, aims to consolidate and expand on the gains in economic prosperity and generate decent employment and income for the citizenry," she added.

Speaking earlier, the UNDP resident representative, Izumi Motota-Alakija, on behalf of UNDP The Gambia Office, thanked the participants for their presence at the launching of the report. She also expressed sincere gratitude to the vice president for her continued support to the UNDP and its activities in the country.

Her words: "On the 14 March 2013 UNDP Administrator Helen Clark and President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto launched the 2013 human development report "The Rise of the South" in Mexico City. Through the years, Human Development Reports have addressed a range of pressing global challenges and have reaffirmed that development is about enlarging people's choices and capabilities. The first of these reports which was first published in 1990, called for a paradigm shift in the measurement of development progress to put people at its very centre. It defined human development as a process of enlarging people's freedoms, choices and capabilities, and created the Human Development Index (HDI) in order to move beyond the traditional GDP measure for assessing the state of the country's development to a summary composite index that measures a country's average achievements in three basic aspects of human development: health, knowledge, and income."

She continued: "The rise of the South is unprecedented in its speed and scale and never in history have the living conditions and prospects of so many people changed so dramatically and so fast. This phenomenon goes well beyond the so-called BRICS, middle income countries often represented by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. It involves Africa as well," she underscored.

Motata-Alakija explained further that the Report shows that more than 40 developing countries have made greater human development gains in recent decades than would have been predicted, adding that these achievements are largely attributable to sustained investment in education, health care and social programmes, and open engagement with an increasingly interconnected world. She remarked that this historic progress is creating opportunities for the South and the North to collaborate in new ways to advance human development and confront shared challenges such as climate change.

Countries across the South, she added, are extending trade, technology and policy ties throughout the North, while the North is looking South for new partnerships that can promote global growth and development. "The report makes a significant contribution to development thinking by describing specific drivers of development transformation and by suggesting future policy priorities that could help sustain such momentum. The South as a whole is driving global economic growth and societal change for the first time in centuries and provides a detailed look at this fast-changing world," she said.

The senior economic advisor UNDP, Janice James, who delivered the welcoming address, revealed that the HDR started in 1990 and has covered various topics crucial to human development. Alieu Saho, deputy Statistician General at the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS) also made a presentation of the Gambia HDI at a glance.

The launching was graced by members of the Cabinet, senior government officials and representatives of the UN System in the country.

Nov 16, 2012 (ThinkAfricaPress/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- How has the CEDAW attempted to eradicate discrimination against women in the public and private spheres?

I - INTRODUCTION

TD 
	

The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) is the United Nations' treaty on women's rights. Adopted by the General Assembly in 1979, it was the first international treaty to address the fundamental rights of women in politics, health-care, education, economics, employment, law, property and marriage and family relations filling a major gap in international human rights law.

While earlier declarations and treaties obligated states to ensure that men and women were treated equally, CEDAW was the first to actually define acts of discrimination against women and is often described as an international bill of rights for women. At present 187 states are party to CEDAW, including the majority of African states (notable exceptions are Somalia and Sudan). This article describes the treaty, explains how the treaty is implemented, and discusses how women's rights activists in Africa have contributed to and made use of CEDAW.

II - THE TEXT OF CEDAW: NON-DISCRIMINATION IN ALL SPHERES

The preamble of the Convention recognises that despite various instruments already in place, 'extensive discrimination against women continues to exist'. Furthermore, it expresses a belief that 'the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world and the cause of peace require the maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields'.

To mitigate such conditions the Convention addresses three areas of women's rights, namely civil rights, legal status and reproductive rights. Whilst the legal rights of women are given the broadest attention, the treaty is also unique in the importance that it gives to human reproduction rights.

Under Article 1 of CEDAW, the term 'discrimination against women' is defined as 'any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital basis, on the basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field'. States that are party to the treaty commit to take measures to eliminate discrimination in all of these fields.

Article 7 underlines that, on an equal basis with men, women must be allowed to vote, hold public office, and participate in civil society. Article 9 states that they must have the same rights as men with to determine their nationality and the nationality of their children.

In addition, women must not face discrimination in education or employment - including on the basis of pregnancy or motherhood (Article 11). They must have equal access to health care, benefits, and financial credit (Article 12) and laws must not discriminate against women, either on their face or in fact.

Under CEDAW, states must take measures to suppress prostitution and trafficking of women (Article 6). They must also show particular concern for the discrimination faced by rural women, ensuring that rural women participate and benefit from rural development on an equal basis with men (Article 14). For instance, rural women have the same rights as men to organise themselves; to obtain training, education, and financial assistance; and to access land and housing.

III - NON-DISCRIMINATION IN MARRIAGE, FAMILY, AND CULTURE

Importantly, CEDAW enshrines women's right to non-discrimination in family and social life. Women are entitled to participate in recreational activities, sports, and cultural life on an equal basis with men. States must ensure that women have the same rights and responsibilities as men in marriage, divorce, and parenthood.

Unlike other treaties, CEDAW is also concerned with human reproduction. While it does not list a right to contraception or abortion, the treaty does obligate states to ensure that women have the same rights as men to determine the number and spacing of their children. Women must have access to "the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights". Additionally, states must ensure that women have adequate prenatal and postnatal health care and are not discriminated against on the grounds of marriage or maternity.

Under CEDAW, states are obligated to modify laws and government policies to prevent and address discrimination against women. But significantly, CEDAW also obligates states to take steps to modify sexist beliefs and behaviours. The preamble recognises that 'a change in the traditional role of men as well as the role of women in society and in the family is needed to achieve full equality between men and women. States, therefore, must work to eliminate customary practices that are based on the idea that women are inferior to men, and they must ensure that parenting is understood to be a shared responsibility between men and women to achieve equality in both the public and private spheres.

CEDAW's provisions requiring states to modify social and cultural attitudes toward women, and its requirements that women have equal rights in marriage and family life, have been its most controversial.

When ratifying a treaty, a state typically has the option to issue 'reservations' - statements that certain provisions of the treaty will not apply to that state. Many states parties to CEDAW have made reservations to the aspects of the treaty involving family life, marriage, and social and cultural life. In 1987, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern about a significant number of reservations that appeared incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention, and urged all states to reconsider them. The United States, one of the few countries not party to CEDAW, has cited these reservations as one of the reasons that it will not ratify the treaty.

Although reservations present obstacles to the implementation of CEDAW, the treaty generally enjoys broad international acceptance. With 187 states party to the Convention, CEDAW is one of the most widely-ratified human rights treaties.

IV - THE CEDAW COMMITTEE: MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION

The Committee on the Elimination on All Forms of Discrimination against Women (the Committee) monitors the implementation of the CEDAW treaty. The Committee is made up of twenty-three experts of high moral standing and competence in the treaty's subject matter. These experts are nominated by states parties and elected for two-year terms. Critics of CEDAW have sometimes argued that Committee members are 'radical' or 'extreme' women's rights activists, but most Committee members have not come from activist backgrounds at all - a large proportion of Committee members work in government.

i) The Periodic Reporting Process: A Constructive Dialogue

One of the Committee's major functions is to review each state party's progress in implementing CEDAW at the national level. It does so through a periodic reporting process. This process is designed to be a dialogue in which the Committee and states parties exchange ideas and views. However, the Committee is not an enforcement body and therefore it cannot force states to comply with CEDAW or punish states for failure to comply. Instead, the Committee works constructively with states to persuade them to more fully implement CEDAW.

A state party to CEDAW is obligated to submit a report to the Committee one year after ratifying the treaty, and then every four years after that. In this report the state describes the steps it has taken to implement the treaty. The Committee reviews this report and provides the state with questions to be discussed at hearings in which the state responds with written and oral reports. After considering these reports, the Committee produces its own report evaluating the progress of treaty implementation in the state and offering conclusions and recommendations for further action.

Like other human rights treaty bodies, the CEDAW Committee has had difficulty persuading some states parties to engage in the periodic reporting process. At the same time, the Committee has struggled to keep up pace with the flow of reports that it does receive. Until 1997, the Committee could only meet two weeks a year, resulting in a backlog of un-reviewed periodic reports. This situation has improved over the past 15 years: now the Committee meets more frequently, and it has been granted access to more United Nations resources. The Committee also considers bundles of reports from a single state at a time, issuing one set of conclusions and recommendations to these combined reports to increase efficiency.

ii) The role of NGOs in the Periodic Reporting Process

Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) may submit "shadow reports" providing their views on treaty implementation by states. Shadow reports can provide vital information of which a state is unaware, or which it does not wish to report. The Committee considers these shadow reports when formulating its conclusions and recommendations. The Committee also invites NGOs to present information orally at its sessions.

iii) General recommendations

In addition to offering focused comments to individual countries, the Committee issues general recommendations to raise awareness on certain issues. These general recommendations allow the Committee to elaborate on provisions in the treaty, or to explain how the rights enshrined in CEDAW apply to topics not mentioned in the treaty.

Violence against women is one prominent example. There is no mention of this in the text of CEDAW, but in 1992, the Committee used General Recommendation No.19 to explain that violence against women is a form of discrimination and is thus prohibited by CEDAW. The Committee's conclusion 'that not all the reports of States partes adequately reflected the close connection between discrimination against women, gender based violence, and violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms' prompted the recommendation. Accordingly, 'the full implementation of the Convention required States to take positive measures to eliminate all forms of violence against women'.

Some of the CEDAW Committee's commentary general recommendations, like its recommendation prohibiting violence against women, have been widely accepted. Others are more controversial. For example, some scholars and activists argue that the CEDAW Committee's comments on traditions practised primarily in the Global South - such as female circumcision and polygamy - devalue non-Western cultures or impose Western norms on the Global South and thus do not account for cultural subjectivity.

iv) Individual communications under the Optional Protocol

The Committee performs an additional function for states that are parties to CEDAW's Optional Protocol. Under the Optional Protocol, individuals and groups can submit communications to the Committee for adjudication. The Committee "adopts views" in response to these communications. The Committee adopts views on a handful of communications each year, and these views are a valuable source of international law on women's rights.

Finally, the Committee also has power under CEDAW's Optional Protocol to investigate systematic violations of the treaty. It concluded only one of these inquiries in 2005, finding 'grave and systematic violations of the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms Discrimination against Women' with regards to the abduction, rape and murder of women in the Ciudad Juarez area of Chihuahua, Mexico.

V - AFRICAN INVOLVEMENT IN CEDAW

African states and members of civil society have significantly contributed to, and made use of, CEDAW. As a result of advocacy by African women, nearly every African country has ratified the treaty. Moreover, most African countries (with the exception of North African countries) have ratified without issuing reservations.

Many African governments take the reporting process seriously - again, largely as a result of pressure by women voters and organisations - and have undertaken significant reforms to come into compliance with the treaty.

In 2008 the CEDAW Committee noted of Tanzania, for example, that the country was "committed to the implementation" of CEDAW and that it had made substantial progress in tackling discrimination against women. Sierra Leone provides another example of strong commitment to the treaty: The country modified its laws on marriage, divorce, inheritance, and domestic violence in 2007 in part due to the recommendations of the Committee. However, other African states have not engaged as fully with the treaty or reporting process. Although Chad and the Ivory Coast ratified CEDAW in 1995, for example, they did not submit their initial reports to the Committee until 2010 illustrating weaknesses in the authority of the Commission.

Accomplished lawyers and women's rights activists from Africa have served as CEDAW Committee members, shaping the Committee's work. Committee members from African countries have included Justice Rose Ukeje, the first female judge (and later Chief Judge) appointed to the Nigerian Federal High Court; Dorcas Coker-Appiah, a women's rights activist and lawyer from Ghana; and Pramila Patten, an international law expert who has drafted bills on domestic violence, family laws, and sex discrimination for her home country of Mauritius.

African NGOs engage in CEDAW's periodic reporting process by submitting shadow reports on their country's compliance with CEDAW. And by issuing shadow reports, African NGOs have influenced the CEDAW Committee's conclusions and recommendations.

Many African women's rights activists have used CEDAW as a tool to promote women's human rights, advocating for their governments to comply with CEDAW. Indeed, CEDAW has provided a springboard for regional women's rights agreements, such as the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (the Maputo Protocol). Originally adopted in 2003, the Maputo Protocol requires that States Parties shall ensure that the right to health of Women, including sexual and reproductive health is respected and promoted.

Finally, scholars and activists from Africa have worked to ensure that CEDAW is interpreted in a way that takes into account the experiences and needs of all women, not just women from the world's dominant cultures or groups.

One major opportunity for women's rights activists to engage further with CEDAW is through the use of the Optional Protocol. Despite the fact that many African states are party to the Optional Protocol, the Committee has never adopted views on a communication from Africa. In fact, the Committee has only adopted views on two communications from the Global South - one from the Philippines, and one from Peru. The likely cause of the Committee's geographical gap in jurisprudence is that organisations and individuals in the Global South are unfamiliar with how to utilise the communications procedure, and thus are not submitting communications to the Committee. Hopefully, as women's rights groups in Africa become more familiar with the Optional Protocol, African women will be better represented in the Committee's jurisprudence.

With the continued work of African women's rights activists, CEDAW and its Committee will serve as useful tools for eradicating discrimination against women on the continent.

Jul 23, 2012 (Anglican Communion News Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- A Communique from the Global South Conference on the Decade of Mission and Networking, July 16 - 21, 2012 at Bangkok, Thailand

...with the theme "Be Transformed by the Renewing of the Mind to Obedience of Faith for Holistic Mission in a Radically Changing Global Landscape" (Rom 12.1f; 2 Tim 4.7).

TD 
	

1. This Conference is a response to the call at the 4th Global South to South Encounter in Singapore April 2010 to gather leaders from Provinces of the Global South and other mission partners, which are unequivocally committed to the apostolic-historic faith for the Global South Conference on Decade of Mission and Networking.

2. We received with thanks a note of greeting from Dr Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who affirmed his support for the work of the Conference.

3. Similarly, we also received with thanks a note of greeting from Elder Fu Xianwei, Chairman of the National Committee of Three Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches of China. He affirmed his friendship with the Global South Anglican Churches and continual desire for further dialogue and partnership in ministry.

4. More than 100 delegates from provinces in the Global South (comprising Africa, Asia, the Pacific and South America) gathered together in prayer, fellowship and listening to the teaching of the Word. We were also joined by a number of our mission partners from other parts of the Communion and various Mission agencies.

5. We are immensely grateful for the wonderful hospitality and support shown to us by the Anglican Church in Thailand, a deanery in the diocese of Singapore and the Province of Southeast Asia.

6. The Holy Scriptures shaped our thinking on Mission and inspired our collective resolve to action. We found fresh insights from the Book of Romans. We were challenged to see Mission as "calling people from among the nations to the obedience of faith" (Romans 1:5 cf., 15:18, 16:26). Mission is not complete until it leads people to obey the true, living and only-wise God, who in His grace and righteousness (Romans 3-8), has saved humankind for newness of life (Romans 12-16) through Jesus Christ our Lord.

7. For nations to come to the obedience of faith, we as Christians individually and as the Church corporately need 'consecrated bodies and renewed minds' (Romans 12:1-3), so that we can share and live out and witness holistically to the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Romans 1:16) in the expanding spheres of community, nation and the world at large. Hence, the choice of the Conference theme so that all of us may be challenged "to offer our sanctified bodies (churches) and renewed minds as living sacrifices" for our Lord's glory.

Plenary Sessions

8. We took careful note of the radical change in the post-1989 geo-political landscape. The Global South is now a global "Antioch" church, which is multi-cultural and missionary-sending. We noted that the "centre of gravity in world Christianity" has shifted to the Global South.

9. Changing globalised patterns of thinking and action are likely to drive much of the activity in the world. We can expect a resurgence of traditional religious-cultural groups on the one hand, and hardened secularism and materialism on the other. These are the serious challenges that the global church is facing.

10. In the face of these challenges, our greatest need is for discipleship to take root and go deep. The way forward is to equip our churches with an emphasis on discipleship and character formation, marked with "humility, integrity, and simplicity."

11. Equipping the Global South churches means that the gospel should be contextualised so that it does not have a foreign but a local face and be effective in the local context. Along with this, we should strengthen an orthodox theology on the Church's role in nation-building. Our commitment is to a strong society marked by the rise of a civil society, political stability, sustainable economy, reduction of poverty, and the eradication of all forms of violence, endemic diseases and corruption.

12. We had an overview on Mission trends. The data presented on the growth of orthodox-evangelical churches in different contexts encouraged the assembly to continue with the work, especially in areas with difficult and hostile conditions. It complemented the two other papers by challenging us to face up to globalisation and cross-culturalism so as to be effective in a "multi-layered" world. We need to strengthen our theological education that it may have a missional dimension. We realised that we need to "pass on" (2 Timothy 2:2) through personal discipleship and the transformation of societies.

13. The Conference also heard from different regions of the Global South as well as from our Mission partners on the issues and challenges facing them.

Responses

14. In a globalised world, where local cultures and traditions have been weakened (along with time-tested values), there is a need for holistic discipleship. Therefore, we need to invest in the next generation. We need to start this as early as possible. This will include the environment in which the child or youth grows, including the family, church and school.

15. Much work needs to be done theologically and practically to guide the church in this call of discipleship within each culture. To this end, churches and theological centres need to share resources and to work together. Greater coordination is needed between theologians and theological centres. Much of this theological work is to apply within the context of the church community and her needs.

16. There were intensive discussions on the need for theological and economic empowerment. We are inter-dependent and we need each other. Constructive partnerships are needed to encourage each Province to be increasingly self-reliant. Much of this can happen through the mutual sharing of resources and building up of relationships. Economic and intellectual resources are needed to do the work.

17. In relating to other faiths, we need to engage in meaningful and constructive inter-faith dialogue. While we acknowledge that this could be difficult in some societies, we seek to encourage, help and support churches, both in better understanding our own faith and in facing more radical and political forms of other religions.

18. In the Mission of the Church, we are encouraged by some of the global trends. While we can attempt to project into the future from statistics based on present realities, we need to acknowledge the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit, which is a starting point for faith and courage in spreading the gospel.

19. The nature of the global Anglican Church affords us an opportunity to serve, work and learn together. This is a gift from God to the world, of a church which is globally connected and yet rooted into the local community. Our unity is both a witness and a conduit by which this work and witness flow.

"Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ....to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ! Amen." (Romans 16:25-27, ESV)

HD 	Church Vital to Development Says Report Highlighting Theology of Global South [press release]

Apr 23, 2012 (Christian Aid/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Christian Aid is giving a voice to theologians from the global South with a new report examining southern perspectives on climate change, HIV, globalisation and the global food crisis.

Theology from the Global South highlights the religious thinking around international development from countries in which much of that work is taking place.

TD 
	

One area it looks at is the vital role of the church and understanding faith communities in tackling problems such as adapting to climate change and HIV. Author Dr Paula Clifford, head of Theology at Christian Aid, said the church was often a more trusted source of information than politicians.

She said: 'For development workers churches are an obvious means of communicating essential information. Networks of churches extend into remote rural areas and their pastors are regarded as speaking with an authority that few politicians enjoy. At the height of the HIV crisis in Uganda vital information about prevention and treatment was rapidly transmitted, while care networks based on the existing practice of Christian communities were relatively easy to establish.'

The report quotes Prof Jesse N K Mugambi of the University of Nairobi who has pointed out the importance of understanding the African theology of working with nature when trying to address climate change adaptation measures.

Prof Mugambi said: 'African communities are struggling for survival while adapting to climate change in the best ways they can manage with meagre resources at their disposal, often with little or no support.'

He adds that religion is the most important focus for social mobilisation in Africa: 'Any externally sourced adaptation initiatives which ignore, overlook or denigrate African religiosity will not succeed because they will be rejected as alienating innovations by the majority of African communities to whom religion is the essence of life and the basis for personal and communal identity.'

Dr Clifford said: 'His comments are interesting in that they reflect widespread resentment in parts of sub-Saharan Africa that the North has largely caused the climate crisis and is now imposing its own solutions. Theologically, the key idea has to do with 'working with nature' and with the implicit suggestion that African communities with their religious orientation are best placed to understand this and act accordingly.'

The report also examines the feeling of collective guilt felt by many in the global North around climate change and draws parallels between this and feelings of the white Afrikaner community in South Africa during apartheid.

Other areas covered include how relational theology underlines issues of gender injustice and unequal power relationships as well as southern perspectives on resilient societies, the challenge of HIV and the importance of faith in developing country communities.

Manila, Philippines, Mar 26, 2012 (Ecumenical News International/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- As delegates to a World Council of Churches (WCC) gathering noted Christianity's growth in the global South, church leaders from Africa and Asia stressed that partnership in mission and evangelism is needed more than ever.

"We acknowledge that the growth of Christianity in the global South (Africa and Asia) is the result of the success of the North's mission and evangelism work," the Rev. Opoku Onyinah of the Pentecost Bible College in Ghana told ENInews on 23 March.

TD 
	

Speaking before a pre-assembly of the WCC Commission on World Mission and Evangelism (CWME), Onyinah said Pentecostal churches' emphasis on personal religious experiences and encounters with the Holy Spirit has helped many churches in Africa grow.

"But as the North needs missionaries from the South to help them in their evangelism and mission work, we still need each other's partnership," he said. The North, for example, can help provide theological training on mission and evangelism, which many Pentecostals lack, he said.

Filipino Roman Catholic Bishop Antonio Tobias of the Novaliches diocese in Quezon City, who is participating in the WCC pre-assembly in Manila, agreed with Onyinah.

"Our partnership with churches in the North is needed more than ever as we are called to also to help re-evangelize them," Tobias told ENInews. According to the Vatican, he said, "we are expected to send some of our missionaries to the North."

In its draft statement on mission and evangelism, the WCC commission affirmed that mission movements today are emerging from the global South and East.

Approved by the WCC-CWME executive group last 22 January, the draft was presented on 22 March to the pre-assembly, which gathered 226 participants from various churches. The participants have until 27 March to improve, comment on and enhance the statement, which will be finally presented before the WCC's 10th general assembly in Busan, South Korea in 2013.

The statement aims to seek renewed thinking on mission and evangelism, which will update the current one written in 1982.

Hosted by the National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP), the pre-assembly theme is "Together towards life: mission and evangelism in changing landscapes."

Church leaders stressed the values of embracing dynamism, transformation and diversity as part of the statement on mission and evangelism. "This new document offers us an opportunity to challenge the global church to move out further into the deep end of mission and evangelism to engage the life-denying realities that are enslaving people," said the Rev. Roderick Hewitt, of the United Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands and former moderator of the Council for World Mission.

The WCC General Secretary, the Rev. Olav Fykse Tveit, said that the statement on mission and evangelism will contribute greatly to the WCC Assembly theme "God of Life, lead us to justice and peace."

"The church has a mission to recognize and empower the marginalized as subjects of mission and not as objects only," said Tveit in his opening address. "Those on the boundaries are the frontiers in mission who can provide a vantage point for a new mission thinking that generates creative alternatives."

HD 	Climate Change - the North Must Pay for Mitigation Strategies [analysis]

Nov 29, 2011 (The South African Civil Society Information Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- As Durban welcomes the world for the COP 17 meeting, the air is filled with some of the excitement that we all felt during the World Cup last year.

But the debates around environmentalism and the need to take serious action against climate change are often tending to the superficial. There is a lot of self-righteousness and Hallmark style sentimentality around when what we need to a clear look at the realities of the situation.

TD 
	

Climate change is a reality and for a low-lying country like Bangladesh, it could be a very serious problem. There is no doubt that serious action needs to be taken and that it needs to be taken quickly. But when the debate slips, as it often does, into a sort of 'We are the World' sentimentality it forgets some essential facts. One of these facts is that it is North America and Western Europe that have caused this problem. They industrialised first and they became rich countries.

Here in Durban this morning, a debate around the North, civil society and who should be paying for clean energy alternatives emerged in a civil society discussion. What is clear is that the current crisis was caused by the North's industrialisation over the last two hundred years and they are therefore the ones with the moral responsibility to sort it out.

They are also the ones with the resources to be able to afford clean alternatives to fossil fuels. When it is suggested that we must all sacrifice in the fight against climate change there is a slippage into the assumption that we are all equally responsible when that is clearly not the case. We are not all equally responsible and the industrialised North needs to pay climate reparations along with reparations for colonialism and slavery.

When green technologies and energy sources are more expensive countries in the global South must not be forced to use them. Venezuela has a right to use its oil to meet the needs of its people. The rich countries in the North can afford to shift to clean energy and if it is necessary for the global South to follow suit then this must be subsidised by the North.

Some governments in Latin America have made this point very strongly and the logic of their argument is clear. But countries in the South cannot allow themselves to be bullied into shifting towards technologies that they cannot afford when the masses of their people remain in poverty.

There is also a longstanding colonial tendency to assume that modern civilisation rightly belongs in the white West but should not corrupt the rest of the world. This romantic nonsense is just a ploy to keep the people in the global South in their place, and their countries attractive playgrounds for the global elite. All countries have the same right to modernise and to meet their people's needs.

When environmentalists in the global South echo this colonial language that says that the natives are best left to their traditional ways they are often feted in the North. The Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva is a good example of this. But we should not forget that many progressive Indian academics and activists are extremely critical of her romantic anti-modernism which they see as being deeply complicit with colonial ideas about the noble savage. Marxists, who are committed to modern forms of economic development, are often appalled by her ideas.

The fact that China and India are now rapidly industrialising is sending all kinds of shock waves through the West, which is rapidly losing its position of dominance over the rest of the world. When the language of environmentalism is used in the North to question the rapid advance of India and China it often masks a desire to reserve industrialisation, and the economic power it brings, to the West.

But the discomfort that many of us feel with the green agenda on the global scale is also replicated at home.

Many black South Africans are deeply suspicious of the green agenda and there is good reason for this. Conservation was historically used to evict Africans from their land and the practise of evicting people in the name of 'eco-tourism' has continued after apartheid. So called 'eco-estates', in rural areas and in cities', are very often nothing other than zones in which the more extreme edge of white privilege uses a green language to make its exclusionary privilege seem like some sort of ethical commitment.

It's not unusual for middle class environmentalists that want to get rid of unsightly pollution, rubbish dumps or industrialisation in their areas to also want to get rid of poor African people from these areas. There is often a clear connection between environmentalism and racism in South Africa and its quite unusual for the green agenda to take questions of social justice seriously. In fact its quite clear that for many white people, and some wealthy black people too, the language of environmentalism is attractive because its gives its users the appearance of holding the ethical high ground without them having to question their own privilege with regard to other South Africans - most of whom are black and poor.

Of course there are some real attempts to link environmental questions to social questions. Here in Durban the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance and the work of people like Des D'sa and Bobby Peek is deservedly famous. The struggle against pollution in South Durban is a struggle lead by working class black people and it demands a clean environment for the people of Wentworth, Merebank and the Bluff. It does not see poor or working class black people as 'pollution', which is often a key assumption in much white environmentalism and much middle class black environmentalism.

If the green agenda is to have a future in South Africa it must face up to the historical responsibility of the North when it comes to climate change and it must find ways to, as has been done in South Durban, link environmental questions to social questions. In Latin America mass movements have been built that successfully link environmental questions to social questions but there in South Africa it remains a field that is dominated by white and middle class interests and often carries a deep hostility to poor black people.

HD 	Africa Must Lead - Cop 17 Must Deliver Climate Justice to Developing Nations [opinion]

Oct 07, 2011 (The South African Civil Society Information Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Climate change predominantly impacts those who have benefited least from fossil fuelled industrialisation. The poor have less social, economic and political capacity to adapt to climate change than the rich. The arrival of the global climate negotiating lobby on African shores must focus the minds of the world on how climate change impacts developing nations and how we propose to solve this problem.

When the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meets in Durban in late November this year it is important to raise global awareness of the implications for the global South - the poor and developing nations of the world. The matter of climate justice is central to any fair and binding solution.

TD 
	

The UN climate change framework arose from agreements made during the first earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, which destabilise global climatic systems. The best-known outcome from the many subsequent meetings was the agreement made in 1997 at COP 3 in Kyoto, Japan, with the so-called Kyoto protocol to reduce CO2 emissions.

This was the first time any sort of international accord was reached to address and reduce the threat of human induced (anthropogenic) climate change. The Kyoto Protocol will expire at the end of 2012 and it is critical that the Durban COP 17 meeting cements further agreement on frameworks to prevent runaway climate change this century. Time is not on our side.

The Kyoto protocol had extremely limited goals, far below what is now recognised as necessary. Importantly it was not ratified by the world's biggest polluter, the United States, which rendered its outcomes largely academic.

It is known that human induced climate change is no longer theoretical - the impacts are real and appear to be both more serious and rapid than the rather conservative scientific opinions expressed by the International Panel on Climate Change. These changes will predominantly affect those in the South who lack sufficient resilience to meet these multifaceted challenges.

Regions, like Pakistan and the Sahel in Africa, wedged between tropics and deserts, are far more sensitive to climatic disturbances than more temperate climates. Over the past two years Pakistan has experienced unprecedented monsoon flooding pushing this already marginal economy to the brink. The climate induced social and political consequences are profound.

The Sahel has experienced fairly regular drought cycles over the past millennium, influenced by various climatic cycles. However seriously disruptive droughts in that region between the 1960's and '80's are now known to be linked to fossil fuel related aerosols and particulates.

These influences, compounded by global warming, have worsened these drought cycles across the region, causing protracted hunger and social dislocation. It is notable that as cleaner fuels and improved emission standards have reduced the levels of man-made particles in the atmosphere, the severity of the Sahel droughts have diminished.

Those who deny the influence of human activity on the global climate are either incapable of internalising the realities or repudiate them in order to continue business as normal. This powerful lobby which continues to benefit from cheap access to fossil fuel technology has actively undermined meaningful political negotiations toward a meaningful resolution to the real problem - increasing emissions of greenhouse gases.

This self-indulgence perpetuates the historical economic inequality visited upon the global South by the developed North. This exposes the failure to achieve any sort of meaningful, ambitious and binding climate change treaty. The most powerful vested interests - the G8, the OECD, the developed North - are so profoundly politically compromised that they cannot see their way clear to make the needed changes. These dominant powers have more than hinted that there is little chance that agreement will be reached in Durban. Self interest remains writ large.

Besides the Kyoto Framework the next 'best' outcome that has emerged from these expensive and time consuming conferences is the so-called REDD+ framework. REDD stands for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation and is a trading mechanism, which proposes to keep global forests intact in order that climate change is mitigated and hopefully reduced.

REDD is controversial for many reasons, but primarily because of a failure to agree on the definition of a forest. This may appear obvious, but is a forest is a virgin natural resource, or a man made plantation which is harvested and hence has economic value? Because of this sort of intentional ambiguity inherent in "solutions" like REDD, strong opposition has arisen amongst indigenous and environmental groups who are profoundly uneasy with these sorts of agreements.

REDD and other economic carbon trading schemes are essentially devices which enable powerful, vested interests to exploit both the climate change negotiations and its proposed outcomes to ensure the continuation of business as usual. Perpetuating the interests of the privileged is no longer an option. In an increasingly connected world the exploited have gradually evolved a far more coherent position. REDD, like carbon trading, does nothing whatsoever to address the real problem - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They are just REDD herrings.

Dealing with solutions to climate change involves more than the authentic threats to the ecological stability of the planet. At its core, climate change involves dealing with issues of social and climate justice. Those who have benefited from decades of exploitation of fossil fuels must make amends. Those who remain excluded from these benefits, be they in Somalia or Pakistan, or in tropical jungles or low lying atolls, cannot be expected to continue to bear these punitive costs of climatic instability on top of their already impossible burdens. Perpetuating this inequity flies in the face of a just outcome to the climate negotiations.

The evolving power of blocs like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) has begun to provide some counterbalance against the old guard of developed nations. These shifts of economic and political power enable a change in the dynamic of negotiations.

This has become evident in how the South has refused the ratification of inherently unfair instruments like the World Trade Organisation's Doha round, which would have perpetuated unfairness in global trade. Equally, in climate negotiations there needs to be far more negotiating parity between North and South, between rich and poor, between developing and developed, in order that just outcomes become possible.

The fact remains that we cannot continue the historical polarisation and deadlock that have dogged critical negotiations like the UN climate change accords. The Durban COP 17 meeting needs flexible leadership. It requires humility from the powerful to recognise that it is their world, which is under equal threat. Above all cohesion amongst the global South is paramount in order that the vested interests of the wealthy cannot undermine a united message of climate justice for all.

In a globalised world we are increasingly interdependent and connected - the failure of even one nation inevitably creates further instability. It is not an option to have weak leadership by the hosts or to allow ourselves to be pushed around. As Nelson Mandela memorably told Bill Clinton when he visited South Africa in 1998, we must tell the powerful to "jump in a big pool" if they are out of line.

We cannot allow another negotiation failure at our collective expense. We need to wisely and firmly guide our leadership. We must harness creative ways to make the North listen. Civil society must repeat successful campaigns like the Right to Know campaign which has had perceptible political impacts in South Africa.

The mobilisation of the "Climate Justice Now!" network in South Africa hopes to provide one such platform towards achieving a beneficial outcome. We certainly cannot abandon negotiating governments to be bamboozled by the none too tender mercies of the diplomatic and lobbying interests of conservative and corporate stakeholders.

We need a fair, ambitious and binding agreement which does not paper over the cracks. There can be no perpetuation of business as usual with the false promises of carbon trading, where the rich offset their impacts onto the poor, or REDD, where forests are stripped and replaced with monoculture plantations. What is urgently needed is an agreement that goes past symptomatic relief and cuts to the core issue - the introduction of across the board reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate justice is about cutting a deal at the COP meeting that provides just that - climate justice for all, not justice for the rich. It is time to show that Africa can lead. In doing so we, the people of Africa, must collectively hold our leaders responsible.

Ashton is a writer and researcher working in civil society.

Sep 08, 2011 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Object of racism is no longer the individual, but a certain form of existing - Frantz Fanon. Where does oppression begin? The above quote is taken from the essay "Racism and Culture" from the collection "Towards the African Revolution" by Frantz Fanon.

Fanon was a genius at spotting the many smaller battles that prevent people from realising their full potential, weaving together brilliant meta-narratives that demonstrated that oppression began long before the individual situated himself in the formal political arena.

TD 
	

Fanon rightly argues that oppression is about structures of power that influence or impact on individual and communal self-worth, and in this breath I'd like to bring something up that is decidedly beyond the realm of formal politics.

Over the last few weeks, the question of the woman of colour and her body has been a recurring theme in my personal conversations. On one hand, the question of sexuality reared its head as the global (read North American and European) "Slut Walks" ostensibly designed to insist that the style of a woman's dress was no invitation for sexual assault. The question levelled at this movement, however, is to what extent women outside Europe and North America view this as an integral part of their day-to-day life.

Which is not to say that sexual assault doesn't happen in the global south - that would be a laughable assertion.

However, the vast scale of sexual assault in the DRC for instance emphasises that rape in many similar communities is an act of political rather than personal violence, not any more or less grave, just different.

I wonder what the women of Eastern Congo would say to the "Slut Walkers" if they had a chance? For the uninitiated, since the era of slavery, when African American women were forced to cover their hair because it was "filthy, or disgusting", women in the African community have been debating the social and political dimensions of relaxers, dreadlocks and natural hair.

This is no trivial matter - for many women the politics of hairstyle is completely integrated to their self-perception and their status within their communities. Whether we like it or not, our choice of hairstyle is almost always interpreted as some kind of political statement, and almost always intractably linked with the notion of race.

Relaxers, it is argued, are emblematic of the self-loathing internalised by women of African descent over years of oppression, and indeed Malcolm X has a wonderful speech available on You Tube on the question of "who taught you to hate yourself?" dealing explicitly with this idea.

These two issues are linked firstly because you see the continuing tension between race and gender in women of colour. During the independence/civil rights era, women were often compelled to subjugate their gender-based rights struggles for the greater good - it was almost as if being black was harder than being a woman. When you get the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late

1960s and 1970s, you find many women stuck between rights issues that emerge from a rather Western framework (the debate on the public-private divide) and rights issues that pay no attention to the struggles which women of colour face against their own men.

Post-colonial feminism continues to argue for the right of women of colour to have their struggles articulated in their own terms, but modern women of colour are still sensing that they have to wear different hats to fight each battle, or that they cannot be fought concurrently.

Secondly, the issues are linked because they emphasise the continuing struggle over the black woman's body. The notion of rape as linked to dressing sexy would seem alien to many women of the global south because most women who are raped in the global south dress no differently than any other women in their community.

By labelling their movement "global", the Slut Walks - with all their good intentions - inherently lay claim to the oppression of women's body in a manner that many black women may find a historical. In the same breath, the politics of women's hair is often defined by others - Ngugi wa Thiong'o has written about women's hair, Chris Rock has produced a hit movie about the politics of "Good Hair".

A feminist may argue that a black woman has the right to wear her hair however she wants, while those who stress racial oppression more may argue that the political dimensions run far too deep for

the decision to be taken lightly. Fanon talks about how the "social constellation, the cultural whole" is deeply intertwined with the nature of racism; that as overt racism even then became less of an acceptable practice, it evolved into cultural racism.

"The daily affirmation of superiority" becomes an implied act through cultural forms think of representations of people of colour as criminals, sexually deviant or generally exotic in popular culture.

Racism is socialised and the process of teaching a people that they are inherently lesser than a mainstream culture is therefore a process of oppression. I would argue that the same analysis extends towards women's bodies; that as women's rights issues have gained prominence, the oppression of women has changed form and become a more cultural oppression.

The sexualisation of women in popular culture as "liberation" should thus be taken with a generous dash of scepticism. All of which leads to a question that I'm still searching for answers to: Can African women or women of African descent ever be truly liberated if they never learn to love their hair as it grows out of their head?

Sep 05, 2011 (Zimbabwe Standard/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- According to Greek philosopher Aristotle, "a state's purpose is not merely to provide a living but to make a life that is good." However, statistics suggest that sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia are the hungriest, poorest and least-happy regions in the world.

How then, could it be possible that the states in these regions are concurrently unable to provide their populations with good-living, and for what reasons?

According to the Oxford Dictionary of Sociology, "the dependency theory" is a set of theories which maintain that the failure of Third World states to achieve adequate and sustainable levels of development results from their dependence on the advanced capitalist world.

In other words, according to the dependency theory, the explanation for the economic (under) development of states in the Global South should be viewed in terms of the external, political, economic, and cultural influences on national development policies.

It has often been argued, for example, that Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAP's) introduced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to much of Africa are the very reasons for the continent's high levels of foreign debt.

Having said that, third world states need to foster internal accountability and good governance. While Third World countries are documented as the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world, they are also reported to be the most corrupt.

The Berlin-based organisation, Transparency International reports that the most corrupt states in the world are for the most part located in the Global South, with Somalia, Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Iraq topping the list.

Furthermore, Third World leaders borrow too much from the colonial rhetoric of yester-year. It is far too late in the evening to base prospective development policies on the political sloganeering of yesterday morning the very reason Julius Malema's nationalisation drive cannot work.

What's needed is a committed spirit of diligence that will see the periphery through the night, and move on to a new dawn. Developed countries have set an example.

Understandably, the liberation histories of Africa and the rest of the developing world should not be forgotten. However, a blind beggar migrating with his family in search of greener pastures is a pitiful sight, to say the least, and ultimately, it demonstrates that Third World states, when judged against Aristotle's standard, have failed.

Sep 21, 2010 (United Nations/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Despite obstacles, scepticism and a fast-approaching 2015 deadline, the Millennium Development Goals could be achieved if the global community stayed true to the promise made a decade ago to end the dehumanizing conditions of poverty by making smart investments in infrastructure, opening export markets and generally rethinking conventional wisdom, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told world leaders today as he opened the General Assembly's high-level meeting to take stock of progress.

Above all, there was a need for political leadership. "We are waiting on you, world leaders," he said, adding: "The clock is ticking, with much more to do." The Goals could not be truly fulfilled while so many people lacked the basics for a life of dignity. Addressing inequality among and within countries was vital. States should not balance their budgets "on the backs of the poor", nor withdraw from official development assistance. On Wednesday, before the close of the meeting, he would launch a Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health, which he called the best chance for a multiplier effect across the Goals.

Considered a breakthrough when they were adopted 10 years ago at the Millennium Summit, the eight Goals formed a blueprint for ending extreme poverty that all partners, even those with differing views, had been able to embrace. With just five years left in that 15-year plan, there was no global project more worthwhile. "Let send a strong message of hope. Let us keep our promise," the Secretary-General urged.

With the creation of the Goals, the world body had brought forth great hopes for millions of people, said Joseph Deiss (Switzerland), President of the General Assembly, and now the 192-member body must live up to them. "We have no right to fail," he stressed. While the economic and financial crisis had jeopardized gains, States understood that they had the know-how and the resources to succeed. What was needed was commitment. He called on all participants, as individuals, Heads of State and Government, and Members of the United Nations to proclaim their will to create the conditions essential for meeting the 2015 deadline.

However, it would take more than goodwill and commitments for the world's poor to begin seeing improvements, said Ali Abdussalam Treki (Libya), former Assembly President who co-chaired the high-level event. It would take good policies, tireless implementation and financial resources. To bring about the changes mandated in the Millennium Declaration, hundreds of billions of dollars were still needed. The quality, effectiveness and disbursement of aid were "far from optimal".

Joining those officials in opening the session were the heads of several United Nations bodies and related international institutions, who painted a mixed picture of the state of global affairs, especially in the aftermath of the economic and financial crisis, and outlined measures to spur change. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, said the future hinged on restoring sustainable global growth to pre-crisis levels. Advanced economies should keep their Gleneagles pledges on aid and open trade markets, while developing nations should mobilize domestic tax revenue, which could be used to create social safety nets.

Additionally, said Pascal Lamy, Director-General of the World Trade Organization, ensuring quota-free access to markets was essential, as was the successful close of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations. Speaking to the development perspective in that equation, Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in her capacity as Chair of the United Nations Development Group, said progress required more inclusive economic growth models, scaled-up social protections and more access to affordable energy. Leaders could make changes needed to put their countries on the fast track to achieve the Goals. Going forward, the pledge made a decade ago could be turned into reality. "Let's just do it," she said.

In the debate that followed, political leaders from all points on the map drew attention to substantial gains made in such areas as education, health and women's empowerment, and underscored the importance of international assistance in helping their economies stay the course en route to 2015. The economic and financial crisis had eroded, or in some cases wiped out, hard-won gains, some said, and their Governments would need technical, human and financial capital for some sectors to again succeed.

To that point, Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France, asked if the recent crisis was going to be used as a pretext for doing less or an opportunity to keep promises. He announced that France, the second-highest contributor in assistance in euros each year, would increase its contribution by 20 per cent over the next three years to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. He also urged consideration of innovative financing measures to generate the resources necessary to meet the Goals.

Other leaders decried what they viewed as a skewed global economic order that catered to the strong at the expense of the weak. Evo Morales, President of Bolivia, said, rather than incessantly focusing on the effects of extreme poverty, more time should be spent discussing its causes. Indeed, unfair wealth distribution had created deprivation and the current economic and political framework was not geared towards solving that problem. To reach the Goals, the global South must stop financing the global North, he declared, noting that such transfers had hit more than $500 billion in 2009. A bank of the global South should be created so developing countries could finance themselves without conditions, and break their dependence on the International Monetary Fund.

Offering a different perspective, Malawi's President Bingu Wa Mutharika was confident that his country would meet all eight Goals to varying degrees. While those related to universal primary education, gender equality and maternal mortality required more concerted efforts, the remaining five would definitely be achieved. Speaking about Africa as a whole, he urged the United Nations to review supply-side issues, which would improve access to services for ordinary people, especially women and children. Mompati Merafhe, Vice-President of Botswana added that more support was needed for least developed and landlocked developing, and small island developing States because, on their own, they lacked the capacity to mitigate development challenges.

Also making opening remarks were the President of the Economic and Social Council, President of the World Bank and Secretary-General of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

The Heads of State and Government of Honduras, Uzbekistan, Kenya, Israel, Guatemala, Croatia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Turkmenistan, Serbia, Timor-Leste, Viet Nam, Namibia, Georgia, Comoros and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia also spoke.

Also addressing the Assembly today were the Kings of Swaziland, Jordan and Morocco, as well as the Emir of Qatar and Prince of Monaco.

The Prime Ministers of Bhutan, Spain, Norway, Samoa, Belgium, Liechtenstein, Bangladesh, United Republic of Tanzania, Togo and Greece also addressed the Assembly. Also delivering remarks was the Second Vice-President of Burundi.

Also speaking was the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, as were the Federal Councillor of Switzerland and the foreign ministers of Thailand, Tunisia, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, Ecuador, New Zealand, Mozambique, Estonia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq and Yemen.

The Deputy Foreign Minister of Czech Republic also spoke, as did the Ministers of State of the Republic of Moldova, United Arab Emirates and Dominica, and the Secretary of State for External Relations of Angola and the State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Oman.

The meeting also featured addresses by the Minister for Home Affairs of Nepal and the Minister for Health of Nigeria. The Vice-Minister of Colombia spoke, as did the Vice-Minister of Planning of Mexico.

Also participating in the meeting were the representatives of Saudi Arabia and Lebanon.

Speaking were the President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace of the Holy See, President of the European Commission (on behalf of the European Union), Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Secretary-General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Assistant Secretary-General for Social Affairs of the League of Arab States.

The Assembly will reconvene at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, 21 September, to continue its high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals.

Background

The General Assembly met today to convene a high-level meeting to review progress on the Millennium Development Goals, which is set to run through Wednesday, 22 September. With five years to go before the 2015 deadline for worldwide achievement of the Goals - which include cutting hunger and poverty in half, providing basic education for children, reducing infant and maternal mortality by two thirds and three quarters, respectively, and reversing the spread of infectious diseases - nearly 140 Heads of State and Government are expected to identify gaps and commit to steps to reach the targets agreed at the Millennium Summit.

In addition to plenary meetings and round-table discussions on key issues, various partnership events by Governments, United Nations agencies and leaders from civil society, foundations and the private sector are expected to result in announcements of new initiatives, including on women's and children's health. At the end of the three-day gathering, world leaders are expected to adopt an action agenda, which would include measures for advancing progress on each Goal.

Opening Remarks

President of the General Assembly, JOSEPH DEISS, of Switzerland, quoting his country's Constitution, said "the strength of a community is measured according to the well-being of its poorest". It was a moral duty to take care of the well-being of the other, an idea that summed up what the international community had pledged to do regarding the Millennium Development Goals. In 2000, the most ambitious programme to combat poverty had been approved, showing that all peoples made up one single community. No one could stand aloof from the suffering of others.

At that Millennium Summit, the General Assembly had brought forth great hopes for millions of people with the adoption of the Millennium Declaration and its Development Goals, he said, and now the 192-member body must live up to those hopes. "Let us attain the Millennium Development Goals," he said. "We want to do it. We must do it and we can do it." Beyond what Governments could do, there had been an enormous impetus in civil society and economic affairs. He called on all - as individuals, Heads of State and Government, and Members of the United Nations - to proclaim their will to create the conditions essential for attaining the Goals by 2015. One great merit of the Goals was that they set forth crystal clear targets with a clear deadline.

Now, with the world emerging from crisis, real progress must be made, he said. Yes, poverty had receded globally, but some regions, especially sub-Saharan Africa, were lagging behind. Additional efforts were particularly needed to combat poverty, improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. While the crisis had jeopardized gains, "we know what we must do and we have the resources to achieve what we must". What was needed was commitment from donors and beneficiaries. There must be a real partnership. "If we want to succeed, we must do so together."

There was an excellent atmosphere at today's opening of the summit. A broad consensus had been achieved on the draft outcome document and he thanked those who had moved beyond their national interests to achieve consensus. Indeed, the document provided the basis for action in the run up to 2015 and in that context, he urged a serene discussion. "We have no right to fail," he said. "The world's eyes are upon us."

ALI ABDUSSALAM TREKI, of Libya, former President of the General Assembly, in his welcome, noted the presence of so many high-level participants set a "strong, unified and unequivocal" message to the world about the importance of fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals. Reminding the Assembly of its commitment to reach the clear targets outlined in the Goals by 2015, he heralded the progress that had been made in the past decade, including health care reaching more people than ever, and more children in school than 10 years ago, to name a few.

However, he noted the need for improvement in the areas of gender equality, maternal mortality, observing that almost 1 billion people still suffered from hunger and malnutrition. The need for environmental sustainability and a fully realized global development partnership was also a challenge to be addressed as well, and he urged for such work to continue. "We may disagree and have differences of opinion on how best to achieve these Goals, but we are in agreement as to the importance of not allowing the poor to be left behind," he stated.

Turning to the past year's efforts, he spoke of the openness, transparency and inclusiveness - pillars of the Assembly work that had been central to his Presidency. The creation of UN Women and the revitalization of the General Assembly, among other benchmarks, were examples of how the United Nations remained a central component in developing and promoting the ideals of the United Nations Charter. However, frankly speaking, he said that whatever was agreed at this week's Summit would "only be words" unless the Organization's efforts improved the lives of the poorest countries and communities.

Continuing, he said it would take more than goodwill for the world's poor to begin seeing such improvements; it would take good policies, tireless implementation and, of course, financial resources. Indeed, in order to bring about the changes mandated in the Millennium Declaration, hundreds of billions of dollars were still needed, and he asked why, with the enormous amount of aid already proffered, that such challenges still existed. Illuminating the issues of misuse and misappropriation of resources and aid, he noted that the quality, effectiveness and disbursement of aid were "far from optimal."

The Goals were only a framework, he continued, and development assistance could only accomplish so much. In that regard the need for foreign and domestic financial investment, intensive job creation and pro-poor growth were essential to the transformation of developing countries into "self-sufficient economies". To that end, he called for a strong and equitable global partnership. Although there would still be poverty, hunger, and millions of people living in "unliveable conditions" in 2015, he said that a concerted effort through goodwill could resolve so much and he urged the Assembly forward to reach the Millennium Goals.

Welcoming delegates to the summit, United Nations Secretary-General BAN KI-MOON, said "we are here because the fight for a more prosperous, stable and equitable world is at the heart of the United Nations".

Ten years ago, meeting at the highest level, the global community had promised to spare no effort to free the world from want. The Millennium Development Goals were a breakthrough. Together, participants at the Millennium Summit had created a blueprint for ending extreme poverty, defined achievable targets and established a framework that all partners - even those with differing views - had been able to embrace.

"Now, we have real results," he said, pointing to path-breaking public-private partnerships, dramatic increases in school enrolment, expanded access to clean water and better control of disease - in sum: more development success stories than ever before. The transitional impact of the Goals was undeniable and that was an achievement about which to be proud.

At the same time, those advances, many of them fragile, must be protected, he stressed. There was much more to do, particularly for the mother who watched her children go hungry, a scandal repeated a billion times each night; for the young girl, weighed down with wood or water, when she instead should be in school; and for the worker far from home in a city slum, watching jobs disappear.

The reports before delegates today were filled with statistics, analysis and recommendations, he said, everything needed for effective policies and programmes. Today, the global community was being asked to stay true to its commitment to end the dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, which meant making smart investments in infrastructure, small farmers and social services. On Wednesday, he would launch a Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health, "our best chance for a multiplier effect across the Goals".

That commitment also meant supporting the vulnerable, despite the economic crisis, he said, stressing: "We should not balance budgets on the backs of the poor", nor draw back from official development assistance (ODA). It also meant truly fair trade and action on climate change, as deferring tough decisions to future generations only increased the costs. Being true meant addressing inequality, among and within countries - even those that had registered impressive gains - as well as reconsidering conventional wisdom.

Despite the obstacles, scepticism and fast-approaching 2015 deadline, the Goals were achievable, he said. This year, he had visited nearly a dozen African countries and seen what was possible, especially in Millennium Villages in Malawi and Benin. Such faith must be rewarded with resolve, by using the tools at hand to deliver resources and, above all, exercising political leadership.

With that, he urged participants to make the Millennium Development Goals their own. "We are waiting on you, world leaders." The Goals could not be truly fulfilled while so many lacked the basics for a life of dignity. "Let us make this investment in a better future for all." There was no global project more worthwhile. "Let us keep our promise."

HAMIDON ALI, President of the Economic and Social Council, noted the "vital goal" that body had played in fulfilling the aims of the United Nations Charter, and he recalled the Assembly's 2005 World Summit had mandated the Council to take a greater role in reaching the Millennium Development Goals. To that end, two new functions, the Development Cooperation Forum and the Annual Ministerial Review had been incorporated and implemented into the Council's efforts.

The Council focused on all the Millennium Goals, he continued, with its contribution to gender equality being "especially notable". Furthermore, the number of countries - 34 since the Annual Ministerial Review had become a part of the Council's substantive work - volunteering to present their national level experiences had been encouraging. During the Council's 2010 session in July, 13 countries presented such progress reports, and another 13 were set to do the same in 2011.

Remarking on an area that called for improvement - monitoring commitments and accountability for developing and developed countries alike - he said that this year marked the second time the Development Cooperation Forum had held "groundbreaking discussions", and established itself as a key venue for global dialogue. The Forum was prepared to play an enhanced role in reaching the Millennium Goals by 2015. He requested that when the Assembly reviewed the role of the Council during the sixty-fifth session, that it focus on the strengthening of the role of the Forum, which should meet every year rather than every two years.

Concluding, he turned to other areas being addressed by the Council, including the coordination of development work and operations with the Peacebuilding Commission and the importance of achieving the Millennium Goals in countries emerging from conflict. Stating the Council's solidarity with Haiti, he noted the special challenges that country faced as it emerged from disaster recovery and transitioned to development. Through integrating resources from private and academic sectors, among other activities, the Council's work towards the Goals would continue in a successful manner, he added.

ROBERT ZOELLICK, President of the World Bank, said the Millennium Development Goals were central to the role of the Bank Group's mission and everyday work. It would continue to work with its members, the United Nations and civil society to deliver the promise of the Millennium Declaration: a world that overcame poverty and hunger; where all citizens had access to opportunity and hope. "Success is possible," he said, noting that in 1981, 52 per cent of people lived in extreme poverty; by 2005, that number had been cut by more than half. Efforts by developing countries had paid off right up until the economic and financial crisis, with poverty falling sharply in East Asia, Latin America, and Eastern and Central Europe.

Success, however, had been uneven, and the "triple blow" of food, fuel and financial crises, had slowed and even reversed progress in many countries around the world, he continued. In 2010, 64 million more people were in extreme poverty; some 40 million more went hungry because of the crises. By 2015, the Bank estimated that 1.2 million children under 5 could die, and 100 million more people would not have access to safe water. "These are not just challenges for a summit week. These are everyday challenges," he declared, stressing that poverty, hunger, inadequate education and disease were problems that affected communities far beyond the developing world. Indeed, 70 per cent of the world's poor lived in middle-income countries.

Turning to the Bank's work, he highlighted its "Access Agenda", a programme that would help to ensure access to basic health, quality schooling, clean water, energy, food, and jobs. Such efforts would supplement the $33 billion in health and nutrition initiatives undertaken in developing countries over the past decade.

In health, the World Bank was increasing the scope of results-based programmes by more than $600 million until 2015, he continued, noting that it would focus on 35 countries, notably East Asia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which faced challenges in achieving the Millennium Development Goals due to high fertility, poor child and maternal nutrition, and high rates of child and maternal disease.

To help countries reach education goals, the World Bank was increasing its zero-interest investment in basic education by an additional $750 million, with a focus on those countries not on track to reach the Goals. Despite having quadrupled its lending since 2000, the Bank, he said, was increasing its infrastructure support, and to agriculture, which he said was central to boosting incomes, employment, and food security in many low-income areas.

Today, it was emerging economies helping to pull the world out of recession. Some were emerging as economic powers and some were struggling to attain their potential in a new system. "I believe in Africa," he said, stressing that the continent could become a global pole of growth. Before the economic and financial crisis, African economies were growing at 5 per cent a year and poverty was declining by about 1 per cent per year - a rate faster than India. Primary school enrolment was rising faster than on any other continent. Yet, there was another side: the nearly 400 million who lived on $1.25 a day, the massive infrastructure deficit that leaves many without food, water or electricity.

With the right policies and good governance, with support for infrastructure and skills training, he stressed that Africa could attract investment. In tourism, international tourism receipts had tripled in Africa. That could just be the beginning, he said. In conclusion, he said it was important to remember to look beyond the numbers; invest in what worked and fix what did not. It was also important to remember that the international community's development work was ultimately about empowering people, families and communities.

DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said years of progress had been lost because of the economic and financial crisis. As a result, about 70 million fewer people would escape the chains of poverty by 2020 and many millions more would suffer the consequences of underemployment or unemployment. "We must strive for a speedy return to the pre-crisis past," he stressed. Everything hinged on restoring balance and sustainable global growth. "I do insist on this." Without global growth, all other efforts to achieve the Goals would be frustrated. "We will be treading water against a rapidly advancing tide," he asserted.

For advanced economies, and leading emerging market economies, the first focus must be on securing a sustainable global economy and "getting the growth engine up and running again". That was not just a mantra - it was real and essential and it affected people's lives. Advanced economies should help developing countries by keeping Gleneagles pledges on aid and by opening trade, which was among the most important ways to unleash developing country potential.

For their part, developing countries must help themselves by building on past success, he continued. Many had created fiscal and monetary room to support their economies and the most vulnerable in them. Importantly, they must build "policy buffers" by mobilizing domestic tax revenue, which would help build social safety nets. International institutions must also do their part. During the crisis, the Fund had quadrupled its lending and created, for the first time, zero-interest loans to developing countries and streamlined its conditions.

The United Nations and the Fund shared common goals, he said, noting that both had been founded in the wake of the Second World War, when economic conflict had led to real conflict. Leaders of the post-War world had vowed never to repeat such mistakes. The Fund's mandate began with economic stability and ended with a prosperous and peaceful world. "We in the Fund, and you here in the United Nations, must now fulfil the mandate," he said. With so many fellow citizens marginalized, participants today had the opportunity to start again. "Let us together fulfil that post-war promise and look forward to a world free of poverty and conflict."

PASCAL LAMY, Director-General of the World Trade Organization, spoke of how that agency had actively participated in efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goal 8 on the global partnership for development. The main aim of the World Trade Organization was to regulate trade, reduce trade barriers and create trade membership based on equality, regardless of whether a country was large, small, rich or poor.

The advantages of countries opening their borders to trade were obvious, including, among others, greater poverty reduction and stronger economic development. Developing systems that established general use of restrictive trade prevented the poorest countries from being penalized and kept trade open. Offering a brief overview, he stated recent estimates showed trade volume increases of 13.5 per cent, which was more than previously considered. The World Trade Organization's work ensured that the poorest countries were able to emerge more quickly from recession.

He said that more work could be done in the area of regulations, and strengthening of world partnerships and that to make good on past promises, ensuring access to markets without any quotas was essential. That would assist the poorest countries and make it possible for them to grow in the future. In the future, the agency's conferences would examine the highlights and central elements of general trade. Calling for the Doha Round of trade negotiations to be brought to a successful close, he concluded by stating that the efforts of the World Trade Organization and those of agencies and Governments aiming to ensure achievement of the Millennium Goals would lead to "true development" if all were reached at the same time.

SUPACHAI PANITCHPAKDI, Secretary-General of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said that Millennium Development Goal agenda had helped to galvanize the collective promise to the international community to "make globalization a positive force for the world's people"; however, the ongoing economic and financial crisis has been a major setback, putting the Goals beyond the reach of some regions by 2015.

Yet, even before the crisis, many countries were struggling to keep on track and, while the reasons were complex, a lack of productive investment and persistent employment in low-productivity fields had kept incomes low, and restricted economic diversification in many developing countries. He said that UNCTAD has consistently pointed to the failure of finance-driven globalization and economic growth to establish the policy framework needed to address the structural causes of widespread poverty and deprivation, he said, citing the urgent need for policy change and action to help many countries achieve their goals.

The broader framework would emphasize investment, most notably in productive capacity, an equitable distribution of resources; policy space; and sustainable employment generation as the main drivers of poverty reduction, he said. Supporting the framework at the international level, however, would require a renewal of trust along the multilateral system, he said, noting Thailand's successful experiment with "sufficiency economy", which helped alleviate poverty for millions of people.

The aim of that approach had been to find ways of engaging, in a balanced manner, safely and inclusively, with a globalizing world. It emphasized development from within, conservation and moderation, which called for the sustainable use of resources and concern for the social and environmental impact of economic decisions. Finally, he stressed that: "To match the vision demonstrated back in 2000 and meet the MDGs - whether by 2015 or after - we must again find the courage and ambition to change the path of our economic development."

HELEN CLARK, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), speaking in her capacity as Chair of the United Nations Development Group, said the summit could be "a real turning point" for achieving the Goals. The challenge would be to follow words with actions and to keep pledges honoured. A series of crises, natural disasters and conflict did not make that task any easier, nor did it make it impossible. Achievement of one Goal could spur progress on another. In that work, it would be vital to support country-led development processes, as well as to foster accountability, rule of law and human rights - the lack of which were all barriers to achievement of the Goals.

Progress would require more inclusive economic growth models, she said, and, following the Global Jobs Pact, providing productive work. In addition, it would require increasing access to affordable energy; scaling up social protections; establishing effective budget systems; and building the capacity to deliver on the ground. It would require investing more in the rights of women and girls; clean water and sanitation; and attending to the needs of the urban poor. "If we focus on the most impoverished, we will also see quick improvements in maternal and child health," she said, potentially averting millions of deaths.

With that in mind, she said, all the agency's programmes were ready to support nations in their quest to meet the Goals. In recent months, UNDP teams had piloted a framework to accelerate progress on the Goals, identifying bottlenecks and solutions. Failure to meet the Goals could not be blamed on a lack of resources or know-how. Proven policies adapted to national contexts would ensure progress. Leaders could make changes needed to put their countries on the fast track to achieve the Goals. Every day, efforts could go into reaching a trade deal, as well as a climate deal that both fostered development and protected the planet. Achieving the Goals drew everyone together. Going forward, the pledge made a decade ago could be turned into reality. "Let's just do it," she said.

Statements

PORFIRIO LOBO SOSA, President of Honduras, said 10 years ago, Heads of State and Government had recognized and defended the principles of human dignity. A decade later, the commitment to those fundamental values must be ratified. In 2010, the greatest challenge was to extend the benefits of global economic growth to 1 billion people living in extreme poverty. Good management in beneficiary countries and citizen-led efforts also were indispensable to breaking the bonds of hunger and ignorance. The Millennium Development Goals were a first step on the right track, and he called for a new international agreement that would bind actions and the Goals by 2015.

He agreed that extreme poverty could be combated, but the fight called for strengthened efforts. There was a joint responsibility to protect and share "common international goods"; solidarity through ODA. One such good should be prudent economic management. The same could be said for open trade and financial systems, as well as for access to international markets. In the coming years, "we must act with more energy and work faster", he stressed.

Describing the global picture, he said the population living on $1.25 a day had decreased only slightly and there had also been limited progress in other areas. While universal primary education had advanced, promoting women's empowerment called for more efforts. At the same time, progress on reducing maternal mortality was far from the target set by the Goals. As for HIV/AIDS, there was an enormous task ahead in tackling the spread of that disease, and more investment was needed. Some countries had achieved progress, including Honduras, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Cambodia and Ghana. Studies suggested that those countries could meet many of the Goals, and he called for renewed efforts to reach them.

NICOLAS SARKOZY, President of France, heralded the progress made towards sustainable development over the past decade, but stressed that "the road still to be travelled is a very, very long one". With five years left to reach the Millennium Development Goals, he asked the Assembly if the recent economic crisis was going to be used as a "pretext of doing less", or an opportunity to keep the promises made 10 years ago when the Goals were launched. He then announced that France, the second highest contributor in assistance in euros each year, would be increasing its contribution by 20 per cent over the next three years to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Regardless of the deficits and concerns France and other members of the international community faced in the wake of the global financial crisis, the consequences of not fulfilling the Goals were much more serious.

He called for all developed countries to join France, do more, and to make Africa a priority. He stated the known fact that 1 million children died each year from malaria. "Let me be crystal clear: before the end of my statement, 30 children will have died from malaria. We have no right to hide behind the crisis to do less." It was not a question of making statements but taking action and decisions and that the goals needed were not just public funds but involvement from the private sector.

As the future President of the Group of 20 (G-20) and the Group of Eight (G?8), France planned to do its utmost to incorporate innovative financing into the global dialogue. Developing countries suffering from deficits needed to find new sources to resolve the major health crises and educational challenges they faced, and he told the Assembly: "We can take decisions here. Why should we wait?" For example, he noted that the financial commitments on climate change made in Copenhagen wouldn't be possible to reach unless innovative financing was implemented. Concluding, he called for next year to be a year of change. Member States must not fall back into bad habits. In that regard, France would not just be making statements or offering lessons but would actively participate in concrete initiatives and lead the world towards solidarity and innovative financing.

ISLAM KARIMOV, President of Uzbekistan, said that the ongoing wars and conflicts on the planet, including inter-State, inter-ethnic, and interreligious confrontations, were among the most serious obstacles to the struggle against poverty. The confirmation for that truth could be seen in long-suffering Afghanistan. He proposed searching for alternative ways of achieving peace and stability there, among them the creation of the contact group "6+3" under the United Nations auspices, which had been proposed by Uzbekistan in 2008. This initiative was based on the idea that the problems of Afghanistan must be resolved by the Afghans themselves. The most important objectives of the group would be to propose a programme for the secession of military operations in the country, to find compromise solutions on key problems, and to render economic aid.

He said that the tragic inter-ethnic conflict in June 2010 in Kyrgyzstan, during which hundreds of people had been killed in the south of the country, constituted a serious threat to the stability of the Central Asian region. The Kyrgyz nationals and Uzbek diaspora in the south had become victims of a well-thought-out and organized action by third-party forces, which aimed to instigate chaos and create an interstate confrontation between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. His country had received more than 100,000 refugees and had not allowed the brutal violence to expand. He called for humanitarian assistance to Kyrgyzstan from the world community and an independent international inquiry and trial concerning the pogroms, murder and violence.

Mr. Karimov added that the tragedy of the drying and vanishing Aral Sea, which Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had visited earlier this year, stood as an example of the world's irresponsible attitude towards environmental problems. Calling for the preservation of the natural biological pool of the area adjacent to the Aral Sea, he proposed switching to building less dangerous but more economical, small hydropower stations on the two rivers - Amrudarya and Syrdary - to create the same energy-generating capacities. Turning to Uzbekistan's steps in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, he stated that over 50 per cent of the country's State budget was channelled annually to the social sphere. Since independence, resolute steps had been taken to radically repair the health-care system and reduce infectious diseases. The maternal mortality and child rates had decreased dramatically. He noted that, in 2008 and 2009, the growth rates of the country's economy had been 9 and 8.1 per cent, respectively, and that, in 2010, the growth rate was expected at 8.5 per cent. He praised Uzbekistan's model of democratization and transition to a free-market economy, stating that the country had rejected the methods of "shock therapy" from the outset. He also underscored that the annual expenditures for education made up 10-12 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), and emphasized Uzbekistan's support for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's global action plan to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

King MSWATI III of Swaziland drew a link between agricultural development and the eradication of extreme poverty. His country's Government had a programme in place to provide tractors, seeds and fertilizers, enabling farmers to till their land on time. More resources were needed, however, to build dams as well as boreholes for both irrigation and household use. Swaziland's aim was to ensure greater production of staple foods, as well as diversification of agricultural exports and access to new markets.

Empowering children with business skills, thus enabling them to start their own enterprises, was an aim of the school curriculum in Swaziland, he said. The country was also determined to equip its children with information and communications technology, so as to ensure that they were at par with their peers in developed countries. The country had also started to roll out free primary education to ensure that every child had access to free education by 2015.

Health had been declared a priority area in Swaziland, where hospitals and clinics were continuously being built, he said. Added to that were efforts to attract and retain local professionals, with the aim of saving on the huge cost of sending patients with complicated medical conditions abroad on referrals. Tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS, and other social impediments had hampered improvements in maternal care; Swaziland's response had been to advocate good health practices and encourage people to adopt preventative measures. A comprehensive HIV programme was to be scaled up and delivered more speedily in the coming year; there had, meanwhile, been a significant increase in access to antiretroviral therapy since 2005. Malaria, meanwhile, had entered an elimination phase after Swaziland had achieved the Goal regarding that illness. The country's best practice against malaria was contributing significantly to Southern African Development Community (SADC) efforts. He added that his country's commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals was further strengthened by the fact that its national development strategy, adopted in 1998, set the road map for becoming a developed nation.

EVO MORALES, President of Bolivia, said poverty had been seen from the viewpoint of its effects, rather than its causes. Unfair wealth distribution had created poverty and the current economic and political framework was not creating solutions to end it. "Very few of us are entitled to live in the lap of luxury," he said. To reach the Goals, the global South must stop financing the global North. It was estimated that developing countries had transferred $891 billion in 2008 and more than $500 billion in 2009 - eight times more than ODA received by developing countries, which hit $125 billion annually.

States must determine how to end such practices and invest those funds in education, health and combating poverty, he said. Investment must also be made in sport, as youth were losing their values in some societies, as well as in "harmony with Mother Earth". With that in mind, he urged nationalizing key resources and utilities so that their dividends would benefit the population. Sovereign rules for foreign investment must be devised to ensure reinvestment in national potential. "We want partners. We do not want bosses," he said. All basic services were a human right, especially water. They could not be private business.

He also suggested that a bank of the global South be established, instead of placing national resources in developed country banks, so that developing countries could finance themselves without conditions or adjustments. That would break their dependence on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In Bolivia, various social indicators had improved and there was a domestic market which created growth. Bolivia had eliminated illiteracy, thanks to South-South cooperation and he highlighted Cuba and Venezuela in that regard. The poorest 40 per cent of global population had only 5 per cent of the global income. In turn, 70 per cent of global income went to the top 5 per cent of the population. That was an unfair wealth distribution.

MWAI KIBAKI, President of Kenya, heralded the economic growth experienced in his country, which had increased from 5 per cent in 2002 to 7 per cent in 2007. Despite the slowing of growth over the last two years due to the global and economic crisis in recent times, he was optimistic about the new Constitution - with a two-tier system of national and county governance - that reflected the aspirations of the Kenyan people. He believed that it would ensure accelerated growth. The national budget committed no less that 15 per cent to counties, which was increased from 2.5 per cent previously available under the Constituency Development Fund.

He shared the tremendous strides Kenya had made towards universal education and gender parity, establishing free and compulsory education, which resulted in an increased enrolment from 5.9 million children in 2002 to 8.6 million children in 2009. In primary schools, there was now near gender parity. Further to that end, he said the new Constitution would bridge the remaining gender gaps by ensuring that 30 per cent of public appointments in Parliament and local authorities would be women.

Turning to the area of health care, he said that rates of immunization of children between the first and second years of life had been increased by 80 per cent. The expansion of public health facilities, services, campaigns and personnel also resulted in a reduction of the prevalence of HIV from 13 per cent in 1994 to 6.3 per cent in 2009. Further, 68 per cent of all households had received free treated mosquito nets in the fight against malaria. He observed the lack of significant progress in the Doha Development Agenda and the conclusion of a multilateral trading-system arrangement that delivered "real and substantial benefits to developing countries". Most developing countries had been diverting resources to achieve the Millennium Goals to service high external debts. Thus, he proposed that debt sustainability be defined in terms of a country's capacity to meet those Goals. He was confident that this meeting would "create renewed impetus and momentum" to fulfil those targets by 2015.

SHIMON PERES, President of Israel, said science, creativity and knowledge had replaced land as the source of wealth. While land could be conquered, science could not. Still, terrorists spread violence caused by ideological differences, social gaps and sheer fanaticism. But modern science was able to provide new answers and the coming 10 years would see an explosion of knowledge. He spoke on behalf of a small people and a tiny land, which had been attacked seven times in 62 years.

Despite wars, Israel had made peace with Egypt and Jordan, and had left Gaza on its own initiative, he said. Now, Israel was negotiating with the Palestinians on a way to realize the two-State solution: a Jewish State, Israel, and an Arab State, Palestine. "I believe we shall succeed," he said, noting that Israel also was ready to enter direct negotiations with Syria right away. Israel was committed to the Goals, and shared the burden of saving the world from war and hunger. Without peace, poverty would remain, and without food, peace would not prevail.

Five decades ago, an Israeli farmer produced food for 15 persons, he said; today, he produced for 120. To cultivate land, States must also cultivate education and improve health. Israel had introduced free compulsory education for all, while the national health-care system provided world-class treatment for every citizen. "Our path is available to everyone," he said, and Israel was ready to share its experience. While some had said there was no future for Israel in the Middle East, he believed the region had room for "every person, every nation, every religion". Recalling his younger days on a kibbutz, he said it was there he learned to respect pioneers. He called on delegates to harness science and technology to increase food production, and second, to stand together against terror. "A terrorized world will never be governable," he said.

ALVARO COLOM CABALLEROS, President of Guatemala, said despite his country's progress in meeting many of the Millennium Development Goals, the pace was slow, and in some cases, unsatisfactory. Addressing environmental sustainability was among the country's greatest challenges, he said, and, due to the frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters, there was a dramatic increase in cases of acute malnutrition in children. He added that indicators had shown that progress on chronic under-nutrition was "stagnant".

Despite such setbacks, however, the country had strengthened and improved its efforts to monitor and detect cases of malnutrition to achieve early intervention, and stressed it would continue to tackle these chronic problems over the next five years, he said. Thanks to new programmes offering free public health and education, Guatemala had seen the largest growth in the last fifteen years in the area of school enrolment for elementary education for boys and girls, as well as expanded access to mid-level education. It had also expanded its services in prenatal care, maternity services for women, and controlled growth and medical attention for child disease, most notably in rural areas.

While Guatemala understood the urgency of addressing the fiscal restrictions in its public sector, he expressed his hope for continued support from the international community. In closing, he reiterated his Government's determination to reach its goals by 2015, and reiterated Guatemala's commitment to continue working hand-in-hand with the global community.

King ABDULLAH II of Jordan said the Millennium Development Goals spoke to some of the most important truths of the twenty-first century: that global security and prosperity were in danger, while billions lived in want. Developing countries and donors had vital responsibilities if the Goals were to succeed. There was real work ahead to energize a fresh drive forward. Each gain would reinforce others, from better education and health care to improved living standards. By integrating such work into national and global strategies, "we can maximize change", he said. Gains could not be consolidated without ensuring conditions on which growth depended: peace, partnership and global opportunity. A developing country must own its path to development.

The foundations were in place, he said, adding that there were no one-size-fits all solutions. Developed countries had deep interests in supporting global advances and important tools to do so. Their commitment was essential in times of economic crisis. In Jordan, public-private partnerships had long been part of the country's development success, having integrated the Goals into its national strategy for structural reform.

Also, the Government had scaled up - and out - its development efforts, and today, in its schools and through its health care, Jordan was in the process of achieving the Goals. He said that Goal 2 (universal education) had been achieved. At the same time, a lack of regional peace meant that when warfare diverted resources from economic growth, economies were undermined and poverty grew. Development programmes could help build peace, but they ultimately depended on peace to succeed long term; that was why "friends of development" must be "friends of peace". The Middle East had long been denied that peace and it counted on international support to achieve it. Jordan was ready to work together to meet the Goals.

JIGMI YOEZER THINLEY, Prime Minister of Bhutan, said his country was well on its way to fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals and most would be achieved before the 2015 deadline. Other countries were showing similar progress, after reorienting the policies and resources to achieve the Goals. The current Summit would help generate the determination and means to ensure that Governments in danger of failing their people would continue to receive the technical and financial resources they needed from the international community.

"Humanity needs to get off the perilous path on which the wrongful use of GDP has set it since [...] the 1930s," he continued. It was dangerous and stupid, and not just unsustainable to endlessly pursue material growth in a world with limited natural resources and a delicately balanced ecology. China and India were now aspiring to compete in consumption with the United States. What would happen if every global citizen acquired the same voracious capacity? The rising frequency and fury of natural calamities was one indication. The current economic recession, whose bottom had not yet been seen, was another.

Some 40 years ago, he added, Bhutan had chosen to pursue a development path based on a philosophy of "gross national happiness" defined as a judicious equilibrium between gains in material comfort and spiritual growth, within a just and sustainable environment. The approach involved pursuit of four basic goals: socio-economic development that was equitable and sustainable; environmental conservation; promotion of culture; and good governance. That measure of "happiness" should be adopted as the ninth Millennium Development Goal. It would let the Goals reach beyond the poor and developing States to bind all of humanity, rich and poor, to a timeless common vision. "The inclusion of happiness as the ninth goal will confirm we are confirmed with the quality of life," he said. A broader set of outcome indicators would be the result. Those could be developed for uniform application.

JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ ZAPATERO, Prime Minister of Spain, said it was possible to fulfil the Goals in the next five years. Progress would be significant if each country fulfilled its commitments. For its part, Spain had doubled its development aid over the last five years, and it was a determining donor to the United Nations system, particularly with regards to food security and gender equality.

He went on to put forward two ways in which the Goals could be attained. First, countries had to keep up their efforts and maintain their attention on development despite the financial crisis. Spain would strive to stick to its pledge to direct 0.7 per cent of its GDP to development assistance. Second, all Governments should clearly support a tax on international financial transactions. The Government of Spain had committed itself to defending such a tax and to seeing it implemented through all international forums. It was logical that nations undertake minimum efforts via the financial system to lift millions out of extreme poverty. Spain would defend its position on that issue at the G-20, the European Union, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other organizations. With small efforts, the Goals could be met. "We have to do that and we will do that," he declared.

IGOR LUKSI?, Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, emphasized the need for "cooperation and interdependence" between Member States in order for the Millennium Development Goals to be achieved. His country's efforts to that end had shown its commitment to the Goals, including the adoption of a National Strategy of Sustainable Development in 2007 and the establishment of a National Council for Sustainable Development to ensure dialogue and partnership and support broad-based development, among others. His country, he continued, would be able to achieve almost all tasks set at the national level by the 2015 deadline.

He emphasized at the same time that Montenegro's challenges included the reduction of regional economic, social and cultural disparities, as well as the strengthening of the rule of law and expanding gender equality, to name a few. Furthermore, because of its location, biodiversity and a growing tourist destination, environmental issues were of great concern. Sustainable use of resources was thus a priority in efforts to reach Montenegro's Millennium targets. Through regional and global integration, political stability and economic prosperity would support achievement of the Goals. He supported the European Union's commitment to increase aid to developing countries, with a focus on sub-Saharan and least developed nations.

VICTOR BODIU, Minister of State of the Republic of Moldova, said his country had integrated the Millennium Development Goals in its national development strategy and sectoral plans, with clear and measurable targets. It had also set performance evaluation indicators for national policies. Two weeks ago, the country had launched the Second National MDG Report, which presented an accurate analysis of achievements and set the targets and objectives to be reached by 2015. In the past several years, the Republic of Moldova had registered a mixed, but overall positive, progress in reaching the Goals. The majority of indicators showed advancements, even though, in certain areas, the intensity was still not sufficient to attain all the set targets. "Despite the fact that Moldova is still recovering from the global economic crisis and has been severely hit by floods in July 2010, the Government of Moldova is committed to sustain the achieved targets and gradually accelerate its actions to reach all national targets by 2015," he said. The country's leadership had a vision, ownership and determination to make that possible.

The Government was currently working on a national acceleration plan for the Millennium Development Goals that would transform the recommendations of the Second National Report into concrete actions, he said. It was determined to promote sectoral policies to target fields with less successful indicators in terms of Millennium Development Goals attainability. The Republic of Moldova's key priorities were to improve health education in schools; ensure wider coverage of the social protection network; expand environmental sustainability programmes; optimize school and hospital infrastructure and ensure better social inclusion of vulnerable groups; expand multisectoral partnerships and intensify concrete actions to fights HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis; and improve water and sanitation. Migration had a massive impact on the development process in the Republic of Moldova and the Government gave careful consideration to its negative impact, along with the huge economic benefits of remittances.

MICHELINE CALMY-REY, Federal Councillor of Switzerland, said that, while the beginning of the new millennium had been a splendid time in history, when virtually nothing appeared impossible, even achieving the greater global challenge of all - reduced poverty - that euphoria was today slightly tempered. Progress in reducing the number of poor people worldwide, in access to primary education and drinking water, and in gender equality was still insufficient. The international community needed to address a number of questions about development. Were donor countries on the wrong track? Were they not doing enough? Did the international production and trade system still work against poor countries?

She noted that the majority of the countries and regions which were off track in achieving the Millennium Development Goals were characterized by fragility of State institutions, conflict or armed violence, and that measures needed to be taken to ensure the provision of basic services and the proper functioning of national institutions. To achieve the Millennium Development Goals, she called for mutual accountability among countries; respect for human rights and the right for all social groups, namely women and minorities, to participate; the creation of economic foundations for the improved well-being of all, including a place in the production process and global trade; as well as the rule of law in the private sector, and appropriate taxation for both enterprises and individuals.

She also noted that climate change had become a core issue in the development debate, and the task of adapting to climate change would be a vital part in efforts concerning the developing countries, since changing climates could trigger enforced migration and spill over into conflicts over water and arable land. Greater efforts should be made to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and to achieve the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. She concluded that international cooperation was facing major changes, since the limits of what was ecologically sustainable would soon be reached, and that the equitable distribution of resources and the transition to a green economy were more necessary than ever. Further, the international community needed to debate more openly and directly the reasons why development was stagnating, and then set its objectives accordingly.

BHIM BAHADUR RAWAL, Minister for Home Affairs, Nepal, noted that the least developed countries lagged "starkly" behind in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, yet the Goals could not be achieved without those countries. Nepal's own efforts had resulted in the Goals fully integrated into national development policies and programmes. However, without enhanced and additional support from the international community, those targets would not be met.

There were successful national programmes, he stated, including partnership for poverty eradication, community management of schools and forests, and maternal-health-related programmes, to name a few. Still, poverty and hunger continued to challenge development, and he noted the need for innovated approaches and equity in sharing of global resources, among others. "The business-as-usual approach will not be sufficient to address the root causes and multidimensional aspects of development challenges," he said.

Being landlocked and least developed, Nepal faced additional difficulties, such as the disproportionate impact of climate changes from the melting of glaciers in the Himalayas, among others. Because their high vulnerability and deep structural constraints, Nepal and other least developed countries were different from other countries in their ability to reach the Millennium Development Goals, and he urged the international community to give priority consideration while making decisions on international support measures and resource allocations. National leadership and ownership of development were key in achieving sustainable development, he said in conclusion, but "there is no substitute for a stronger global partnership".

KASIT PIROMYA, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand, recalled the profound changes in circumstances over the past decade, including the food, fuel and financial crises, which had rolled back development efforts. Climate change had proved a threat to people's security as well, and it was obvious that humankind faced one of its most crucial junctures. The next five years would see a number of benchmarks relating to sustainable development, including the climate change negotiations and the Rio+20 Conference; those "jigsaw puzzles" had to be pulled together, so as to achieve internationally agreed development goals in a sustainable manner.

He said good governance was crucial in ensuring that people benefited from development strategies. Further, the development agenda must be people-centred and it was critical to enhance international cooperation. It was also important to ensure the sustainability of development progress. Thought should go into achieving the Goals in a more strategic manner, for example by setting goals such as the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger as immediate targets. Achieving some goals first could ease the way to achieving others. In addition, for the long term, it was crucial to proceed further from the Goals towards sustainable development.

CHRISTIAN ONYEBUCHI CHUKWA, Minister of Health of Nigeria, speaking on behalf of his country's President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, noted the opportunity of the Summit to redirect the global agenda towards the ultimate realization of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Nigeria had, since 2000, mainstreamed Millennium Development Goal-related programmes into its development and budgeting process, which, he noted, had been assisted by its negotiations on debt relief. Further, targets had also been integrated into medium- and long-term national development strategies, along with the implementation of new initiatives to reduce poverty and improve public service. All those efforts were in service of meeting the Goals and placing Nigeria among "the top 20 economies of the world by 2020".

In his overview of Nigeria's efforts, however, he noted that, despite its strong determination, progress had been mixed and significant challenges remained. Sustained economic growth and improvements in agricultural yields with its ensuing impact on children's health were clear indicators of success. Yet the rates in poverty reduction had not been sufficient. Nigeria was reasonably on course to reach the Goal on the reduction in child mortality. However, for most of the early years of the Goals, Nigeria had had one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. More recent data showed considerable progress, and Nigeria, committed to making faster progress, had deployed almost 2,500 midwives since 2009 to raise the number of births attended by skilled health workers.

Innovation and improvement in governance, accountability and policy would aid in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, he said, but additional support was required. To rise to those challenges, a new five-year countdown strategy - road map to accelerate Nigeria's progress, linked to the medium- and long-term visions, had been implemented. He was confident, he said in conclusion, that by working more efficiently and in a better coordinated way with its partners, Nigeria would achieve its goals and he called for the support of the international community.

PATTI LONDONO-JARAMILLO, Vice-Minister of Multilateral Affairs of Colombia, said the Millennium Development Goals had been integrated into her country's strategies for poverty reduction and President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon would be showcasing the country's achievements as one of three countries presenting their progress at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) special activity related to acceleration frameworks. She highlighted that Colombia had had an increase of more than 2.5 million students in the basic educational system, allowing the country to reach universal coverage in the last seven years.

She shared Columbia's experience in the Alta Guajira bringing comprehensive social progress to the Wayuu indigenous community, a process involving the community, local and regional authorities and the national Government. Within a three-year period, with a total investment of $40 million and administrative costs of only 0.77 per cent, Colombia had transformed the lives of 100,000 people, solving problems of safe drinking water, education, health, citizen registration and clean energy, she said.

She invited the United Nations to join Colombia in a pilot programme in 20 municipalities, based on a common strategy and using the experience applied in the Alta Guajira. Colombia would like to implement local development projects with high social impact. It believed in a systemic approach with measures and policies that attained solutions to problems such as water, housing, education, health, citizenship registration and energy, and was ready to share its local development methodology.

KHALID ABDALRAZAQ AL-NAFISEE ( Saudi Arabia) drew attention to the relationship between the Millennium Development Goals and sustainable development, and harmony between local and international partners. Achieving the Goals would require a strengthening of infrastructure that would involve a broader participation of women in the economy, reducing unemployment, enhancing technology and telecommunications, and building an environment conducive to the participation of all, including youth and women.

Saudi Arabia was ahead of schedule in implementing the Goals, he said. Important progress had been made in eliminating extreme poverty. Saudi Arabia had also extended help to people around the world as much as it could, based on its humanitarian convictions; 1.5 per cent of its GDP had gone towards ODA, making it one of the biggest international aid donors. Such aid included loans, gifts, emergency relief and debt forgiveness, he said.

IVO JOSIPOVI?, President of Croatia, said the Millennium Declaration laid the foundation for global partnership for development. That partnership should be fostered by a spirit of shared responsibility and solidarity. Today's plenary meeting to assess what would be needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in the remaining years, he stressed, must factor in trends that seriously impeded current efforts.

Issues such as national-turned-global crises and poverty levels were important warnings to avoid being further derailed from the collective promises made. Over the past two years, substantial efforts had been made towards curtailing the decline of national gross domestic product and create preconditions for initiating a new cycle for development. However, that process was not immune from serious social implications. Current trends such as unemployment and social stresses on populations continued to hinder global efforts. Given that, he underscored the importance of reaching an agreement as to how best to implement the Millennium Goals in the future. That, in his mind, was the imperative for today's meeting.

Croatia, he noted, remained fully committed to the full implementation of the Millennium Goals at the national and global level. Highlighting progress made in Croatia, he said his country was contending with multiple economic difficulties that had caused declines in growth, development, and employment. He was confident Croatia would soon become the twenty-eighthmember of the European Union and, driven by European ideals, had invested significant resources in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In its transition from a war-torn country, Croatia had embarked on a path of difficult recovery, which had lasted 18 years. It had dealt with numerous problems and, by its own efforts, began a path to reconciliation and development. He also noted some of his country's donor activities, aimed at sharing knowledge and experiences with other countries. In closing, he stressed that "as world leaders, we must not spare any effort in finding viable, durable and affordable solutions for all".

HAMAD BIN KHALIFA AL-THANI, Emir of Qatar, said the global economic crisis had had a negative impact on the international community's efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in poor developing countries. Development assistance diminished and foreign direct investment receded. Achievement of the Goals at the global level was uneven. Although some countries had made remarkable achievements, many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, had not reached the targets of most Millennium Development Goals. The achievement of all internationally agreed development goals depended primarily on the essence of the global partnership.

He said the achievement of the Goals required that each of the parties carry out its duty. Developing countries must adopt comprehensive national strategies, promote good governance, fight corruption and create an attractive environment for investment. Developed countries should undertake reforms to ensure stability of the international financial system, reduce trade distortions and issue timetables regarding their commitment. The delay in the negotiations of the Doha Round had caused huge disappointment for developing countries. Countries involved in the negotiations should focus on establishing a multilateral trade system characterized by openness, fairness and non-discrimination.

He said that Qatar had realized most of the Millennium Development Goals and was on track to achieve all of them by 2015. The Qatar National Vision 2030 had emphasized four pillars to address all Millennium Development Goals: human development; social development; economic development; and environmental development. The country had been a partner in supporting efforts to combat poverty and disseminate the fruits of global growth in a more equitable manner. It had also stressed the commitment for allocating the specified percentage of gross national income as development aid. Development aid, outside of contributions to United Nations funds, had reached $382 million in 2009. In promoting international cooperation, he mentioned Qatar's hosting of the 2001 Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, which had resulted in the Doha Round, the South Summit in 2005 and the Conference for New or Restored Democracies in 2006.

KING MOHAMMED VI, King of Morocco, noted that the question on everyone's mind was what specific goals have been achieved under the Millennium Declaration. Today's meeting should be used to make an objective assessment and devise strategies to achieve the Millennium Goals by 2015. Responsibilities in that regard should be shouldered collectively, he stressed. The Millennium Goals must take centre stage in national policies, particularly within developing nations. In 2005, his country launched the National Initiative for Human Development. The Initiative's projects sought to address shortcomings in social development efforts by creating jobs and income-generating activities.

As credit to the Initiative, Morocco had progressed well towards achieving the Millennium Goals. Headway had been made, particularly with regard to poverty eradication and improving living conditions in both rural and urban areas. Moreover, his country had made noteworthy progress in its sovereign decision regarding gender equity in family, health, school and job market issues. Continuing, he highlighted progress made in protecting the environment, combating climate change and promoting sustainable development.

To promote a global partnership based on solidarity, Morocco had made human development and achieving the Millennium Goals central to its South-South cooperation policy, especially with regard to its sister African countries. He stressed that a firm political commitment made by all countries, and supported by a global, specific partnership mechanism with a clear implementation table, was the best guarantee for achieving the Millennium Goals. It was also important, however, to anticipate potential future problems and begin considering the broad line of global actions beyond 2015.

EMOMALI RAHMON, President of Tajikistan, stated that, as one of the eight pilot countries identified for the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, the country had already considerably reduced poverty as a result of the implementation of its national development plan. In addition, the number of children attending elementary and high schools had increased and the quality of social services had improved, as the country had channelled about half of the Government's budget to the social sector, mainly to education and health care.

He highlighted several priorities in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Reform of the international finance system, for example, should focus on creating favourable external conditions and strengthening global partnership. An increased share of renewable energies at the global level and transfer of new and advanced technologies would provide access to energy and energy efficiency, mitigating climate change. Tajikistan had a number of hydropower stations under construction, not only for generating energy, but for irrigation, which was important for all of Central Asia.

"Water is a vitally important resource that unites all MDGs," he said. He emphasized that the recommendations of the Dushanbe Declaration on Water, which had been approved by over 75 countries, could be a worthy contribution to the action agenda for the Millennium Development Goals. Highlighting the significant disparity in the development of the developed and developing countries, he called for increased measures to strengthen global partnership.

ABDULLAH GUL, President of Turkey, announced that his country was "well on its way" towards achieving the Goals, having adopted them as its primary national development targets and integrated them into its development plans. Because of solid financial resources, comprehensive social welfare programmes, which improved quality of life for vulnerable populations, were now sustainable. With direct payments to mothers, 100 per cent enrolment of girls in primary school was on track. A new social security system was ensuring that Turkish citizens received universal health coverage, and measures for environmental sustainability had been introduced into policy, to name a few initiatives.

He added that development issues were now an integral part of Turkey's foreign policy agenda, with a focus on least developed countries, particularly through technology and know-how transfer. Turkey's ODA had increased to more than $1.5 billion annually. Turkey was preparing to host, once again, the United Nations Conference on the least developed countries, which he hoped would generate strong political momentum and new partnerships to address the "persistent challenges" of those countries, as well as demonstrate that Turkey had become a reliable partner for development. "While we may not have too much time left for progress toward the MDGs, we certainly have the will and capacity to achieve them," he said, urging the international community to "act now and act swiftly".

Equal importance must be attached to each and every Goal, he said, outlining several guidelines drawn from Turkey's own experience as an emerging economy, including that the overarching objective must remain the eradication of poverty and hunger. Also, strategies should be adopted in favour of the poor and vulnerable, and investment in agriculture was essential to ensure food security. He also pressed for progress on gender equality and women's empowerment and favoured more emphasis on education and health. Environmental sustainability with stronger political commitment and action should also be pursued, he said. In addition, mutually reinforcing relations among the notions of democracy, development and security should be acknowledged.

CHOUMMALY SAYASONE, President of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, said progress had been made over the past 10 years in implementing the Goals at the global level. At the country level, however, the wide gap in implementation among countries had grown due to crises created by global climate change and economic turmoil. With five years left to achieve the Goals, the Summit should focus on the best practices and lessons learned so that countries could adopt concrete measures to accelerate implementation and achieve the Goals.

He said that his country had adopted a National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy in 2003, which had been streamlined into a National Social-Economic Development Plan for 2006-2010. Those strategies had laid a strong foundation for making progress towards achieving the Goals. The annual economic growth rate, for example, was expected to increase to 7 per cent in the 2006-2010 period over the 6.2 per cent of the previous five-year period. That would reduce poverty to 26 per cent in 2009 from the 48 per cent recorded in 1990. Social and cultural improvements had been made in education, reduction in infant and maternal mortality rates, and in raising the status of women.

To achieve the Goals, he urged intensified mobilization of resources from both internal and external sources to advance key sectors. Those included the development of human resource capacity, the improvement of education, and the development of infrastructure, particularly in areas related to transportation and communication linkages.

BINGU WA MUTHARIKA, President of Malawi, applauded African Governments for their "heroic efforts" to meet the Millennium Goals by 2015. Malawi, for its part, was confident about meeting all eight Millennium Goals in varying degrees, as it had fully embraced the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy. That strategy focused on nine priority areas: agriculture and food security; green belt irrigation and water development; transport and infrastructure development; education, science and technology; energy, mining and industrial development; integrated rural development; climate change, natural resources and environmental management; youth development and empowerment; and public health, sanitation and HIV/AIDS management.

Of the Millennium Goals, those related to universal primary education, reducing gender inequality and reducing maternal mortality required more concerted efforts to achieve. The remaining five Goals would definitely be achieved, he said. With regard to universal primary education, his Government had undertaken several efforts, including expanding teacher training colleges, constructing more classrooms and scaling up school feeding programmes. Turning to maternal health, he noted that, in order to reduce the number of deaths per live births, Malawi was constructing and upgrading health facilities. Those efforts were aimed to offer essential health services, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

Considerable progress had been achieved in the promotion of gender equality and women's empowerment. Women currently held more high positions within the country. Further, his country was taking affirmative action to increase women in decision-making positions in both the public and private sectors. Through such measures, Malawi's commitment to achieving the Millennium Goals could be seen. Speaking for Africa as a whole, he urged for the United Nations to review supply side issues. Such a review would assist in improving access to services for ordinary people, especially women and children, as envisioned within the Goals. "We need teaching and learning materials, we need school feeding programmes, we need extensive immunization. These need to be produced to push the [Millennium Goal] agenda."

GURBANGULY BERDIMUHAMEDOV, President of Turkmenistan, stated that the country remained committed to neutrality. Issues of economic cooperation were of particular importance for Turkmenistan, and a strategic priority for it in that regard was diversification of energy routes and provision of a new, multi-operational pipeline infrastructure. Highlighting several projects and initiatives, he pointed to the recent construction of Turkmenistan-China and Turkmenistan-Iran pipelines and active work under way on implementing a Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, convinced that it would benefit all parties involved. Currently, issues of equal, uninterrupted and secure access to energy sources and means of their transportation had assumed global importance. In that connection, Turkmenistan intended to initiate a General Assembly resolution to create an expert group, under United Nations auspices, that would develop an international mechanism for stable energy supply.

Since the world community understood that the problem of a globally secure and reliable transit of energy carriers required multilateral discussion, he suggested the possible creation of a United Nations energy council to provide a political format and organizational conditions for a systematic discussion of the range of energy-related problems. He called on Member States to formulate their suggestions in light of that initiative. He enlisted the aid of the United Nations, particularly the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), to develop transport and communication infrastructure in Central Asia and the Caspian basin, ensuring effective cooperation and investment flow in north-south and east-west directions.

As the pivotal component of achieving the Millennium Development Goals in the region was solving the serious ecological problems, namely, saving the Aral Sea and rehabilitating the unique natural resources of the Caspian Sea, he encouraged the establishment of a regional office of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), as well as the creation of a special international expert group to prepare an international legal document to save the Aral Sea.

BORIS TADI?, President of Serbia, stated that significant, if uneven, progress had been made despite the financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices, and climate change and the loss of biodiversity. He was confident that Serbia, which has made poverty reduction an integral part of its efforts to join the European Union, would meet all eight Goals by 2015. Measures had been taken to ensure that the prices of basic food items could never again be manipulated by speculators; emphasis was also being put on equality of opportunity, gender equality and empowerment of women and minorities. Significant investments in health care and education had begun to pay off.

He said that integral to Serbia's efforts had been environmental sustainability through innovative financing at the national and regional levels. A good example of that was the Belgrade Initiative for Enhancing Sub-Regional Cooperation in the Field of Climate Change through Research and Systemic Observation, Education, Training, Public Awareness and Capacity-Building. Covering the costs had become more difficult, however, and the solution to that problem could lay in a decentralized system of environmental financing, as well as in finding ways to upgrade environmental infrastructure and monitoring systems. The only efficient way for humankind to address the numerous challenges of modern civilization is through the investment of each and every country in science, innovation and education, in synergy with politics and the economy.

MOMPATI MERAFHE, Vice-President of Botswana, said the enthusiasm shown during the 2005 Millennium Development Goals review had not translated into the desired results. Many developing countries still lagged behind in most targets. It was necessary to do everything possible to fulfil pledges made and to eradicate poverty. Botswana's President had set a road map to prosperity for all, which was underpinned by the quest for human development and dignity. Botswana's commitment to the Millennium Development Goals was amplified in the 2010-2016 National Development Plan. Botswana had made some progress towards erasing poverty, which had fallen from 47 per cent in 1993 to 23 per cent in 2009. But no level of poverty was tolerable, he said, stressing the need to give old age pensioners, destitute people, orphans, and homebound people access to food, education and subsistence allowance. Recognizing that the fight against poverty must be sustained, Botswana's Government adopted a broad-based growth programme aimed at creating opportunities for sustainable livelihoods by investing in and strengthening institutions.

Botswana continued to commit significant resources to literacy and skills developments, he said. It had achieved near-universal primary education, with more than 95 per cent of children aged 7 to 13 enrolled in primary school. It had also made strides in health care. The percentage of mothers attended to by trained health professionals had remained at about 98 per cent since 1998. He noted significant progress in stemming the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In 2005, 62 per cent of people with HIV received treatment; today more than 90 per cent received antiretroviral therapy. But, Botswana continued to face challenges in maternal and infant mortality. Water was a scarce commodity in Botswana, but the Government had been able to provide potable water to more than 95 per cent of the population since 2000.

One of the greatest global challenges was climate change, he said. Its impact was being felt worldwide. Left unattended, it would continue to impede development and poverty eradication. To respond to it, Botswana had set up a National Climate Change Committee to oversee national policies on climate change and implementation of activities related to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At the 2000 World Summit, leaders pledged to strengthen the United Nations in order to enhance its authority and efficiency. The Organization should be given the necessary support to respond to development challenges. More support was needed for small island developing States, least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. On their own, they lacked the capacity to mitigate development challenges. He supported an action-oriented outcome at the end of the high-level Millennium Development Goals meeting.

JOSE RAMOS-HORTA, President of Timor-Leste, said that, while many countries had been guided by the Millennium Development Goals to improve social and economic conditions, fragile and post-conflict nations had been less fortunate. The unique challenges they faced had not been included in the Goals. "I am here to inform you that despite our combined efforts, we must be realistic now, here, today, that fragile and post conflict affected states are the farthest away from meeting the MDGS and they most likely will not be met under the time frame the architects intended," he said, speaking as a representative of the G7+, a group of fragile post-conflict States that advocated a new paradigm as a means of meeting the Millennium Development Goals by placing peacebuilding and state-building at the forefront of international engagement.

He said his country had adopted a reformist agenda that tailored to the diverse historical, linguistic, geographic, political and cultural landscapes. Imported ideas had been substituted with home-grown ones. International expertise had been contextualized with local innovation and domestic knowledge. The nation had implemented key peacebuilding and state-building functions. For the first time, it had adopted socially compassionate policies, pensions for the elderly, disabled and veterans, and had returned some 150,000 internally displaced persons to their homes. "Above all, dialogue replaced discord," he said, adding that incredible progress had been made.

He noted that, between 1999 and 2007, some $8 billion had been allocated by the international community, but that during the period poverty had increased. Since 2007, his Government had reversed that trend by making public spending a cornerstone to ease suffering, spur economic growth and consolidate a newfound level of stability. Now, averaging three years of consistent double-digit economic growth, Timor-Leste had been cited as one of the top 10 fastest growing economies. Non-oil per capita income had increased from $398 in 2007 to $599 in 2009. The Millennium Development Goals targets for infant mortality and under-five mortality had been reached. School enrolment had increased to 83 per cent. By 2015 some Goals would have been met and most could be met if there was a change in the way aid was delivered. "We must trust in the practices and principles of the Paris declaration and the Accra Agenda, with ownership and harmonization at the forefront first by the principles of peacebuilding and state-building [...]," he said. "We must now make the collective decision to move from fragility to agility, and do this with the same vigour and effort that the MDGs were originally asserted."

NGUYEN MINH TRIET, President of Viet Nam, said his country had achieved some Goals ahead of schedule and was on track to attaining the remaining ones on time. The strategy was to localize the Goals and mainstream them into development policies and programmes at all levels. Promoting participation was key, as was overall reform and international support. Nevertheless, Viet Nam was still underdeveloped, and living standards remained low, particularly in remote communities and those devastated by war and by agent orange/dioxin. Furthermore, implementation of the Goals in the 10 years since their adoption had been hampered by global conditions, including unilateralism and use of force, tensions in parts to the world, the recent global economic crisis, volatility in energy and food security and, finally, the impacts of climate change.

In addition to supporting the solutions and measures as defined in the action agenda to be adopted during the current meeting, he said three points warranted emphasis. First, peace and security were prerequisites for development and, therefore, it was a common responsibility to support actions favouring the peaceful settlement of disputes. Second, cooperation must continue to expand to creating favourable international conditions to assist developing countries in policymaking and strengthening management capacity. Among others, developed countries must deliver on their obligations and commitments, including in maintaining macroeconomic stability, successfully completing the Doha trade round and eliminating unfair trade measures.

Finally, he said the current meeting should be followed up with early development of international and national implementation programmes to sustain progress and even strive for higher goals. Based on the experience of the past 10 years, a new opportunity was now present for a full recognition of the importance of multilateral cooperation, with the United Nations at its centre.

HIFIKEPUNYE POHAMBA, President of Namibia, noted with concern the uneven progress of some countries in achieving the Millennium Goals, as well as unresolved challenges. Namibia, recognizing at the outset how daunting achieving the Goals would be, integrated the task into its national development programmes and policies. National targets and indicators were also created to monitor progress made. His country had recorded progress in many areas, despite the onset of global crises, natural disasters, and the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. However, progress was less robust with regard to sanitation in rural areas.

Namibia's Government placed high importance on providing education and training to its people. The largest percentage of the national budget had been consistently allocated into the education sector over the years. It was on course to achieving universal primary education. Turning to gender parity, he happily noted that his country had exceeded the target with regard to enrolment ratios for girls' to boys' schools. While progress in reducing the infant mortality rate had been slow, progress had been made in maternal mortality. Complications from HIV/AIDS had become the main cause of death in Namibia. However, a significant decline in the number of new infections was the result of ongoing country-wide public awareness campaigns.

Malaria had been contained through the distribution of free insecticide-treated mosquito nets. Furthermore, treatment and awareness campaigns had lead to recorded progress in treating tuberculosis cases, especially from 1996 to 2006. Despite efforts and progress made, Namibia faced declining international development assistance. This was due to the country's classification as a middle-income country, he noted. In that regard, he appealed to Bretton Woods and other international financial institutions to create special mechanisms to enable middle income countries to access financial resources for development on concessional terms. Highlighting the need to strengthen the global partnership for development, he urged development cooperation partners to honour their obligations.

Prince Albert II of Monaco, recalling the world's commitment in 2000 towards a new era and to spare no effort to combat poverty, asked how could it be that women still died today in labour due to a lack of care and that children still died of hunger. Peace and security in the world would only be attained if sustainable development was guaranteed for all. Five years before the deadline for achieving the millennium targets, it was time to seize the opportunity to attain them. Achievement of the targets in primary education and the fight against HIV/AIDS was still feasible. The international community should redouble its efforts and reaffirm the fundamental values of liberty, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. For its part, Monaco was committed to international development cooperation policy. Its ODA would meet the target of 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2015.

He said that Monaco's aid had increased fivefold since 2000 and by 25 per cent annually. It was provided purely in the form of grants and targeted towards partner countries, mainly least developed countries, in areas of health, education, the environment and microeconomics. Poverty was unacceptable. Today, one child in four in the developing world was underweight, and almost 1 billion people lacked daily access to water. He called on the international community to seize the opportunity at this crucial stage to equip itself with the means to reach the global commitments. Monaco would continue to mobilize emergency aid to address natural disasters and climate change.

The new millennium had awakened new hopes, which had been partially dashed by threats to mankind and the environment, he said. During the forthcoming meeting on biodiversity, the international community must recall the importance of preserving a sustainable way of life. He pledged his personal commitment to devising innovative and ethical solutions to biodiversity and water management concerns. It was necessary to complete the groundwork for " Rio + 20". The millennium targets would only be attained if they were sustainable. Everyone must be involved and associated with the decisions. That was the focus of the "G-3", with which Monaco was associated. Each speaker today was convinced of the urgency to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Now was the time for action.

MIKHEIL SAAKASHVILI, President of Georgia, noted that there had been significant changes in how best to approach the achievement of the Millennium Goals since 2005. Of those changes, a focus on innovative financial mechanisms and local ownership were of the utmost importance. Money was, of course, needed to achieve the Goals; however, "aid money will not deliver concrete results unless due attention is paid to local ownership". He highlighted several examples of how aid funds given to local officials were misused and not distributed to the people. With that in mind, it was clear that corruption was synonymous with local ownership in some countries. Thus, the real aim of local ownership should be to encourage and reinforce responsible governance.

He said that the local ownership issue had seemingly become a "chicken and the egg" dilemma, which demanded clear vision and dedication. Georgia's own experience had underscored the need for capacity-building and efforts to combat corruption. Defeating corruption might not be an official Millennium Development Goal, but it was a prerequisite for any meaningful progress. Georgia had previously been a failed State, overcome by systemic corruption. Billions of dollars in aid had amounted to almost nothing, as funds were often allocated based on bribes rather than merit. However, the country's 2003 Rose Revolution had successfully "changed the playing field", helping Georgia to confront its corruption issues.

In the years that followed, his country had made progress towards achieving the Millennium Goals. Georgia had experienced rapid economic development and job creation. Poverty rates had dropped drastically, from 42 per cent in 2003 to less than 18 per cent so far in 2010. Extreme poverty rates had declined from 18 per cent to 6 per cent within the same time period. Such progress was "an invitation to continue our work", he said. Georgia's current success would not have been possible without the Millennium Goals and the path towards achieving them. With the Goals in place, it was easier to form global partnerships. When corruption destroyed a nation, people worried about their survival, with little time to dream of a better future. Speaking on their behalf, he emphasized the importance of combating corruption through the next five years and beyond.

AHMED ABDALLAH SAMBI, President of the Comoros, said collective and national efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals had led to some progress, but many problems remained and some had even been exacerbated. The Comoros had achieved remarkable success in some of the millennium targets despite its difficult socio-economic situation, especially the lack of resources and investment budget. There were still great delays in achieving the targets related to primary education and health care for children. Primary school enrolment rates, however, had risen from 63 per cent to 72 per cent between 1991 and 2008, and primary school graduation rates had increased from 41 per cent to 57 per cent over the same period. The infant mortality rate had dropped from 130 per 1,000 live births to 66 per 1,000 live births between 1991 and 2007. The mortality rate for children less than 1 year old had declined from 86 per 1,000 live births to 49 per 1,000 live births over the same period.

He said his country had great hope of achieving the targets with minimum support from partners, but it would be very difficult to achieve the employment and environment targets. Poor implementation was exacerbated by the lack of financing and institutional capacity. Turning to climate change, he stressed the need for viable plans to save the world, particularly for the small island developing States, which were at risk for being submerged due to rising sea level. By 2025, sea level rise in the Comoros could displace a large part of the population and destroy some economic infrastructure. According to 2003 forecasts, the availability of water per inhabitant would drop, as 63 of the nation's 175 rivers were expected to dry up. In the last 30 years, annual temperature had risen 1 Celsius on average, leading to adverse consequences for socio-economic development, as well as to an increase in malaria and other infectious diseases.

That situation had also had a potentially dramatic impact on security and tourism, the country's leading economic engines, he said. The Comoros had enormous potential in hydroelectric, solar, wind energy and geothermal resources. Financial and technical aid would help improve their development and the country's socioeconomic well-being. The poor track record towards achieving the millennium targets stemmed largely from inadequate financing for development. The poorest and most vulnerable countries had limited access to development aid, and the Comoros had limited domestic resources. Programmes to expedite achievement of the Millennium Goals, therefore, seemed "surreal". However, the Comoros was prioritizing an ambitious plan of action to achieve them.

GJORGE IVANOV, President of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, said the world was slowly coming out of the global economic crisis. The progress in the eradication of extreme poverty was slow, and conflicts, food insecurity and an increase in inequality between countries and regions were other challenges being faced, as well as the rapid increase in the number and intensity of natural and man-caused disasters. Immediate actions should, therefore, be taken, with the necessary and strong political will. The south-east European region had made tangible progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals during a period in which it was recovering from traumatic events. Guided by the idea of a common future in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), with fresh memories of dark period of conflict, the region had begun to move towards prosperous regional cooperation.

He said that his country had made progress in areas such as reducing health risks, expanding education and improving the environment. Little progress had been made in the areas of poverty and development partnership, partially because of action taken by one European Union and NATO member State. His country was hindered in economic development by its immediate neighbour because of the name of his country. Fifteen years after the first trade embargo from Greece, it was facing a new blockade. Although Greece was one of the biggest investors in his country, the blockades in the integration process indirectly blocked attracting other investors and investments. He believed, however, that soon a solution with his neighbour would be found that would ensure the country's European and Euro-Atlantic future.

He said that his country remained committed to reducing poverty and social exclusion with a national strategy for social inclusion. Special attention in that regard was dedicated to the Roma community through the "2005-2015 Roma Inclusion Decade". The Roma population had its own local self-government, schools, media and everything that constituted the normal life of a community. The Roma had representatives in Parliament, Government and in all State administration mechanisms. Also, his Government believed the key to individual success and social progress lay in comprehensive education. Therefore, both primary and secondary school were mandatory and investments in education were increased each day.

JENS STOLTENBERG, Prime Minister of Norway, said that 10 years ago, world leaders had made concrete commitments to reduce poverty and to provide access to education, health and other basic services. There were five years left to make good on those promises. Progress had been made, but it was still lagging. The task was made even more challenging by the global financial crisis, climate change and the international food crisis. Moreover, many countries had defaulted on their promises. More than 1 per cent of Norway's gross national income had been allocated to development assistance, and the country was committed to retaining that level.

He called on developing countries to mobilize more of their domestic resources by broadening their tax base, fighting corruption and increasing transparency, and improving accountability. Illicit financial flows from developing countries were estimated to be more than six times the total annual development assistance. That drain on vital resources for development must be stopped. Norway had taken on special responsibility for the goals of reducing child mortality and improving maternal health, as those were lagging behind the most. They were within reach, however, if the world made an extra effort. That was why Norway had tripled its aid for global health over the past 10 years.

Norway had worked with a network of global leaders to develop effective policies for maternal and child health, he said, urging partner countries to do their part. To access new and additional resources, they must develop their own health systems and deliver basic services to their own citizens. He called on all leaders to support the Secretary-General's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health, with concrete political and financial commitments. The Millennium Development Goals could not be seen in isolation from climate change, armed conflict and women's empowerment. The poorest countries and peoples, who had contributed least to climate change, would suffer most. Regions affected by armed conflict had made the least progress. The single most important catalyst for change was women's empowerment. "We must honour our solemn promises made 10 years ago here in New York," he concluded.

TUILA'EPA SAILELE MALIELEGAOI, Prime Minister of Samoa, opened by saying that the Millennium Declaration was a collective reaffirmation that all people deserved to live in dignity and freedom from the dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. The Millennium Development Goals represented a vision of concrete, measurable achievement. The Goals had been at the top of the development agenda for a decade; the level of achievement varied among countries, and it would be a mistake at this time to be defensive or assign blame for failures if some of the countries were not on track to meeting the targets.

Stressing that postponing those targets should not be an option, he declared that the next five years were vital. Samoa was committed to achieving the Goals by 2015. The Goals, by their very nature, were a restatement of his own people's development needs and hopes. From this point forward, Samoa needed to work hard to maintain gains and improve performance. Among those was reducing the proportion of the population living below the basic needs poverty line and ensuring expanded coverage, including to promote children's health. Additionally, greater emphasis would be given to strengthening a rights-based approach to facilitate women's universal access to reproductive health services.

The global recession and other natural and man-made crises constrained the efforts to achieve the Goals, despite political will, he said. The aftermath of the tsunami in Samoa had also affected related efforts. However, support from the international community ensured that recovery was back on track. He noted that the United Nations would review the Mauritius Strategy, which provided a comprehensive blueprint to address the national and regional sustainable development of small island developing States. He warned that isolation of those nations remained an impediment to the growth of their economies. Overcoming their remoteness would enhance the islands' resilience to the many challenges.

YVES LETERME, Prime Minister of Belgium, outlined four messages pertaining to human development and poverty eradication, stating that it was not just a matter of economic growth, but of "putting people at the centre of development". Poverty was much more than a lack of income and material wealth. It also related to social and cultural exclusion and denial of fundamental rights. Putting people at the centre of development was giving access to education and culture. His second message was an alarm signal: a major stumbling block on the road towards achieving the Millennium Goals was growing inequality, between countries and within countries themselves. A country might progress globally while some population groups, such as the underprivileged, women, and rural populations - were worse off in relative, and even in absolute, terms. Indeed, gender disparities were at the very heart of the inequality issue, and tackling inequalities was "the priority amongst priorities", he said.

The third message, he said, was that concrete progress in the field of the Millennium Goals was not only a matter of financial means, but also a matter, first and foremost, of political will and good governance, nationally. His fourth message was one of collective responsibility and of the global partnership called for in the Millennium Declaration. The logic of global partnership had led most donor countries to commit themselves to 0.7 per cent ODA, a target which his Government had reconfirmed in its 2010 budget. Belgium was also working hard to raise awareness on forging consensus on innovative financing, not only within the European Union, but worldwide. But more importantly, aid policies should help to make countries less dependent on aid.

KLAUS TSCHUTSCHER, Prime Minister of Liechtenstein, welcomed agreement on the outcome document as an important reaffirmation of the international consensus in the field of development. Unfortunately, however, some crucial priority challenges had not received the requisite attention in the text. Violence and armed conflict, for example, threatened human security and the rule of law, and must be prevented and ended as the core part of every sustainable development effort. That required, in particular, determined action to eradicate impunity for those who used violence against civilians as a tactic of war.

He said that, because development achievements remained fragile if not supported by serious efforts to strengthen good governance, the rule of law, human rights, gender equality, and an active civil society, Liechtenstein offered support by prioritizing education projects in its bilateral development assistance, with a particular emphasis on projects empowering women. His Government was also keenly aware of the illicit capital outflows from developing countries, and supported initiatives that fought corruption and money-laundering.

Liechtenstein's ODA represented 0.6 per cent of the country's GNI, and the Government recognized the development goal of 0.7 per cent ODA/GNI, he said. Liechtenstein was particularly committed to addressing new development challenges in connection with climate change, having already set aside the first round of new and additional funds to help developing countries address that challenge.

SHEIKH HASINA, Prime Minister of Bangladesh, said that the Millennium Development Goals had been adopted by an unprecedented consensus and had given a benchmark to measure performance of national Governments, private sectors, civil society, development partners and intergovernmental bodies. Her country's planning and budgeting process since 2001 had sought to achieve the Millennium Goals as part of the national development plans. Bangladesh had devised a five-year plan to achieve the targets as a step towards making itself a middle-income country by 2021, the Golden Jubilee Year of its independence. Despite the global recession, decline in world trade and the impact of climate change, her country had been able to achieve satisfactory progress, including in poverty alleviation, primary education, gender equality and reducing child mortality.

She said that achievement of other Goals were facing difficulties for lack of resources, including maternal mortality, income inequality, enrolment in primary education, improving immunization and improved access to safe drinking water and sanitation. A formidable challenge was the natural disasters, due to global warming, which were pushing "climate migrants" into the overburdened cities. A 1-metre rise in sea level would submerge a quarter of Bangladesh's land mass, displacing 30 million people, and 1 in 7 persons would be a "climate migrant". She urged the global community to be sensitive to that emerging challenge and to find innovative ways to prevent it and rehabilitate its victims.

The Millennium Development Goals were achievable when nationally owned development strategies, policies and programmes were supported by international development partners, she said. The developed world should demonstrate its sincerity by helping to reduce the implementation gap. Clearly, the answer was fulfilling the ODA commitment of 0.7 per cent of GDP. Some $22.1 billion was required to attain all the Millennium Goals in Bangladesh. The global recession, the food and fuel crisis, and the challenges of climate change and natural disasters had complicated the road to 2015. "But they do not make the MDGs unattainable if we collectively determine and partner to achieve them. Let us rise and resolve in that spirit as one community in a globalized world to achieve all our internationally agreed development goals, including the MDGs, thereby serving ourselves, our progeny and posterity."

MIZENGO PINDA, Prime Minister of the United Republic of Tanzania, said much remained to be done to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, but the world could not afford to be discouraged. Today was an opportunity to reaffirm the commitment to ensure that all Goals were met everywhere by 2015. He lauded the United Nations strategy on women's and children's health and the Secretary-General's leadership in developing it. Bilateral and regional partnerships were at the core of successes achieved and they would determine future successes. The United Republic of Tanzania had reaffirmed its commitment to achieve the Millennium Goals by enacting economic and governance reforms, which had spurred growth averaging 7 per cent during the last decade. But that was not enough to achieve the Goals.

He said that the number of people living on less than $1 per day had dropped from 38.6 per cent in 1991 to 33.6 per cent in 2007 for mainland Tanzania and from 61 per cent in 1990 to 49 per cent in 2004 for Zanzibar. More than 80 per cent of the population lived in rural areas and was dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. Investments in agriculture were essential to emancipate most Tanzanians from poverty. The Government's "Agriculture First" initiative aimed to accelerate the green revolution by, among other things, training agriculture extension officers, investing in irrigation infrastructure and using modern technology and improved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides. It aimed to address the critical problem of agricultural financing. He appealed to the international community to support those efforts.

Given timely and predictable support, the United Republic of Tanzania would achieve the first millennium target, he said. HIV prevalence had dropped from 7 per cent in 2003 to 5.7 per cent in 2008 in mainland Tanzania. The Zanzibar rate had remained at 0.6 per cent. In Zanzibar, malaria rates had dropped from 49.2 per cent in 2000 to 0.8 per cent in 2009 due to key cost-effective prevention. But there was little progress in child mortality. The country had done well in primary education, thanks to good policies, budgetary increases and comprehensive education programmes. It was also on track to meet the target of full school enrolment by 2015, and it was committed to doing everything possible to implement the remaining Millennium Development Goals by 2015. But to succeed, it counted on renewed and expanded commitment from its development partners.

GILBERT FOSSOUN HOUNGBO, Prime Minister of Togo, opened by saying that the Millennium Development Goals were valid for all those involved in development, and he noted that all efforts should be on achieving results. With respect to Togo, since 2006 it had been calm politically, and thus, it was time to re-launch the process of a long-term development strategy, which was a foundation for crafting the poverty reduction strategy paper.

He said his country had taken measures to improve many things, including governance, rule of law, management of public finance and mobilization of domestic finances. In addition, Togo facilitated access for farmers to fertilizers and seeds, and had better organized agricultural producers. Those measures explained the surplus production and economic growth, albeit modest. In fact, he was certain the growing contribution of small farmers beyond the level of food security would be a key lever of economic growth, as it was at least 7 per cent.

The acceleration of achieving the Millennium Goals, however, entailed $225 million in financing, which would help wealth creation and poverty reduction in rural areas. He noted improvements in education, and said that free primary education had enabled enrolment increases from 74 per cent 2006 to 87 per cent in 2008. However, one could not focus only on primary education, as it was also necessary to invest in secondary and superior education, especially research. In terms of health, HIV prevalence had been halved, and care for affected persons had improved. In terms of infant health care, he noted that vaccinations and mosquito nets had reduced infant mortality rates.

GERVAIS RUFYIKIRI, Second Vice-President of Burundi, said it was possible for Burundi to achieve some of the Millennium Goal targets. Burundi was in a post-conflict situation and had gone through serious socio-political crises which had had a negative impact on development. The decades-old civil war had ended in 2005 and the Government had since tried to make up for lost time in achieving the Goals. Some area had seen great improvement. Burundi was set to achieve Goal 2 on the provision of free primary education, as some 90 per cent of the country's children were now enrolled in primary school. Progress had been also been made regarding gender equality in primary and secondary education.

As for representation of women in decision-making, he said they accounted for 32 per cent in the National Assembly and for 44 per cent in the Senate. Further, the goal regarding the prevalence of malaria and tuberculosis could be achieved be by 2015. Goal 7, on safe access to drinking water, could probably also be achieved. As for Goal 1, on poverty eradication, programmes had been made in strengthening dialogue with Burundi's partners. He said that national development strategies had been approved, and last year, Burundi had achieved the requirements for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative.

There were problems, however, with achieving the targets for poverty alleviation, hunger reduction, safe housing, preservation of biodiversity and reduction in the spread of HIV/AIDS. He said efforts to achieve those targets should be given sufficient resources by the international community. Among strategies planned was the commitment of the Government to provide strategies for growth and poverty reduction.

GEORGES REBELO CHIKOTI, Secretary of State for External Relations of Angola, declared: "The fight against poverty cannot be won only with the holding of conferences and summits to negotiate more commitments to development." Overcoming hunger and poverty required primarily implementing commitments already made. The international community must ensure that those promises were translated into concrete actions. Eradicating extreme poverty, the big challenge of the day, required Governments, civil society and the private sector join forces as part of a more effective partnership for development. It was also important to include the Millennium Development Goals in national strategies for poverty reduction and national development plans.

He said that some international mechanisms already agreed upon that had been applied inconsistently or simply ignored included increasing ODA; reform of the international financial architecture; deregulating international trade; increasing investments in agriculture in Africa; creation of an integrated microcredit programme; and the global partnership for development. All countries, collectively and individually, should feel obliged to fight tenaciously to achieve the Millennium Goals, especially in African countries where the situation was particularly difficult. "We are convinced that Africa has potential and, once supported by the international community, it will be able to overcome challenges in order to enable the economic growth and sustainable development of the continent."

Shortly after the end of the war in 2002, Angola had started a broad national reconstruction and poverty reduction programme, he said. His country had seen improvement in all basic indicators of the Goals. More than 2 million children had been enrolled in primary education since 2002. He hoped that infection rates of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis could drastically reduce the causes of death in women and children by 2015. In order to eradicate hunger and poverty, Angola had adopted the National Strategy for Food Security, a mechanism that would increase agricultural production in a sustainable manner. Fighting hunger and poverty would allow for ensuring respect for human rights while providing adequate living conditions for all citizens.

GEORGE PAPANDREOU, Prime Minister of Greece, said that his country had launched radical reforms to make the Government more transparent, its institutions more efficient and its economy more competitive. The Government was delivering those changes with the citizens, not in spite of them. They could, however, not do that alone; in an interdependent world, they all needed to work together. That also meant working more closely with social partners, non-governmental organizations and the private sector in order to deliver change.

Around the world, he said, many citizens felt disempowered. They knew that the resources existed to make poverty history, to wipe out illiteracy, to prevent pandemics, and to protect women and children, but resources and capabilities were not being managed to do so. That was why citizens questioned the political will of the international community to move forward as a global community. They expected political leaders to do more to correct the imbalances that the current global governance had created. Indeed, underlying the failure to act on the good intentions of the world leaders was a crisis of governance. National institutions lacked the capability to deal with global issues. The concentration of power, capital and media enabled the privileged with vested interests to "capture" the democratic processes.

He urged leaders to step up to the challenge to reform democratic institutions with greater urgency and resolve. They should prove that democracies could empower citizens, and equalize opportunities so that the benefits of globalization could be fairly and evenly distributed. New tools were needed to optimize the use of resources and change financial incentives. A financial transaction tax, carbon tax or green bonds could be used to fund education, health care, green infrastructure and technology in developing countries. Instead of national austerity, the international community should be thinking in terms of global responsibility. Unless forces were joined to face the challenges ahead, the world would remain vulnerable to new crises.

REEM IBRAHIM AL HASHIMI, Minister of State of the United Arab Emirates, opened by stating a firm commitment to the Millennium Declaration, and said that such commitment was a main factor in the maintenance of peace and security in the world and the way to the realization of prosperity and stability to the people of all countries. The economic, financial and security conditions during the last few years demonstrated how interlinked the interests of countries of the world were. No country was safe from the impact of the economic crises. The United Arab Emirates strongly believed that success in achieving the Millennium Goals required an effective global partnership within the framework of the recommendations of the Millennium Declaration and other development-focused conferences.

He recognized that the global economic crisis had led to the recession in developed donor countries, but urged those countries not to withdraw their commitments and keep working towards achieving the 0.7 per cent of GDP as ODA for the developing countries. He emphasized the importance of reforming the international economic, financial and trade systems, which would allow developing countries the ability to participate in the international market equitably.

The United Arab Emirates had succeeded in containing the aftermath of the economic crisis so as not to impact achievements in the development process and fall back on commitments to foreign aid. He said his country exploited oil revenue to expand and diversify sources of national income and focus on human development, and to achieve total eradication of poverty, raise income per capita to the highest levels in the world and achieve gender equality. His country believed in the high value of human life and in the importance of protecting and developing it and providing a dignified source of living for human beings, wherever they are. The United Arab Emirates had thus adopted a foreign policy focused on cooperation and bilateral and international partnerships to achieve development in other countries. The United Arab Emirates Partnership in the Pacific programme had been launched in February 2010 with the initial capital of $50 million, solely dedicated to funding initiatives focused on Pacific island nations.

ELMAR MAMMADYAROV, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, reiterated his country's strong commitment to effectively implement the Millennium Goals by 2015. Despite continued military occupation of nearly 20 per cent of Azerbaijan's territory by Armenia, and the presence of about 1 million refugees and forcibly displaced persons, his country had experienced unprecedented economic growth in the past five years. On average, its economy had grown at a 20 per cent annualized pace. Available financial resources had provided ample opportunities to fund policy measures aimed at poverty reduction and the achievement of other Millennium Goals. The Government's primary goal was to spend available funds in the most efficient and transparent manner.

With regard to poverty reduction, he said Azerbaijan had demonstrated political will, launching a new state programme for poverty reduction and sustainable development for the period 2008 to 2015. Through the programme, his Government aimed to ensure sustainable economic development, significantly decrease poverty rates and protect vulnerable groups, among other things. Actions taken by his Government to improve the quality of school education included an education reform strategy supported by the World Bank. It was focused on reforming general compulsory education. Consistent measures for women had laid a firm legal and institutional foundation for the achievement of gender equality.

Sustainable progress with regard to reducing child and maternal mortality depended on a reduction in income poverty, as well as further improvements in the access and quality of health services, he said. Additional efforts were required to reduce the maternal mortality rate. Full realization of that goal required "due" financial resources and technical assistance, and donor countries had a responsibility to cooperate with and assist developing and least developed countries in that respect. Azerbaijan, determined to foster global cooperation in all spheres, had successfully launched several infrastructure projects which contributed to the development of neighbouring countries. Its Government had advanced an initiative to jointly build and manage the Trans-Eurasian information superhighway. The scheme should facilitate supplying countries in the region with Internet, telecommunications systems, e-information resources and e-economies.

RICARDO PATINO AROCA, Minister for Foreign Affairs, External Commerce and Integration of Ecuador, said that, three years ago, the President of Ecuador had asked the country to go beyond the Millennium Goals in order to overcome inequalities. Such a policy could lead to a dignified life for all, beyond social well-being. Renewed prominence of collective action must be restored. Access to justice and respect for all rights should be guaranteed. That was also the path to peace.

He said his country was concerned that social issues were not given the central importance needed in the attainment of the Millennium Goals, but that military expenditure had been growing, and had increased by 49 per cent since 2000. That was standing in the way of achieving the Goals. He encouraged the international community to show the political will to reverse that trend. A more human face was needed, otherwise wars would continue, with hundreds of millions people going hungry and threatened by climate change.

Ecuador had improved the quality of life for its people, he said. It had reduced poverty from 61 per cent to 53 per cent in rural areas over the last three years and had doubled its social investments. The country was on track to achieve the Goals. Education had been made universal. Teaching materials were provided in the indigenous languages. Infant mortality had been reduced. Maternal health had been improved through better infrastructures so that populations previously marginalized could be reached. There were also policies in place for the conservation of the environment. Still, not enough had been done. Ecuador wanted to build a society with equity, which would only be possible if the global financial structures were rebuilt in a way that supported social development.

MURRAY MCCULLY, Minister for Foreign Affairs for New Zealand, drew attention to recent reports citing the South Pacific as second only to sub-Saharan Africa in terms of lack of progress in achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals. He noted that many places in the South Pacific must deal with the additional challenges of climate change.

"But more money alone will not solve these problems," he said. A greater focus on aid effectiveness and donor coordination were needed. On the latter point, New Zealand was a strong supporter of the Cairns Compact as a means to improve donor coordination in the region. With regard to aid effectiveness, it would focus on sustainable economic development. The country was undertaking a major programme of investment in renewable energy infrastructure, particularly solar and wind. New Zealand shared the optimism of those who believed progress could be faster and better. "But it will not be because we have established new committees, or new procedures," he stated. The essential challenge was to get more practical by focusing on outcomes, not processes.

OLDEMIRO MARQUES BALOI, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique, highlighted the importance of the gathering, aimed at reviewing the progress and obstacles in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Ten years ago, when Mozambique had joined other nations in adopting the Millennium Declaration, and the country was aware of the challenges it faced to meet the targets. Today, he focused discussion on Goals 4 and 5, on reducing child mortality and improving maternal health, and said that investing in women's and children's health was an unequivocal way of investing in social and economic development, while meeting the remaining Goals.

He said that women's and children's health indicators showed some progress since the Goals' adoption, which were reflected by the reduction of maternal and infant mortality rates. Those indicators showed the path that the country needed to take to meet the objectives for women's and children's health care. The Government's main focus was to ensure that women gave birth without the risk of death. He highlighted some actions of particular importance in improving health care overall, which included recognizing the impact of social factors in community health; increasing access to clean water and basic sanitation; and implementing programmes that promoted girls' school enrolment at the primary school level. Since Mozambique's independence, women and children had had free access to health care, which had led to a great reduction in maternal mortality. There was also a network of community workers, which galvanized communities to adopt domestic practices for the prevention of diseases, among other things.

Although progress had been made, the current international context posed threats, due to climate change, the food and fuel crises, and more recently, the global financial crisis. He hoped the outcome document of the current meeting would reflect the urgent need to reinvigorate engagement to implement the commitments made in Monterrey. Indeed, he expected that the donor community would ensure sufficient financial support to developing countries. Mozambique was firmly committed to strong social and macroeconomic policies, good governance and, in the long-term, less dependence on foreign aid. He recommitted to placing women's and children's health care at the top of the development agenda.

URMAS PAET, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Estonia, recognized the Millennium Development Goals as the most significant promise ever made to reduce poverty and inequality worldwide, and stressed the importance of recognizing past mistakes in order to move forward. While great strides had been made in reaching the Goals by 2015 - notably in the areas of poverty reduction, access to clean water, increased school enrolment, and impressive strides against infectious diseases - he called the global record "mixed". Significant progress was still needed in the areas of gender equality, unemployment, malnutrition and hunger.

Regarding gender equality, he said Estonia had launched bilateral projects in priority countries, for example, in Afghanistan, where it had focused on improving the health of women and girls, and the country would continue to advocate for the incorporation of a gender dimension into all United Nations activities. For this purpose, his Government had already decided to make its first contribution to UN Women. Further, Estonia remained committed to supporting the development of access to technologies, which had been a "crucial engine" of economic progress and modernization for the country over the last two decades. In closing, he reiterated Estonia's commitment to turning the Millennium Development Goals into the "Millennium Development Achievements".

ALEXIS THAMBWE MWAMBA, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said that everyone should decide here and now that there was enough time to implement the Millennium Goals and show their international solidarity. With sufficient financial resources, the Goals could be achieved. Everyone was aware of the internal constraints to achieving the Goals, he said, pointing to obstacles such as the lack of quality data to guide decision-making and the gap between pledges and actual funding.

He said developing countries could achieve all the Goals provided they increased financing from the public sector and encouraged private business involvement. His country was working to create an enabling environment and investment climate for the private sector. It also sought to induce foreign direct investment through tax reform. The country had made progress with regard to the Millennium Goals, especially with primary school education, political empowerment of women, improved immunization for children under age 5, and slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS. More children were sleeping under mosquito nets. Good governance had helped, but his country needed to improve the national statistic system, advance decentralization, accelerate land reform and protect the environment and its species and ecosystems.

However, he lamented, all those efforts would not suffice to achieve the Millennium Goals. ODA must be increased, he urged, recalling the Monterrey Consensus and all other such previous commitments. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was a post-conflict country; in many cases there was no possibility of children to go to school. Women were still systematically raped, and people were forced to abandon their farms and herds. His country requested that it be placed in priority programmes for sustained support. It was necessary to create jobs for youth. He remained convinced that, with international support and good governance, it would be possible to achieve the goals to eradicate hunger and poverty.

HOSHYAR ZEBARI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq, said that, in general, he supported the outcome document to be adopted. Some progress in attainment of the Millennium Development Goals had been made, but more than 1 billion people were still living in extreme poverty, five years away from 2015. Absent greater progress, a fertile ground would be created for instability, terrorism and degradation of the environment. Attainment of the Goals was only possible if there was a political will combined with sufficient resources and international cooperation.

He said the situation in Iraq had improved significantly. Per capita income had increased, as had individual prosperity. The 2010 budget had been designed, not only to support reconstruction, but also to build a healthy and strong economy. The Government had launched a five-year development plan, which included $168 billion to improve the quality of services. That plan would create around 4 million jobs. In order to attain the Goals on health, the Iraqi policy was based on improving agricultural yields by providing subsidies to farmers. That, in turn, would reduce hunger and improve nutrition, and reduce the level of infant mortality. The education sector was being reformed, and there were awareness programmes that addressed girls' early dropout rate from school and other social obstacles to their education. Equality between men and women was now ensured by law. Women made up 25 per cent of the membership of Parliament, the highest proportion in the region. The number of hospitals, pharmacies and health centres for pregnant women and centres for epidemic diseases had been increased.

International cooperation was important for Iraq, he said. It cooperated with the United Nations and its specialized agencies and programmes, especially in the area of reconstruction. The economy was being integrated with that of the region. Economic measures had been adopted and the country had met its commitments with respect to IMF. Iraq had entered into agreements with international debtors regarding debts of the previous regime, and had reduced by 80 per cent its debts to the Paris Club. He hoped other creditor States would also reduce the bilateral debt. Development remained a national priority, which must be addressed by the leadership at the national and regional levels. He hoped that Iraq's plan would lead to a quality change in the country, which would in turn contribute to stability in the region.

ALVIN BERNARD, Minister of State of Dominica, said that the first five years of implementing the Millennium Goals had seen steady progress, but further progress had been stymied by the food crisis, the energy crisis and the global economic and financial crisis. With only five years left, efforts must be intensified. A good starting point in that regard was the fulfilment of the commitments made in the 2002 Monterrey Consensus. That should also include the reconfiguration of the international financial institutions to take into account the special needs of developing countries. Those efforts must complement the conclusion of the Doha development agenda. The recognition of the special and differential status of developing countries, especially small island developing States, was critical to their survival in what had become "a hostile global trading environment". Another area requiring urgent attention was the contribution of ODA and technology transfer.

He said that despite many challenges, Dominica had been able to make major achievements in pursuit of the Millennium Goals through sound fiscal policy, strong political leaderships and hard work. Developed countries, especially European Union countries, had been reliable partners. There had also been unprecedented South-South cooperation with China, Cuba, Venezuela and Libya in the areas of social and physical infrastructure development. Household poverty had dropped from 39 per cent in 2002 to 28.8 per cent in 2009. Per capita income had risen from $11,430 in 2005 to $14,184 in 2009. Universal secondary education had been achieved in 2005. The Caribbean region had been heavily affected by HIV/AIDS. Efforts by the regional Governments had been commendable. Education and public awareness programmes had brought the issue to the fore.

Dominica had been dubbed the "nature island" of the Caribbean, due to the prudent environmental policies supported by legislation and established practices and traditions, he said. However, the effects of climate change had made the country more vulnerable to natural disasters. Over the past 10 years, the country had been vigorously pursuing the development of geothermal energy. The first phase of that project had been completed. He looked forward to the commercialization phase, when electricity could be generated for the domestic markets as well as for neighbouring markets. The achievement of the Millennium Goals required global action, premised on strong global partnerships, with a central role for the United Nations. Work on reform of the Organization, therefore, must be continued. Small island developing States must be recognized as a special entity within the United Nations system.

ABUBAKR A. AL-QIRBI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Yemen, opened by saying that 10 years ago, the world had gathered to establish a global partnership for development and had produced worthy commitments. With less than five years to go, today's high-level meeting was a way to highlight initiatives to serve as guidelines in countries and regions, and to reflect on shortcomings. One of the main aims was to scale up global partnerships and address the remaining gaps. It was incumbent upon all not to fall short because of a lack of resources. Countries that were lagging behind, including in Africa, must be assisted. The "Group of 77" developing countries and China believed that a strong partnership should be a major cornerstone to achieve the Millennium Goals.

Like previous speakers, he noted that volatile energy prices, the financial crisis, food security and climate change could undermine achievement of the Millennium Goals. The ongoing financial crisis reversed many development gains. Two years later, developing countries had not recovered. All of them had made progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals, albeit, uneven. Despite positive developments, however, there were still 1 billion people living in extreme poverty, and insufficient advances towards women's empowerment. Almost half the people in the developing world still did not have access to basic sanitation, and many were unemployed.

He stressed the need for "coherent" development, and stressed that the Millennium Goals should be the overreaching goal of the development activities of the United Nations. He also emphasized the United Nations role in global financial governance. The current meeting was an important step in accelerating attainment of the Millennium Goals, but more needed to be done. The international community should step up the Global Partnership for Development. The Group of 77 and China stood ready to do its part and foster development to achieve the timely achievement of the Goals.

PETER K.A. TURKSON, President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace of the Holy See, noted that the unanimous endorsement of the Millennium Declaration had underscored the human aspects of development and that progress had been made in that regard, but much remained to be done to guarantee the availability of resources. He emphasized his support for "the full and integral compliance" of the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development, as well as the need to eradicate the debts of poor countries and reinforce the allocation of 0.7 per cent GDP for ODA.

The campaign for development, he stated, had revealed that "success is not attributable so much to economic assistance as to creativity and resourcefulness". In that context, population policies that violated human dignity did not serve the Millennium Goals. Rather, ensure to poor countries the effective mainframe of Goal 8, and they would assume the shared responsibility and national ownership of achieving the other Goals. "The Millennium Development Goals should be used to fight poverty and not to eliminate the poor," he said.

The Holy See invited countries to provide quality resources for the health-care needs of mothers and their babies, including the unborn, he said. Repeated references in the outcome document to "sexual and reproductive health" and "family planning" raised deep concerns, as those could be interpreted as including access to abortion and methods of family planning that were not in accordance with the natural law.

TOMAS DUB, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, welcomed the political will to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, but said the major task of the next five years was to create mechanisms that would translate the commitments into reality at a local level. On a national level, it was also necessary to regularly update development strategies and plans that reflected the current statistics and lessons learned, and to integrate them into national legislative systems. Innovative approaches leading to the achievement of the Goals, at both a national and local level, must be designed from the bottom up, on the basis of country-specific facts and a holistic community-led approach.

Further, eradicating poverty should not be limited to ODA - or to measures to curb inflation and public debt, he said. Instead, it required a combination of measures that encouraged employment, fiscal and monetary stabilization, mobilization of domestic resources and good governance. Those measures were among the top priorities in the Czech Republic's new Strategy of Development Cooperation and Strategy of Transition Policy, which had contributed to promoting transition in Eastern Europe and Western Balkans. Social development was a fundamental prerequisite for achieving all the Millennium Goals. Good governance and respect of human rights were among the main priorities of the Czech Republic. Good governance and rule of law at all levels, as well as solid democratic institutions, were essential, not only for attainment of the Goals, but also for sustained, inclusive and equitable development in general.

SAYYID BADR BIN HAMAD AL BUSAIDI, State Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Oman, said the Millennium Summit was a milestone in international cooperation, and if the eight Goals outlined by that meeting were implemented, the global community would create a world with greater access to health care and education. Ten years on, there had been success in some areas. Progress continued in poverty reduction, putting more children in schools, controlling malaria and HIV, and providing safe water. However, many targets were likely to be missed. At a time of economic crisis, combating global poverty, disease and inequality was not easy. The negative impact of natural disasters, epidemics and civil unrest served to make debt-ridden developing countries poorer. The Goals made up the most broadly supported, comprehensive and specific anti-poverty strategy the world had ever agreed on.

The initiative would not end in 2015. Across the world, progress towards the Goals was uneven. Politicized aid-giving factionalized the global community. He urged that development should reach everyone, everywhere. Oman continued to achieve positive progress in all the areas of the Goals. For example, under-five mortality rates had fallen by 29 per cent since 1990. In addition, the Government's promotion of women to numerous leadership positions provided a meritocratic example following the basic principle of equality. However, he put two challenges forward: to work on reducing road traffic accidents and non-communicable diseases. Attaining the Goals was a realistic aim for the future, but to succeed, one had to reflect on the old saying: "a stranger is a friend I have not yet met". Let us help our friends, strangers and each other, he said.

MAX HENDERSON HERNANDEZ, Vice-Minister of Planning of Mexico, said the meeting was of highest relevance because it allowed an assessment of the advances achieved, the challenges that remained, and especially because it allowed for a reiteration of prior commitments. For Mexico, achievement of the Goals constituted a commitment of the State. That was why, both nationally and internationally, Mexico had taken decisive actions to reach them. For Mexico, it was an honour to reiterate that the Goals were a component of its social policy. Advances in social development were the result of a solid institutional framework that allowed the Government to carry out a national social policy, sustained by, among others, instruments of planning, accountability and evaluation, as well as laws, inter-institutional coordination and registers of beneficiaries of social programmes.

Mexico relied on a strategy of "vivir mejor" - or "living better" - to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, which included the development of basic skills; supporting sustained actions on food, health, education and housing; the consolidation of a social protection network; and the establishment of bridges that connected social and economic policies. Mexico registered an advance; that the country had achieved in advance the Goal set for 2015 of reducing by half the percentage of people with incomes lower than $1 a day. In addition, he registered significant advances related to primary education for children.

He went on to highlight the "Guanajuato Declaration" which had come out of the World Youth Conference. It underlined the importance of the Millennium Goals for that demographic. He hoped that the Declaration would be useful and that new initiatives would allow youth to be introduced productively into the economies. Health care was a major Goal, and the efforts to pay close attention to such matters would also take advantage of synergies with other social programmes. He also noted the adverse effects of climate change, and said that 2010 would be key in committing to face that global challenge.

CAROLINE ZIADE (Lebanon) said today's meeting must be used as an opportunity to reaffirm commitments, implement objectives and strengthen partnerships. Lebanon, like other countries, continued to suffer from the negative impacts of climate change, as well as from the financial crisis and other "faces of globalization" that had created a bigger gap between rich and poor. In cooperation with UNDP, Lebanon had published a report indicating that the country was on the right track to achieving the Goals by 2015. Citing examples, she said Lebanon had reduced the poverty rate from 28 per cent in 1999 to 8 per cent in 2004.

Moreover, gender equality, as related to education level, had increased, she said, while the number of female parliamentarians in the last elections was no less than six. The country also had reduced child mortality from 2000 levels and decreased infant deaths from 1990 levels. At the same time, Israel's 2006 war with Lebanon had had devastating effects on economic and social development. Debt was high and the Government was trying to reduce the servicing of public debt. Associated costs had been reduced from 18 per cent of GDP in 2001 to 12 per cent in 2008. Urging the achievement of the Goals, she said the dreams of the world's poor must not disappear like mirages.

JOSE MANUEL DURAO BARROSO, President of the European Commission, speaking on behalf of the European Union, called extreme poverty the most challenging global issue, which "mocks" our technical progress, and urged the international community to confront social and gender equalities that locked too many people into poverty. The European Union, as the world's leading donor - accounting for more than 50 per cent of the development aid - had kept the fight against poverty high on its agenda, he said.

Among its achievements, the European Union had helped put 9 million more girls and boys in schools since 2001, connected 31 million households to clean drinking water, and provided EUR1.5 billion in additional support through food programmes that benefited 50 million people, he said. Despite such gains, efforts must be increased in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. In June, Europe's leaders had agreed on an ambitious plan for those Goals where the least progress had been made, and in those regions and countries that were most lagging behind, including those experiencing conflict, crisis and fragile governance. The plan confirmed the Union's commitment to meet the 0.7 per cent of GNI target by 2015, and he called on other donors to step up their own level of ambition.

Reaffirming Europe's commitment to meet the challenge, he announced that the Union was ready to offer to the most committed and needy countries an "MDG initiative amounting to EUR1 billion to make progress on those Goals we are furthest from achieving". He urged results, warning "time is running out". At the same time, he said aid was a catalyst and not a cure. That was why it was also important that the recipients took charge of their own development. That meant mobilizing domestic policies and resources to support the Goals. "Just as donors should be held accountable, partner countries should also be held accountable for the results they achieve," he concluded. "We owe this to all our fellow human beings fighting to survive on a dollar a day," he added.

EKMELEDDIN IHSANOGLU, Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, said poverty remained one of the biggest challenges to the socio-economic development of developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Notwithstanding the abundant natural and material endowments in some Conference countries, about 22 of its 57 member States were categorized as least developed countries, while about 41 others were considered as low-income food-deficit countries. In some member States, 70 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line. The Islamic Conference had therefore reinvigorated its machinery for economic cooperation among its members through a comprehensive mobilisation of resources within and outside its community.

He said the major thrust of the Organization of the Islamic Conference's contributions to the achievement of the Goals was the development of the human productive capacity through its poverty-alleviation programmes, expansion of intra-Conference trade, vocational training and agro-industrial capacity-building. The Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development and the Special Programme for Development of Africa had galvanized action in the area of micro-finance, agro-industrial capacity building and rural development. The Solidarity Fund was a $10 billion financing window for targeted interventions to foster sustainable economic growth, reduce illiteracy and eradicate contagious diseases. The Special Programme was a $12 billion facility that focused on agriculture, water and sanitation, power generation, transport infrastructure, education and the elimination of major communicable diseases.

The global food, energy and financial crises had considerably reversed the successes realized during the first five years, he said. The various trade liberalization measures of the Conference's Trade Preferential System had witnessed a steady improvement in the volume of intra-Conference trade, for instance, but that volume had begun to slow down in 2009 as a direct consequence of the global crises. Although the Organization of the Islamic Conference was mobilizing support for actions aimed at mitigating the impacts of the crises, there was a need for global partnerships to address such issues as the reform of the international financial architecture. A wider consultation within the G-20 was necessary to reflect the varied financial systems in the world.

ANDERS JOHNSSON, Secretary-General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, said the recent Third World Conference of Speakers of Parliament had issued a call for securing global democratic accountability for the common good. That summit's outcome document called for greater parliamentary involvement in international cooperation and proposed related action by parliaments and IPU in pursuit of that. The summit had taken stock of progress in developing a parliamentary dimension to international cooperation and to assess parliamentary involvement in support of the Millennium Development Goals. The Goals would not be met without an accompanying sense of accountability. The Speakers had pledged to support efforts in parliament to ensure development goals were taken into account in their daily work and translated into national programmes and laws. They encouraged all parliaments, when examining draft budgets and bills, to assess their impact on meeting the Millennium Development Goals.

Female Speakers who had met in Bern before that summit had called for stronger efforts to meet the fourth and fifth Millennium Development Goals and invited all parliaments to implement the Bern initiative for global parliamentary action on maternal and child health, he said. Much parliamentary work had been done to make the goals achievable, but there had been less progress in parliamentary oversight and review of progress. Broad political support and national ownership were needed to reach the goals. There was no one-size-fits-all policy to achieve the Millennium Goals. Such policies must be tailored to the realities of each country.

SIMA BAHOUS, Assistant Secretary-General for Social Affairs of the League of Arab States, noting the importance of achieving the Goals, said mechanisms of joint Arab action - specialized Arab organizations among them - had laid out programmes to reach the Goals. The 2008 Arab Summit in Riyadh had called for programmes focusing on social and economic development issues aimed at improving the lives of Arab citizens. An assessment of the Arab region had been carried out regarding the achievement of the Goals, while the first economic and social development summit, in 2009, had reaffirmed the region's commitment to them through a programme of action that featured a vision for reducing poverty. Programmes also focused on less developed Arab States were being implemented regionally.

Continuing, she said the Second Arab Development Summit would be held in Egypt in 2011 to evaluate achievements and difficulties. To prepare for today's meeting, the General Secretary, through the Council of Ministers of Social Affairs in the Arab World, among others, had prepared the third Arab report on the Goals for 2010. That report represented the region's position on achieving the Goals, and emphasizing the interdependence among them. It also reaffirmed the need for intensified efforts among regional States, as well as for "inventive" employment opportunities. While it showed that poverty had fallen in most Arab States, it underscored that unemployment was a major challenge, especially among youth. Education, women's empowerment and maternal health also required attention, a fact that must be promoted as each issue had crucial importance in combating poverty.

HD 	Copenhagen Accord Makes Sham of Global Environmental Justice [opinion]

Jan 14, 2010 (The South African Civil Society Information Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- After the 1999 WTO meeting in Seattle, the Copenhagen Climate Summit will probably go down as the next biggest multilateral meeting failure of the 21st century, but I wouldn't say for the right reasons.

In biting cold Copenhagen, there was little recognition that 400 years of capitalism is the underlying cause of global warming and simply not enough understanding that the market-driven solutions espoused by the Kyoto Protocol will only exacerbate the climate crisis and global inequality.

TD 
	

The controversial Copenhagen Accord, secretly drafted by countries of the Global North with the approval of a few handpicked emerging economies, including South Africa, is green washed capitalism with thinly veiled energy security at its heart.

South Africa will join India, China and Brazil in New Delhi at a ministerial level meeting on 24 January 2010 to discuss issues before signing the Accord. In this new round of deal making, they comprise an exclusive group openly courted by the Global North because of their strategic importance in the new geopolitics of the world.

The way forward is a complete travesty for global environmental justice.

The emerging post-Kyoto Accord is not focused on real solutions to restore hundreds of years of natural resource destruction nor is it about the creation of socially and ecologically sound production and consumption systems.

System change is not on the agenda.

Instead, there is an obsession with carbon. The entire focus seems to be on financing an energy agreement and mechanism to create a transition through carbon markets. And what is emerging is that the Global North wants to spearhead and profit from the carbon transition through the control of technology and finance for the Global South.

Essentially, what is being crafted is a win-win situation for big companies that will be allowed to continue polluting through the purchase of carbon credits. Those that invest in becoming more energy efficient will simply pass the cost on to the consumer and receive incentives from their governments.

For example, the Accord supports the privatisation of communal forests by promoting the contentious 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries' (REDD) programme, a collaborative initiative of the United Nations (UN). In short, it rewards developing country governments for reducing deforestation, but in a manner that is beneficial to industry. For example, industries can purchase pockets of forests through long term contracts (essentially they are buying carbon sinks) to receive carbon credits.

This is hugely problematic. Apart from the fact that forests have become another commodity for polluting industries to avoid actual reduction, purchasing forests will also have an impact on the livelihoods of communities dependent on forest resources.

At the same time, imported goods from developing countries, produced with high carbon energy, will be penalised at the borders of developed countries investing in their carbon markets.

These climate protection measures are evident in the United States' (US) Climate Bill. One aspect of the Bill is the US International Reserve Allowance Program. This program intends to address competitiveness that affects US manufacturers. This will be implemented via a border adjustment tax for products from other countries, especially developing countries. So, for a country like South Africa where energy consumption is largely based on coal, exports will be negatively affected, as goods produced here will be regarded as having a competitive advantage on the basis of "cheaper" and dirtier energy generation.

Moreover, writing in the South Centre Bulletin, Vincente Paolo Yu argues that through the Bill, the US is also establishing an Emissions Allowance Rebate Programme that gives a rebate to energy-intensive industries, such as iron or steel factories, which meet certain energy reduction thresholds. Yu explains, "In short, the US government would compensate, i.e. subsidise, the cost incurred by these industries for complying with stringent US green house gas (GHG) emission targets," in particular energy-intensive companies that are deemed to be "trade-vulnerable."

The US, renowned for its unilateral approaches, was at the forefront of spearheading the Accord and promoting an arrangement through which Parties that associate with it will have access to funds. According to Martin Khor, writing in the Malaysian Star, "The US wanted an arrangement through which Parties can associate with the Accord. It said there are funds in the Accord, and 'it is open to any Party that is interested'. This implies that Parties that do not register their endorsement of the Accord would not be eligible for funding."

This development completely undermines the UN's Special Climate Change Fund, which needs replenishing.

North-South hegemony and polarisation didn't only play itself out amongst governments, but was evident, too, in the parallel NGO/civil society event, "Klimaforum" (The People's Climate Summit 09), which I attended.

The legitimacy of and role played by civil society organisations from the North was hugely debatable. Their behaviour towards their Southern counterparts can best be described as paternalistic. When the usual UN-following NGOs and other mainstream environmental organisations were not in the Bella Centre, they dominated the podiums and spaces at the people's summit, many speaking on behalf of the global South, defending indigenous rights, raising the issue of climate impact -- and bringing token people from the South to explain how they are affected.

There was a predominance of "awareness-raising" through song, dance and little skits to what I thought was already a very informed audience. Much of what was presented was a rehashing of the implications of environmental degradation/destruction on poor farmers and indigenous people that was probably spoken about in the Rio Earth Summit nearly two decades ago and the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002. Perhaps the only difference this time is that the condition of poor and marginalized people is getting worse.

Past and current socio-economic challenges faced by many people around the world were simply lumped with climate change.

Similar to those NGOs focusing on how trade liberalisation can benefit the poor, leading NGOs in Copenhagen presented the corporate agenda in a manner that it would benefit the poor and the environment. It was a total paradox.

NGOs seemed trapped in the "mitigation and adaptation" strategy speak, where the rich have to mitigate and the poor need to adapt -- as if climate change is not going to affect the countries of the North.

What was even more patronising was ignoring the right of the people of the Global South to develop and increase their consumption, clearly not on a capitalist accumulative basis, but through self-sustaining and self-reliant approaches where social production is in the hands of workers, where people have access to decent work, where food production is on the basis of agro-ecological production, and where people's access to and ownership of productive resources and social needs are fulfilled.

What was needed and ignored at Copenhagen was a discussion about serious alternatives to what is presently the norm.

Eco-socialist John Bellamy, argues, "...the long-term strategy for ecological revolution throughout the globe involves the building of a society of substantive equality..."

Unfortunately, the Copenhagen Climate Summit did not provide the impetus for this even amongst civil society organisations. Many social justice activists deem it a failure.

Perhaps the "Peoples' World Conference on Climate Change and Mother Earth's Rights," which identifies capitalism as the systemic cause of the climate crisis, will provide a better platform for a more inclusive and equitable response.

The conference to be hosted by Bolivia from the 20th to the 22nd of April 2010, promises "to analyse structural and systemic causes that drive climate change and propose radical measures..."

For social justice movements around the world - A luta continua!

Nov 20, 2009 (Public Agenda/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- A collaborative effort to launch a project to revitalize the family planning and reproductive health global agenda was announced on Wednesday in Kampala by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with support from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The goal of the three-year project is to empower developing countries to advocate for universal access to reproductive health as a critical component in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in health through increased funding, an improved policy environment, and increased visibility for family planning at the local, national, and global levels.

TD 
	

Supported by both the Bill & Melinda Gates and the David and Lucile Packard Foundations with combined grants totaling $12 million, the project will reach governments, international donors, and multilateral agencies about the urgent need to invest in family planning to reach the 200 million women who wish to delay or end childbearing, but do not have access to family planning services and supplies.

"The Bloomberg School of Public Health is proud to be a part of this collaborative effort as we continue on our long-term path and commitment to improving the health and well-being of women throughout the developing world," said Michael J. Klag, MD, MPH, Dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

As stated by William H. Gates, Sr., Co-Chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, in his welcome remarks at the International Conference on Family Planning: Research and Best Practices conference in Kampala on November 15th, "Bill, Melinda, and I believe that universal access to family planning and reproductive health is essential to a better future. Men and women should be able to freely choose the number and timing of their children."

The project will build on past investments in family planning and ongoing activities in reproductive health advocacy, leadership development, knowledge generation, and innovative service delivery projects. The project's momentum will be fueled by the re-emergence of the United States and the continuing and growing interest of European donors in the issue of family planning.

"The success of this initiative will depend on strong leadership from local champions and political support for family planning,? noted Musimbi Kanyoro, director of the Population and Reproductive Health Program at the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. "We believe the initiative's focus on the global South could prove to be empowering for local communities in the South and also serve to transform the global conversation about family planning."

A unique aspect of the new evidence-based project is its emphasis on harnessing the voices of women and men in the global South to demand access to family planning and reproductive health services. The project will increase the volume of these voices from the South so they are heard at the local, national, regional, and global levels. It will also create platforms for advocates in the global South to network and organize, enabling organizations to more effectively collaborate and share best practices and lessons learned.

"The project is designed to create a sense of ownership about the importance of family planning among developing countries, especially in countries with the highest maternal and neonatal death rates as well as unmet need," said Jotham Musinguzi, the Director of the Kampala office in the Partners for Population and Development (PPD).

The project will be implemented in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia by a consortium of core partners, including the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Partners in Population and Development (PPD), an inter-governmental agency of 26 countries representing the voices for population and family planning from the South; the African Women's Development Fund based in Ghana; and the Future's Group International. The consortium will collaborate closely with USAID, other bilateral donors, international and local non-governmental organizations, and the private sector in advocating for increased political commitment and resources. Additionally, the project will work closely with USAID?s Repositioning Family Planning Initiative to draw on lessons learned and to potentially replicate and scale up successful initiatives.

"President Obama has demonstrated his support for family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) by proposing the largest budget for FP/RH in USAID's history. He has also established family planning as a priority under the new Global Health Initiative which seeks to build strong partnerships at the country and international levels, said Dr. Scott Radloff, Director of the Office of Population and Reproductive Health. "This consortium is an excellent example of just such a partnership."

The project will also help establish a sustainable African Women for Reproductive Health Network to harness the energy, talents, and needs of women at the community level. In past decades, women have become change agents at the national and global levels.

"The women in the Network, like this consortium, understand that if we do not address the unmet need for family planning, the other global health goals of improving maternal, infant, and child deaths and combating infectious disease will be difficult to achieve by 2015," concluded Professor Duff Gillespie at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

New York, Jun 17, 2008 (The Rockefeller Foundation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Accelerating innovative applications of emerging digital technologies to improve the health of poor and vulnerable people around the world--a field known as eHealth--will be the main topic of a major international conference hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation. The conference, Making the eHealth Connection: Global Partnerships, Local Solutions, will take place from July 13 to August 8, 2008.

TD 
	

Working with twelve leading organizations from the fields of global health, international development, and information and communications technology (ICT), the Rockefeller Foundation and its partners will bring together luminaries from industry, government, and civil society as well as donors and researchers at its Bellagio Center in Italy. The action-oriented agenda will focus on how deploying eHealth and ICT in health systems can improve the access, efficiency and quality of health services. Importantly, the conference focus is on the Global South-developing countries-where health infrastructure and capacity challenges loom large and eHealth technology, a lynchpin in modern health care systems, is at a tipping point. The conference will set the stage for long-term sustainable collaboration in the eHealth field.

"The emerging field of eHealth seeks to harness the power of ICT to strengthen health systems and help billions of people access affordable health care," said Judith Rodin, President of the Rockefeller Foundation. "We believe that Making the eHealth Connection, this summer's conference at the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center, can dramatically advance efforts to meet this critical challenge by building the necessary coalitions and resources."

Participants at the month-long Making the eHealth Connection conference will engage in intense high-level discussions that aim to advance learning on new solutions, needed breakthroughs and scaling current barriers. Critical eHealth issues will be discussed in eight targeted conference sessions:

The Path to Interoperability,Public Health Informatics and National Health Information systems,Access to Information and Knowledge-sharingCapacity building for eHealth,Electronic Health Records,Mobile Health (mHealth) and Mobile Telemedicine,National eHealth Policies, andUnlocking eHealth Markets.

Two parallel sessions will take place each week, from July 13 to August 8, 2008. The overarching goal of the conference is to develop support for workable solutions and to give new impetus for collaboratively funding, designing and deploying eHealth systems in the Global South and around the world.

The Rockefeller Foundation has partnered with a number of leading institutions in order to organize the conference, including the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA), Health Level Seven (HL7), Health Metrics Network (HMN), Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME), Partners in Health (PIH), Regenstrief Institute, Telemedicine Society of India, United Nations Foundation (UNF) and Vodafone Group Foundation Technology Partnership, University of Washington's Center for Public Health Informatics, and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Tim Evans, MD, Assistant Director-General for Information, Evidence and Research at the World Health Organization (WHO), and a Making the eHealth Connection summer conference series organizer, said, "This event is an important landmark. It shows global commitment to eHealth's role in health systems, underscoring the World Health Assembly resolution on eHealth in 2005, and is intended to support WHO's efforts to promote equitable access to essential care worldwide."

Professor Krishnan Ganapathy, Founder Member and Joint Secretary of the Telemedicine Society of India, and one of the conference organizers, said, "The conference's focus on the nexus of eHealth and the Global South is notable. Given the rapid spread of mobile communications technologies, this conference should provide timely information to and learnings from several countries in the Global South, such as India, that have committed resources to developing and deploying eHealth technology, and are interested in learning how mobile technology and telemedicine are converging. Developing countries can now leap frog, not even piggy back. We hope this will illuminate a path for others to follow."

"This effort comes at a critical moment," said Don E. Detmer, MD, MA, President and CEO of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and a conference organizer with the collaboration of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). "As a long-time proponent of eHealth and informatics for improving care for patients and populations, this initiative offers a rare opportunity for us to share perspectives as we seek to integrate a set of complex requirements so that coordinated progress can occur across borders. We must effectively address our shared global health disease, capacity-building, and workforce challenges, most especially in the Global South. AMIA is delighted to be working with the Rockefeller Foundation on this sound initiative to bridge a significant global leadership gap."

Making the eHealth Connection underscores the Rockefeller Foundation's commitment to unleashing human capacity and technological innovation to benefit poor and vulnerable people around the world. The conference extends the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center's tradition of bringing together people of diverse expertise and cultures in a neutral and thought-provoking environment to promote international understanding and encourage innovation and creativity.

Lagos, May 02, 2008 (Vanguard/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- On Tuesday, March 25, 2008 the Vanguard carried on its front page a story captioned "N-Delta: British, U.S., Nigerian Security experts meet today". The story was written by Emma Ujah.

Vanguard gave the story a front page prominence in the context of public interest in AFRICOM, the strategic importance of the Niger Delta Condition and the broadening of the involvement of foreign governments both at the Federal and now at the State level on matters of Nigeria's national security. The story was an effective summary of Government Communique on the impending meeting of experts, with minimal appreciation of the prospects of such an important security initiative.

This introduction flags the gap that exist between Government's policy of transparent conduct of its affairs, even in the security sector and the training required by the mass media, public and private for the discharge of such a responsibility.

Where on topics of this level of complexity Government seeks the involvement of the reading publics, it must also as a corollary interest seek ways of reducing the gap of understanding that exists between the governed and the Government on issues that are of such vital political and economic interests to the Nation.

One of the purposes of this News Analysis on GGESS is to draw attention to the need for training in democratic reporting on national security matters in general and on African statecraft issues in particular.

The GGESS Story

The following was the report on GGESS Meeting in Abuja, Tuesday March 25 2008 by Vanguard's Emma Ujah.

"Top American intelligence and military officers as well as their British counterparts will today in Abuja, engage top Nigerian security chiefs under the Gulf of Guinea Energy Security Strategy (GGESS) to explore fresh initiatives towards ending militancy in the Niger Delta region, in particular and a secured business environment in the entire Gulf of Guinea.

GGESS was initiated by the Federal Government in 2005 as a collaborative effort with key foreign governments to find a lasting solution to the security of oil and gas supply from the Niger Delta. It is also to promote sustainable development of the region in a climate of peace. Sources said government took the step in the appreciation that stability of the region is crucial to sustainable economic development of the nation and indeed of other countries that share in the oil and gas resources in the Gulf of Guinea.

If successfully implemented, the GGESS initiative is expected to be replicated in other countries in the subregion. The strategy seeks to build strong partnership between the Nigerian Government and foreign governments interested in the co-ordinated effort to stamp out theft, illegal small arms dealings and money laundering with particular emphasis on the Niger Delta.

At inception the US Government collaborated with Nigeria in establishing the GGESS. The United Kingdom which initially attended meetings as an observer joined the group as a full member. Nigerian representation to the GGESS is drawn from the NNPC, the Nigerian Military and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The Secretariat of the GGESS currently resides in the NNPC.

As a result of the achievements of the initiative, significant interest was shown by other nations and international organizations. The group now includes the Government of Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. The groups development partners, also includes the USAID, DFID, UNDP, and the EU. The GGESS has four work groups to facilitate the achievement of set objective: the Small Arms Control, Maritime Security, Money laundering and Sustainable Development.

The Small Arms and Maritime Security Sub-Working Group focus on developing and deploying strategies aimed at controlling the proliferation of small arms and the achievement of maritime domain awareness in the region to stem kidnappings, pipeline vandalism and crude theft among others. The Money Laundering Sub-Working Group works closely with EFFC to ensuring that Nigeria is rid of money laundering activities, thereby returning the country to the path of transparency and accountability.

Working closely with USAID and DFID on Sustainable Development the focus has been to support implementation of strategies of state governments. The Group has met eight times and the next meeting will be the 9th in the series and the second in Nigeria.

Since its advent in May 2005, the GGESS Group has made meaningful progress in terms of devising and implementing strategies in the key areas of (its) activities. In the areas of sustainable Development, the group achieved a significant success in bringing on board the Government of Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers States under the umbrella of the States Sustainable Development Strategy".

The entire report has been reproduced to highlight the structure of GGESS membership its functions and objectives.

The GGESS structure and functioning units could be diagrammatized as below:

For an organization formed in the penultimate years of the Obasanjo Administration and functioning in the crisis turbulence of the April 14-21, 2007 Elections, the course of politics in Nigeria and Nigerian politics establishes the context of GGESS and determines its prospects.

The attainment of its goals are directly linked to the interacting courses of politics in Africa and Nigerian politics whether these be;- ending militancy in the Niger Delta region;- securing business environment of the Gulf Guinea;- finding a lasting solution to the security of oil and gas supply from the Niger Delta;- promoting sustainable development of the region in a climate of peace;- ensuring the stability of the region in furtherance of sustainable economic development of the nation and those of other countries that share in the oil and gas resources in the Gulf of Guinea;- coordinating efforts to stamp out oil theft, illegal small arms dealings and money laundering with particular emphasis on the Niger delta;- developing strong partnerships with other governments.

The above equally applies to GGESS operational and functional foci namely:- Small Arms Control;- Maritime Security;- Money Laundering;- Sustainable Development.

These tasks are security politics driven and must be accomplished within the course or process of security politics in the region.- GGESS's strategic domain of policy, the Gulf of Guinea is defined by the Niger Delta for the Gulf of Guinea Region; the Niger Delta exemplifies, the role of sub-regions pivotal to the national and global energy economies.

GGESS as an inter-governmental energy based collective security organization is thus premised upon the stability of the African governments of the Gulf of Guinea Subregion.

It is appropriate and prudent that it is a partnership initiated by the Nigerian Government. Yet GGESS as an initiative whose effectiveness is premised upon the stability of incumbency of offices of Gulf Guinea Governments is bureaucratically operationalised by the host governments, whose hostness is defined by its Niger Delta Oil and Gas Economy. The challenge to be frontally addressed is an implication of this bureaucratic organization of the Host Government's participation and interest in GGESS.

The goals as identified are expressive of a commitment by its authors to a particular resolution of the conflicts in the Niger Delta of the Gulf of Guinea in general and of Nigeria's Niger Delta as the paradigm exemplification of the Gulf of Guinea Oil and Gas Economy on the other hand.

The question that is to be answered is what is left out when the GGESS initiative is organized as an inter-governmental one, given the course of politics in the Niger Delta? Such a structure of concerns is functional for the foreign partners and the developmental partners that are not plagued by regime instability resulting in discontinuities in governmental incumbency and policies. For the Gulf of Guinea governments the politics of the region are security politics and its course or modalities is the context of the structuring and functioning of governments.

The parties contesting for regime change and control of governments must be featured in the design and operations of GGESS and this is why governments as constitutional entities must be differentiated from governments as the issue and context of politics as they indeed are in the Gulf of Guinea Region.

The parties whose politics determine the security conflicts cannot be treated as objects of security policy because some are the Administrators of governments challenged by other parties with similar incumbency ambitions. It is the politics of these parties that determine the security conflicts in each of the constituent country of GGESS. Security Conflicts are not independent of the parties, they are the nature of the relations among the parties; to address security conflicts you have to address the parties in conflicts for these conflicts describe the political behaviour of the parties.

This is why security conflicts make the interactions of parties both context of security analyses and objects of such analysis. Security conflicts are the interactions of the parties that determine incumbency of governments and the character of the relationship between party chieftains and their bureaucratic officialdoms. Stability of incumbency determines continuity of control of policy making and implementation process.

Thus the primary objective of the GGESS initiative is that of determining continuity of incumbency to ensure strong stable and sustainable inter-governmental partnership. Partnerships relevant in the GGESS process are not formalistic contractual engagement but statecraft driven. One size fits all strategy will not do in the Niger Delta.

There partisan equity issues stemming from partisan control of government and development statecraft strategies must be devised through participant observation involvements. Nigeria's development partners need to learn what Zoellick has come to appreciate - the need for honesty and modesty on the part of "development providers".

The World Bank President Robert Zoellick reporting on Africa's encouraging economic performance to the 2007 Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governor's of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), summarized his reading of Africa's proposals before the International Development Community thusly:

"These countries want assistance to build infrastructure for higher growth - especially energy and physical facilities that can support regional integration. They also want us to help local financial markets, including micro finance that can mobilize African savings for Africans, he said.

Zoellick said the challenge however remained good governance, strong anti-corruption measures and expanding local public sector capacity. According to him, greater investment in technological resource and dissemination, sustainable land management, agricultural supply chains, irrigation, rural micro-credit, and policies that strengthen market opportunities and assistance with rural vulnerabilities and insecurities were areas that Africa countries needed to focus on.

The World Bank President noted that the Bank was concerned about the breakdown of states coming out of conflict. He pointed out that when the visionaries at Bretton Woods conceived the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IBRD, (now World Bank) over 60 years ago, the "R" stood for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan, adding that the 'R' pointed the institution towards the challenge of reconstruction in states harmed by conflicts.

He admitted that the bank's knowledge of handling conflicts was modest which required a new approach. "Frankly, our understanding of how to deal with these devastated cases is modest at best. I suspect we will need a more integrated approach involving security, political framework, rebuilding local capacity with quick support, reintegration of refugees, and more flexible development assistance.

Zoellick harped on the need for globalization to benefit the world's poor, most of whom come from developing countries, adding that poor countries are more at risk from the impact of climate change...

On what it takes to achieve inclusive and sustained growth he said, "This challenge requires humility and intellectual honesty. Many development schemes and dreams have failed. This is not a reason to quit trying. It is cause to focus continually and rigorously on results and on assessments for effectiveness" (ThisDay, Tuesday, October 23, 2007- "World Bank: 25 Countries Record Impressive Growth, pp 1 and 6).

Zoellick's statement of the statecraft challenge faced by the development community in the Global South in general and in Africa in particular is vividly described in his crisp and erudite policy analyses.

He identified the principal constraint on World Bank's effectiveness of response to the challenge - inadequacy of knowledge on reconstruction of societies coming out of conflicts. In his focus on the "R" in the IBRD he is honest to point out that the Bretton Woods visionaries had in mind the reconstruction of Europe and Japan, not the reconstruction of Empires or provinces of the same emerging as new countries through their Independence.

The World riven by the war of 1939 - 1945 was the war of global and regional empires waged by imperial governments. Europe was a region of nations with global empires and Japan was a regional empire with global aspirations. The IBRD was created as a post war agency to reconstitute the global economy towards its restoration and development.

Adapting the IBRD for reconstruction and development of the Global South in general and of the African region in particular may involve much more than adaptation. The challenges of country formation and economic development do entail the development of new knowledge, rather than the enriching of existing knowledge of how Europe and Japan were reconstructed for the development of the global economy.

The need for such new knowledge of global changes outside of the radar of the Bretton Woods post world war architects is fearlessly acknowledged by Robert Zoellick and the purpose to be served by the development of the World Bank, the purpose listed in what the Global South expects of the World Bank, is urgent and vital towards bridging the gap between the Global North and the Global South.

The dynamics of regime change politics in Africa must therefore be appreciated. The call for the cultivation of knowledge of politics in Africa entails an honest appraisal of the received stock of knowledge on the politics of change in Africa. The history of empire making in Africa for the enhancement of African country formation statecraft is an undertaking presently appreciated by a few intellectually and emotionally committed to the effective discharge of what Zoellick recognizes as a task of strategic and urgent importance.

Learning is not only for our partners - our governments also must learn how to address the issue of effective management and resolution of security conflicts stemming from country formation and state making security politics. Mismanagement of security conflicts are of grave consequence for poverty alleviation and elimination in the Niger Delta in particular and in Nigeria in general.

Harare, Jan 28, 2008 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The introduction of the new Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa will have serious social, economic and agricultural implications on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who are the majority in Africa, development experts have warned.

Agronomists, agro-ecologists, environmentalists and development experts who met in Mali at a conference on Climate Change, Agriculture, Fisheries and Pastoralism in Africa, urged African governments to reject this project which got US$150 million funding from its main handlers -- the Rockerfeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to improve African seed and distribution over the next five years.

"AGRA ignores the many successful agro-ecological and non-corporate approaches to agricultural development," said Eric Holt-Gimenez of the Institute for Food and Development Policy, commonly known as Food First.

"AGRA will undermine Africa's food sovereignty and kill its cultural diversity and agriculture."

AGRA was unveiled on September 12, 2006, by the Rockefeller and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations to improve seed hybrids, inorganic fertilizers, water management and agricultural extension services in Africa.

The goal of this new agricultural project is to develop 100 new varieties in 5 years focusing on at least 10 different staple crops, which include maize, cassava, sorghum and millet.

AGRA's programmes are administered through the Programs for a Green Revolution in Africa which got an initial grant of close to US$30 million for selected countries in East, Southern and West Africa.

Mariam Mayet of the African Centre for Biosafety said the officers of AGRA and ProGRA will initially be key senior staff from the Rockefeller Foundation who will be based in Nairobi, Kenya.

The first major initiative of ProGRA, she said, is the Programme for Africa's Seed System intended to operate in 20 African countries. PASS will focus primarily on improvement and distribution of copy varieties, training of a new generation of plant breeders, seed distribution through seed companies, public community seed systems and public extension.

Provision of credit and training for small "middle men" agro-dealers for distribution of seeds, chemical and fertilizers will also be done.

Agricultural experts say a "green revolution" merely includes efforts aimed at increasing productivity of major food crops by incorporating scientific advances in plant breeding, development or expansion of supportive technologies and implementation of various reforms.

They say large-scale investment in irrigation, application of chemical fertilizers and other inputs and farm equipment all make up a "green revolution."

Proponents of AGRA say Africa "missed the first Green Revolution" and hence the need to embrace this new alliance project. They feel strongly that Africa missed out on the Green Revolutions that took place in Asia and Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s.

They suggest that efforts aimed at improving food crop varieties through the use of fertilizers, irrigation and farm equipment failed in Africa hence it is important for the continent to support this project to fight hunger and poverty.

AGRA is joining other multilateral institutions, G8 and other donor countries, international foundations and multinationals to invest in African agriculture.

African scientists, agricultural specialists, farmers' organization and civil society activists are calling for a total rejection of AGRA as they cite several key concerns.

They argue that the growing influence of powerful multinationals such as Monsanto, Bayer, DuPont, Dow Chemical Company, BASF and Syngenta will lead to an extensive investment in genetically modified hybrids and "suicide" seeds, which make farmers lose their indigenous and affordable seeds.

Monsanto, for example, controls 88 percent of global transgenic seed production. "There is not any other reality," said Holt-Gimenez.

"This new Green Revolution is meant to perpetuate slavery and dependence on the major US seed companies. A new AGRA project in Africa means a new market for their seed."

"These multinationals are only speaking about profits and poisons. They are not speaking about the culture and needs of the Global South farmers," he said. "The wisdom of all farmers in the Global South and indigenous communities is not taken into account. They are promoting mono-cropping at the expense of promoting agro-biodiversity," he added.

Added Renato T Salazar, a South East Asia Regional Initiative for Community Empowerment senior fellow: "We must come out strongly and inform the political side and farmers about the badness of AGRA in Africa. The Green Revolutions that were implemented in Asia in the 1960s and 1970s had disastrous effects."

"Prescription from AGRA will not work. The simplest solution to this project is to reject it," said Dr Regassa Feyissa, a veteran Ethiopian plant researcher.

Opponents say, beyond the yield gains from Green Revolution projects, there are many costs -- economic, agricultural and social. The use of large amounts of water, fertilizers and chemicals impoverishes the soil, leaving it less fertile and heavily polluted. Apart from health hazards, there are also human health implications.

The biodiversity kept by farmers for ages is lost and this forces farmers to depend heavily on pesticides and seed supplied by multinationals.

"The profound cultural and economic changes wrought by the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s produced a massive rural exodus and with it, a profound loss of traditional knowledge and skills," Grain, a Food First publication reported.

"The Green Revolution is based on a scientific reductionism, which has resulted in monocultures, the use of chemicals, fertilizers and inappropriate mechanization. This is alien to Africa's peasant farming systems which pursues a more holistic approach to agriculture in which crops are combined with livestock, organic manure is used, soils are looked after and there is a deep respect for the wider environment."

There are so many questions that need to be asked. How will AGRA address the lessons learned from the last Green Revolution in Asia in the 1960s and 1970s? Who sets the agenda for AGRA? Is accountable to African farmers and does it place their interest first? Will this project benefit African farmers or big multinationals, who will benefit most?

"The Green Revolution is a serious threat to the continent's peasants, seeds and livelihoods," said Diamantino Nhampossa of Mozambique's National Peasants Union and Via Campensina in Africa. "Instead of recognising the rich knowledge that peasant women and men have managed for millennia, the introduction of hybrid seeds and technological packages will further damage the peasants own production systems."

The winner of the Green Revolution projects from 1970-1990 is the US, which got revenue amounting to US$10,2 billion through seed and chemical sales by its multinationals.

Opponents say the biggest loser was the environment.

They say two-thirds of agricultural land worldwide has been affected by soil erosion, the green revolution has led to the salification of 70 million acres of land and the creation of Dead Zones in the Gulf of Mexico and Israel and other parts of the world.

Salazar said in Asia, the negative effects of the Green Revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s included the loss of indigenous rice landraces, dependence on external inputs, loss of control of indigenous agricultural science and technology, increased pests resistance, loss of genetic diversity and loss of farmers' innovation using indigenous knowledge systems passed on from one generation to the other.

"We need to learn from each other. The learning process is the one that empowers and can help us to promote and rehabilitate alternative approaches which farmers in the Global South have," he said. Renowned Ethiopian geneticist Dr Melaku Worede said: "There's so much potential with seeds in Africa that is not being explored. It's being undermined by outside solutions. Rather than the industrial agriculture model, we should support more holistic approaches to agriculture. Farmer-led programmes tend to look at more than just yields. There are about raising productivity without losing biodiversity."

Opponents of AGRA say African farmers have sophisticated crop and livestock breeding and ecosystem technologies and their own research networks. They argue that only farmer-led agricultural and rural development initiatives that build upon existing working systems can lead to real improvement. In the end, the issue is not so much about what can be introduced into Africa but about what needs to be done to strengthen the continent's resilient food production and ecosystem methods. Money, resources, new technologies and new imported projects alone cannot be a panacea to hunger and poverty in Africa.

There is a complex interaction of various factors that have to be taken into account to improve food security and food sovereignty in Africa.

And as Dr Melaku Worede rightly puts says: "We need to build from the strengths of the farmers. Our work shows that farmers are the best breeders and the best judges of new agricultural projects."

Harare, Dec 17, 2007 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- RICH countries in the northern hemisphere are drawing up ambitious renewable fuel targets, diverting attention from powerful economic interests that are reaping huge rewards from the biofuels boom while avoiding discussion of the heavy price people in the global South are paying, to maintain the consumptive oil-based lifestyles of the North.

Agronomists, ecologists, environmentalists and development activists who met recently in Mali at a conference on Climate Change, Agriculture, Fisheries and Pastoralism in Africa called on African governments to resist pressure from the North to grow food crops for the production of biodiesel.

TD 
	

"The push for agro-fuels is the latest of these so-called 'solutions' that is extensively promoted as an opportunity for Africa to develop energy security and alleviate poverty in rural areas," an official of the African Biodiversity Network said.

He warned that global biofuel developments are going to have a huge impact on the African continent as powerful multinationals are ganging up for the huge stakes in the biodiesel production sector.

More than 150 participants from 25 African countries and 10 countries from other continents participated at this conference where they shared information and viewpoints on the emerging and controversial issues of agro-fuels and food supply system.

Zimbabwe commissioned a biodiesel plant recently and the Minister of Science and Technology Development, Dr Olivia Muchena, said the country would not allow the use of food crops to produce biodiesel.

She said Zimbabwe's biodiesel project would utilise jatropha, a multi-purpose tree grown in marginal areas.

Despite this assurance, it is important for Zimbabweans to know what critics say about the agro-fuels debate. This will at least help our policymakers to see the other side of the agro-fuels debate.

The Mali conference generated ardent debate and development experts called for the use of appropriate terms.

They argued that the term biofuels should be used to describe the traditional use of biological materials for fuel such as wood, dung, bagasse, etc while the term agro-fuels should be used to refer to the process of specifically growing crops on a large scale to produce fuels.

"New large-scale agro-fuels projects are mushrooming across Africa. Africa is being told that biofuels exports will be good for development, good for the economy and good for the environment.

"There is a high level of enthusiasm for these new developments as African governments hope that agro-fuels initiatives will lift their countries out of poverty by providing the fuels that Europe craves while hoping it will improve energy security in Africa at the same," the ABN said.

ABN says there have, however, been several warnings that agro-fuels may bring more problems than they can solve.

"We have seen how palm oil plantations are leading to the destruction of the rainforest in Indonesia, how soya and sugar cane plantations are leading to the cutting down of (trees in) the Amazon in Brazil and grain prices around the world have escalated because of the 'ethanol effect'," the Network said.

"At the same time, the genetically modified (organisms) industry is positioning itself to ensure that agro-fuels become an entry point into a continent that has so far mostly resisted GM crop commercialisation."

Eric Holt-Gimenez of the Institute for Food and Development Policy, commonly known as Food First, led highly charged discussions on the myth of the supposed benefits of agro-fuels.

He said the agro-fuels push by rich countries "obscures the political-economic relationships between land, people, resources and food and fails to help us understand the profound consequences of the industrial transformation of our food and fuel systems.

"Agro-fuels better describes the industrial interests behind the transformation and is the term most widely used in the global South. Industrialised countries started the biofuels boom by demanding ambitious renewable fuel targets. These fuels are to provide 5,75 percent of Europe's transport power by 2010 and 10 percent by 2020. The United States wants 35 billion gallons a year.

"These targets far exceed the agricultural capacities of the industrial North. Europe would need to plant 70 percent of its farmland with fuel crops. The entire corn and soya harvest of the US would need to be processed as ethanol and biodiesel. Converting most arable land to fuel crops would destroy the food systems of the North, so the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development countries are looking to the South to meet demand."

Rich countries in the North will never surrender their food sovereignty to the countries in the global South but ironically they want countries in the South to surrender theirs while maintaining their own.

Holt-Gimenez told the conference that the rapid capitalisation and concentration of power within the agro-fuels industry is breathtaking with venture capital investment in biofuels rising by 800 percent.

Private investment, he said, is swamping public research institutions as evidenced by BP's recent award of half a billion dollars to the University of California.

"Behind the scenes and in open defiance of national anti-trust laws, giant oil, grain, auto and genetic engineering corporations are forming powerful partnerships -- ADM with Monsanto, Chevron and Volkswagen and BP with DuPont and Toyota," he said.

"These corporations are consolidating research, production, processing and distribution chains of our food and fuel system under one colossal industrial roof."

Holt-Gimenez argues further: "Agro-fuel champions assure us that because fuel crops are renewable, they are environmentally friendly, can reduce global warming and will foster rural development. But, the tremendous market power of agro-fuel corporations, coupled with weak political will of governments to regulate their activities is a recipe for environmental disaster and increasing hunger in the global South."

The Mali conference also deliberated and examined the myths of the agro-fuels boom.

Proponents of the agro-fuels boom say that agro-fuels are "clean and green" because the photosynthesis process from fuel crops removes greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and can reduce fossil fuel consumption.

Critics, however, argued that when the full "life cycle" of agro-fuels is considered -- from land clearing to automotive consumption, the moderate emissions savings are undone by far greater emissions from deforestation, burning, peat drainage, cultivation and soil carbon losses and high rates of soil erosion.

The second belief is that agro-fuels will not result in deforestation as proponents of agro-fuels argue that fuel crops planted on ecologically degraded lands will improve rather than destroy the environment.

However, critics say the introduction of agro-fuel plantations will simply push indigenous people and subsistence farmers out of their lands. In Brazil, for example, the biodiverse ecosystems of the Mata Atlantica, the Cerrado and the Pantanal indigenous communities have been re-classified as "degraded" land suitable for agro-fuel plantations.

The communities are being pushed to the "agricultural frontier" of the Amazon where deforestation will intensify. Soyabeans supply 40 percent of Brazil's diesel fuels. Palm oil plantations for biodiesel are the primary cause of forest loss in Indonesia while Malaysia, the world's largest producer of palm oil, has lost a massive 87 percent of its tropical forests.

The third myth: "Agro-fuels will bring rural development." In reality, critics say the energy-hungry corporations of the North are pouring money into Africa for agro-fuel crop production fuelling a land rush "reminiscent of Europe's initial colonial expansion". They argue that the market power of corporations such as Cargill and ADM, Monsanto and Syngenta allows them to extract profits without meaningful benefits to the African farmers.

"Agro-fuels growers will be increasingly dependent on this oligopoly of companies. Farmers are not likely to receive many benefits. Smallholders will likely be forced off the land," Holt-Gimenez told the conference.

He said hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the soyabean plantations in southern Brazil, northern Argentina and eastern Bolivia. "All this (agro-fuels boom) is built on grand mythology. Instead of driving less, consuming less, rich countries are consuming more and this will not solve the problem."

Said Mariam Mayet of the African Centre for Biosafety: "I don't think we should fool ourselves that Africa is going to benefit from agro-fuels. Agro-fuels are introducing another subtle and hardened form of capitalism with same oil multinationals, who are already benefiting eyeing to reap huge profits from the growing of agro-fuels in Africa."

She said the large-scale growing of jatropha contradicts with the whole paradigm of food sovereignty. "We really need to do our homework and do geo-political mapping to follow-up trends on who is investing where, doing what and for what interests."

The other myths peddled by proponents of agro-fuels include the belief that agro-fuels will not cause hunger and that "better 'second-generation' agro-fuels are just around the corner." Critics argue that hunger will worsen as high fuel prices push up food prices because food and fuel crops are competing for land and resources.

More farmers will opt to grow agro-fuel crops, which could turn out to be more profitable than food production leading to pressures on farmers and large multinationals to increase production of agro-fuel crops to the detriment of food crops. Critics warn that the consequences of using crop material for the production of fuel is likely to create food insecurity especially in Africa where sugar, maize, soya, sunflower are mainly used for food.

They also fear that large producers and the large multinationals are increasingly carving out areas in Africa for agro-fuels production taking up fertile areas that would normally be best for food production.

Agro-ecologists said it is important to enhance many successful, locally focused energy-efficient and people-centred alternatives of producing food and fuel in ways that do not threaten food systems, the environment or the livelihoods of farmers in Africa.

"The conclusion is pretty much the same across the board: 'the push for agro-fuels amounts to nothing less than the re-introduction and re-enforcement of the old colonial plantation economy, redesigned to function under the rules of the modern neo-liberal, globalised world," said Grain, an international organisation promoting the sustainable use and management of agro-biodiversity.

"Indigenous farming systems, local communities and the biodiversity they manage have to give way to provide for the increased fuel needs of the industrialised world."

In the end, even though the justification for the production of agrofuels is to combat climate change, Holt-Gimenez said: "The question is not whether ethanol and bio-diesel have a place in the future but whether or not to allow a handful of global corporations to impoverish the planet and the majority of the people.

"This is the last struggle for the peasants (struggle to resist the marginalisation of the poor by multinationals racing to acquire large tracts of land for agro-fuels production). This is the last big push to get rid of the peasants."

HD 	Anglicans And Episcopal Church Pull Apart Over Gay Issue

Nairobi, Sep 03, 2007 (The Nation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --

Protracted differences in the global Anglican Church over gay relationships have finally seen the Kenyan province ordain its own bishops to serve in America.

TD 
	

The Rev Canon Dr Will (Bill) Atwood and the Rev William Murdoch's ordination last Thursday was a response to the action taken by the Protestant Episcopal Church to openly ordain gays as priests, a move vehemently opposed by a group of the Anglican Communion concentrated in Africa and Asia - also referred to as the Global South.

In 2003, the Episcopal Church - the Anglican body in the U.S. - ordained the Rev Gene Robinson, who is a gay, as the bishop of New Hampshire. The action was met with disapproval from church followers around the world opposed to gay relationships.

The division threat in the church pits some wealthy provinces in the Communion - notably USA and Canada in North America - against the Global South. The latter carefully guards the traditional Anglican faith which views homosexuality as sin.

The group bases its uncompromising stance on the Gospel of Jesus Christ and maintains that God only approves intimate relations between man and woman.

Suffragan bishops

In ordaining the two American clergymen as suffragan bishops, the Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK) was saying it could no longer trust its flock in the U.S. to remain safe in the hands of American Anglican priests who seem to possess unorthodox faith.

According to Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi, who presided over the ordination ceremony at the All Saints Cathedral, American bishops rejected a proposal by primates (heads of churches in various countries) to have a pastoral council to support Anglican traditionalists, leaving Kenya with no options but to seek measures of safeguarding its flock in the U.S.

Explaining his disappointment against the U.S. church, Archbishop Nzimbi said the global church has since 1844 when the Anglican missionaries started planting the Anglican seeds, rejoiced in the trustworthy testimony of the Holy Scriptures.

The Kenyan archbishop said the fabric of the 72-member Anglican Communion worldwide had been torn by the actions of the Episcopal Church. It was evident, he stated, that the conflicts in the communion affected all Anglican followers in the world and they had to respond.

Eleven heads of the Anglican Church in various provinces (countries/regions) attended the ceremony. Their participation was a clear testimony of the opposition the Global South communion is wielding against its American counterpart over the gay issue. A team of 39 from the US including families of the two bishops also flew into the country for the ceremony. Nineteen ACK Bishops were also present.

Uganda's Anglican Church is also set to consecrate a second bishop this weekend, also to serve its interests in America.

But it has emerged that the church lacks clear authority structures to address the problem. Archbishop Greg Venables of the province of the Southern Cone of America said the church was facing a major crisis because of lack of official authority structures.

The situation, he said, had caused the Anglican Communion to reflect and seek a resolution to the problem. He explained that he supported the decision to consecrate the two bishops because he believed faithful in America were entitled to receive proper Episcopal care.

ACK's top most decision making body (the Provincial Synod) consisting 34 ACK bishops and over 180 priests and lay persons approved the consecration in June.

The synod reaffirmed its stated position on same sex union noting that it only recognised marriage between a man and a woman and that homosexuality was unbiblical. The body rejected what it described as heretical teachings recently witnessed in the Episcopal Church.

ACK also bases its arguments on the 1998 Lambeth Conference, a meeting that is held once in 10 years by primates from all over the communion. It condemned gay relationships.

ACK's action was based on a request from its congregation in the U.S. In a meeting between Archbishop Nzimbi and the clergy and lay leaders of 17 American ACK congregations in January, they appealed to the archbishop to create a missionary diocese for the 30 US-based congregations of not only Kenyan expatriates but also American traditionalists under Kenyan jurisdiction.

The archbishop did promise the group that he would consult with other primates before taking any action, explaining to them that they had to move slowly and every step be made for the glory and honour of God.

At a press briefing held a day before the consecrations, the Rev Nzimbi said ACK had consulted broadly "to fulfil the Gospel of Jesus Christ and seek to pursue the highest level of unity that is possible." It had been concluded that an American coalition would provide a safe haven for those who maintain historic Anglican faith and practice, he said.

Some clergy in the USA are said to have been among the first organisations to welcome the bishops' consecration decision.

Major shift

In an interview with journalists, Archbishop of the West Indies Drexel Gomez said there has been a major shift in some parts of the world in the traditional understanding of the scriptures, particularly in the U.S. where a number of Anglican leaders are supporting gay relations.

Archbishop Gomez later delivered the sermon at the consecration service, attacking the US revolutionary church which he accused of corrupting the Gospel of Jesus and exchanging the truth for lies.

The primate said homosexual intercourse was an exchange of the truth for lies.

The two new bishops will be required to give sound and dedicated leadership to the ACK flock in the US and further the church's unity. They will collaborate with others in the common cause network to provide orthodox Episcopal care and oversight, strategically uniting a broad conservative coalition that shares historic Anglican faith and practice.

Their main mandate will be to support ACK's international interests including supporting the Kenyan clergy and congregations in North America. They are also expected to guide and strengthen the deacons and all others who minister in the church.

Nairobi, Jan 29, 2007 (The Nation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --

The motto of the just-concluded World Social Forum in Nairobi was "Another world is possible." Indeed that phrase is what the WSF is all about.

TD 
	

The whole reason for the Forum's existence is to create a world different to the one preached at the World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland. The WSF is held annually by members of the anti-globalisation brigade as an alternative to the meeting in Davos.

At the Forum activists share and refine strategies on how to organise against the excesses, as they see them, of the capitalist society.

The meeting in Nairobi marked the first time that the Forum has been held in Africa -- the world's poorest, yet potentially the world's wealthiest continent.

The WSF was initially convened in the Brazilian town of Porto Alegre by various local civil society groups in 2001. It has also been held in the Indian city of Mumbai in 2004.

The WSF meeting in Nairobi was expected by many to promote the voices of the common people and particularly those of Africa and the global South in general.

While, indeed, there were many different voices at the event, in the final analysis there were inequalities of representation with the global South having fewer representatives as opposed to over-representation of the North.

This led inevitably to a questioning of the bona fides of such lopsided representation. It seemed that while another world is possible, for now, it would remain the same old world where citizens of the global North continue to patronise those of the global South.

However, on another level, the WSF did manage to bring together an assorted bunch of activists from the worldwide civil society movement.

Kigali, Sep 24, 2006 (The New Times/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --

Global South Church will continue to advocate for peace and unity throughout the world, the Chairman of the Global South Provinces of the Anglican Communion and leader of the Church of Nigeria, Archbishop Peter Akinola, has said.

TD 
	

The Prelate said this on September 22 at Hotel des Milles Collines during a closing ceremony of a four-day Global South Anglican Communion meeting.

"As Global South religious leaders, we stand firm and say that advocacy for peace the world over will proceed till we defeat the power of Satan," Akinola said. "We prayed and wept at the mass grave of 250,000 helpless victims; we confronted the utter depravity and inhumanity to which we are all subject outside of the transforming grace of God."

He noted in a communique that the church is reminded again that faith in Christ must be active and appealed to the world to stand against the evil and violence that threaten to consume the world.

"We are very aware of the agonizing situation in the Sudan. We appreciate and commend the terms the Sudanese Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the North and the South," he said. "We dare not, however, close our eyes to the devastating situation in Darfur, and there must not be a continuation of the slaughter."

The Rwandan Anglican head, Archbishop Emmanuel Kolini, said that it is the obligation of the church to preach unity and reconciliation messages for the betterment of the world.

"The Global Church was overwhelmed of what befell Rwanda. It has resolved to use a strong voice and halt anything related to what happened in 1994," he said.

Kigali, Sep 20, 2006 (The New Times/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --

The Prime Minister Bernard Makuza has hailed leaders of the Global South Church for their role in advocating for peace and harmony the world over.

TD 
	

The Premier, who was September 20 speaking during the opening of the Global South Anglican Special Meeting at Hotel des Mille Collines, said: "Your spirit and contribution is based on collective responsibility and I urge you to cultivate a path for social unity."

"In view of the geographical distribution you are part of us," Makuza said and added: "As religious leaders you should advocate for peace and harmony for the stability of the world."

Makuza noted that freedom and love are cornerstones for social progress and urged the peace experts to support the drive for social stability.

"I share my determination to fight poverty with you, and I believe this will improve the lives of our people. Together, we can help to fight poverty and HIV/Aids for the good of the world," he added.

The Premier told the gathering that Rwanda has set a programme to fight poverty and observed that the action has attracted all stakeholders in the country.

"The best property that one can have is life," he observed.

The Chairman of the Global South Church and the leader of the Anglican Church of Nigeria, Archbishop Peter Akinola said the Global Church was defeated by what befell the nation during the 1994.

He vowed to keep praying for Rwandans for total peace. "The Global Church will continue to pray for Rwanda and I hope this will make reconciliation a success," Akinola said.

He added that the three day Global South meeting currently going on in Kigali will also find ways for economic empowerment in the world community.

HD 	Fraction of Oil Profits Sought for Poorest Nations

United Nations, Aug 24, 2006 (Inter Press Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --

The world's 50 poorest nations -- ranging from Cape Verde and Haiti to Nepal and Sierra Leone -- are turning to the major oil-producing nations for urgently needed assistance for development.

TD 
	

Anwarul Karim Chowdhury, U.N. under-secretary-general for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), has proposed that oil-producing nations should consider earmarking just 10 cents per barrel from their rising incomes for infrastructure development in LDCs in the next 10 years.

"This is a part of our efforts to secure new sources of development finance for LDCs," Chowdhury told IPS. "We need an expressed willingness on the part of producers and companies directly involved in oil production."

"If major charities like the Gates Foundation, Bennet Foundation, Turner Foundation and Soros Foundation can decide in recent years to focus on the neediest countries, why not oil producers, whose revenues have multiplied in a big way?" Chowdhury said.

The 50 LDCs, described as the poorest of the world's poor, include 34 countries in Africa, such as Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Comoros, Malawi, Mali, Liberia, Rwanda and Somalia.

As oil incomes generate massive currency reserves in countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Iran, the United Nations says that gross export revenues in the Middle East alone are expected to reach over 400 billion dollars in 2006 compared with 307 billion dollars in 2005.

This is based on an average price of about 57 dollars per barrel, according to a U.N. study released last April. But since then, oil prices have hit over 70 dollars per barrel -- tripling since 2001.

If the world's top 17 oil producing countries -- including Algeria, Canada, Venezuela, China, Norway, Mexico, Indonesia and the United States -- earmark 10 cents per barrel for LDCs, the amount per month could reach as high as 17.6 million dollars on a total income of 176.6 million dollars, according to a chart prepared by Chowdhury's office.

Chowdhury told IPS there is already a precedent set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), whose "remarkable action" in favour of LDCs in the mid-1980s resulted in a decision to "pick up the tab for the contribution of all LDCs to the newly-created Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) based in Amsterdam." He said the OPEC Fund is still continuing to do this.

"LDCs already have many un-funded or under-funded infrastructure projects which could be supported by new money, when available," he added.

Chowdhury, who made the formal proposal at a recent meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in Geneva, is hoping for a positive reaction from oil producers. But there have been no firm commitments so far.

One Arab diplomat told IPS that Qatar, a country rich in oil and gas reserves, initiated a special fund last year to help the 132 members of the Group of 77 developing nations, which includes the 50 LDCs.

"But most of the Middle Eastern oil-producing nations are currently preoccupied helping the reconstruction of war-devastated Lebanon," he added.

Arun Karki, president of LDC Watch based in Nepal, told IPS he "strongly supports" the proposal made by Chowdhury. "This will help raise a special fund without affecting any other earmarked development funding."

He said there should also be other "innovative sources of funding" for LDCs development. "One good example is the current surcharge on airline tickets," he added.

Bill Fletcher, Jr., a visiting professor at Brooklyn College in the City University of New York and former president of TransAfrica Forum, told IPS that in the 1970s, the oil shock devastated many non-oil producing countries in the global South, including some countries that stood in solidarity with the Arab oil embargo of 1973.

"This devastation had a long-lasting impact on the living standards in the global South. It is, therefore, correct today to ask of the oil producing countries that they do put aside a certain percentage of oil income to assist development in the global South," he added.

Fletcher pointed out that Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez has demonstrated how oil can be a vehicle for support rather than strangulation.

"At the same time we must recognise that it is the largely the oil companies that must be scrutinised. The massive profits they have gained in the last year -- as prices continued to increase -- demonstrate the completely amoral attitude that oil companies take toward the world's peoples and issues of energy necessity," he added.

Most political parties and institutions will rhetorically go after the oil companies but shy away from any significant practical steps to recoup even a portion of the massive gains that these companies have secured, he said.

Anuradha Mittal of the Oakland Institute said that hunger and poverty in poorer nations is really a paradox in a world of plenty.

"The latest U.N. proposal for oil-producing nations to earmark a mere 10 cents per barrel for infrastructure development in the LDCs is an attempt to address growing inequities. However, one has to be cautious given the past record," she told IPS.

As far back as the 1970s, the U.N. General Assembly urged the world's 22 richest countries to provide 0.7 percent of their gross national product (GNP) as overseas development assistance (ODA) to developing nations, but only five countries have met this target: Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

She said the United States, which spends 0.1 percent of its GNP on aid, has not even provided a timeframe to reach the U.N. target, or set goals for interim targets, putting Washington last among the 22 major nations.

Also, aid as a fraction of rich country income is not a meaningful measure of the adequacy of aid flows.

"It would be far better to estimate aid needs by starting on the recipient side with a meaningful model of how aid affects development," she added.

Meanwhile, in report to the next session of the General Assembly in September, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan says that despite improved economic performance, "Extreme poverty appears to be decreasing in very few of the LDCs, and increasing in many."

"In unprecedented reversal of historical trends, life expectancy is declining in several LDCs, most affected by HIV/AIDS and civil strife."

He also points out that climate change is emerging as "a new challenge to sustainable development of the LDCs, in particular those in Africa and the small islands."

Prepared by the Geneva-based U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, the 27-page report says that most LDCs are constrained by many factors: structural weaknesses of their economies; limited human, institutional, technical, trade and productive capacity; inadequate infrastructure and unsustainable external debt.

Two years ago in Cancun, the issue of the damage done to African cotton producers by rich-country subsidies sparked the breakdown of world trade talks, highlighting the failure of rich countries to make this round of trade talks a "development round." In Geneva last week, African countries warned that their interests were still being ignored.

This AfricaFocus Bulletin contains a report from Third World Network on the statements by cotton-producing countries at talks in Geneva, a more general report from Focus on the Global South on developing country views of the stalled talks, and excerpts from another report from Third World Network on the latest negotiations.

African Cotton Countries Demand Concrete Results at Hongkong

Third World Network

http://www.twnside.org.sg

By Tetteh Hormeku (TWN Africa) Geneva, 19 Oct 2005

Representatives of the West African cotton-producing countries have demanded a concrete resolution of the cotton problem at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, as well as a clear indication now that this will be the case, if they are to have any stake in outcomes of the Conference.

Speaking to the press at the WTO on Wednesday, the West African countries said that in the absence of such concrete results, the developed countries whose policies have led to the cotton crisis will be responsible if the cotton countries are unable to accept an overall deal in Hong Kong.

The message was delivered by the Ministers of Trade and Industry of Mali and Chad, the President of the Burkina Faso National Union of Cotton Producers, and the President of the Cotton Producers Association of Africa.

Introducing the issue at the press conference, the Malian Minister, Mr Choguel Kokalla Maiga, said that the African cotton producers have no choice but to demand a resolution of the cotton problem.

Resolution of their problem is their single interest in the on-going negotiations, compared to other countries which have multiple interests that can be traded off. He explained that their countries are dependent on the single commodity of cotton, whereas the EU and the US have other products available to them, and they also have the means to resolve the crisis arising from their policies.

Explaining the strategic role of cotton in their economies, Maiga stated that cotton constituted 40% of total exports of their countries, 60% of agricultural exports, and up to 10% of their GDP.

The minister recalled that when they brought up the cotton issue in Cancun, there had been no solution. Since Cancun, there had been a lot of discussion and workshops on the cotton issue, but again there was no progress up to now.

In July 2004, as part of the July framework, WTO members agreed to treat the case of cotton specifically, expeditiously and ambitiously. But up to now there is no understanding of what these terms mean, in terms of operationalising them.

Although there were only a few weeks before the Hong Kong Ministerial, there was still no solution.

The principal countries especially the US and EU have all submitted proposals on agriculture, and yet not one of these have even mentioned the case of cotton. "The cotton countries are thus faced with the risk that the Hong Kong Ministerial will offer us only empty words and we will leave empty handed from Hong Kong. This will be unacceptable," he stated.

The cotton countries, therefore, need a clear statement before members arrive at Hong Kong as to how the Hong Kong meeting will address the cotton issue, said the Minister, adding that a concrete and operational resolution to the cotton problem must be part of the decisions taken at Hong Kong, otherwise the countries cannot see how they can have an interest in those decisions.

"We don't want to be held responsible if there is a failure in Hong Kong," he said, adding that the US, EU and other countries had the means to prevent a failure.

Asked whether this meant that the countries are prepared to block a deal in Hong Kong, the Minister explained that it is not up to any particular country to take upon themselves the responsibility to block negotiations. However, a negotiation can be blocked as a result of the failure to find solutions to legitimate problems. "If there is no solution, we cannot see what our interests will be in the negotiations," he reiterated.

He stated further that their countries are being put in the unacceptable situation of having to chose between blocking a deal in Hong Kong or accepting a bad deal. He said that their demands were perfectly legitimate. They were not asking for any special treatment or favours, but simply asking that the rules of the WTO be applied.

Asked further to comment on the US argument that subsidies on cotton were not linked to the production and on the issue of box shifting, the Minister stated that debates about the colours of boxes was interesting as an intellectual exercise but is of little relevance to the cotton countries. "If other farmers (in rich countries) are getting large subsidies, then whatever colour the subsidies are said to be - whether blue or amber or green - makes no difference."

The relevant question, he said, is whether "we can or cannot produce for the international market, due to these subsidies."

Mr. Maiga said the countries' demands are that a clear date be fixed to completely eliminate the subsidies, and that in the meantime, their producers must be compensated for the huge losses they have suffered from the subsidies.

He criticised the big countries for being concerned in the current negotiations with solving their own problems, and then they ask the small countries to accept whatever they have decided. "We can't accept this," he stressed.

Mrs Ngarmbatina Soukate, Minister of Trade and Industry of Chad, stressed that what their countries were looking for in the WTO is the resolution of the cotton issue. "It is our life," she said.

She added that it was important for their countries to know before going to Hong Kong that they will come back with concrete results, otherwise their countries cannot even dare to go to Hong Kong. "We don't want declarations, we need something concrete to give to our farmers," she stressed.

There had been a lot of sympathy in words so far, she added, but no concrete measures to address the issue.

Quoting an African proverb that people who are hungry do not need philosophy but action, she stated that the cotton countries need to be able to explain to their farmers after Hong Kong what the OECD countries are willing to do to reduce their subsidies and what that will mean for the farmers.

"This is why we are here at the WTO, we plead to all concerned to stop beating around the bush and instead tell us what you are going to do."

Ibrahim Malloum, President of the Cotton Producers Association of Africa, drew attention to the fact that cotton produced in West Africa is of the highest quality and had very competitive costs. It was linked to the lives of over 15 million, but unfortunately, instead of leading to the development of the people, cotton has become part of their impoverishment due to the low prices which the producers receive as result of the subsidies paid to cotton producers in the OECD countries.

"In the OECD countries, production is not influenced by market forces, as the farmers get a good price whatever the prices in the market. We are facing unacceptable competition," he said.

He said that at the WTO Cancun meeting, everyone had accepted that their countries had made the moral and legal case for redressing the situation. He reiterated that the cotton countries are asking simply for the rules of the WTO to be applied.

He added that there are four issues to be addressed in Hong Kong: ( 1) urgent action on domestic and export subsidies; ( 2) a date to be fixed for an end to all subsidies; ( 3) a decision to compensate the cotton producers for the huge losses they have suffered as a result of the subsidies, which he estimated as $250 million in direct costs and $1 billion including indirect costs; and ( 4) cotton must be treated outside of agriculture as it is a strategic case.

In a similar vein, Mr Francois Traore, President of the Burkinabe National Association of Cotton Producers, stated that cotton was strategic for the development of their people.

He said the Western countries should be supporting the development of cotton in African countries so that the people can have a livelihood and stay in their own countries. Instead, the Western countries seem to prefer the present situation in which their subsidies destroy the prospects of the African cotton-producing countries, whose people are then forced by circumstances to migrate, and then they are forcibly repatriated.

He stated that it would be better to stay in Hong Kong after the Ministerial than return with an empty hand.

Ag Talks: African and Caribbean Delegates Angered by US Package Portrayed as "Progress"

"What the US has done is deceptive and misleading", delegate of a small country to the WTO, denouncing the public relations spin that the US and EU had made huge concessions.

In informal conversations with African and Caribbean delegates to the WTO, many countries have expressed anger at the public relations spin of the United States and EU, portraying their offers as huge concessions.

And they have reason to be. The current WTO defined "trade distorting subsidies" provided by the United States amount to about $21.5 billion. With the implementation of the US proposal, the US would still be able to provide up to about $23 billion in "trade- distorting" supports. (Note that these figures do not include the $51 billion US provides in the unlimited "Green Box", and the cotton panel has already established that certain payments in this box are trade-distorting.)

Two instruments that have allowed this "deception" to take place are:

The sacrosanct Green Box, where the bulk of subsidies will be housed, has been left untouched in these proposals. The US wants an expansion of the Blue Box which will allow them to announce cuts in the Amber Box, but shift a large portion of those reduced subsidies around 5 billion into the New Blue Box.

The result? Whilst export subsidies are said to be on the way out, hidden export subsidies have taken their place, and dumping in developing country markets continue. Small wonder that African and Caribbean delegates are incensed that these cosmetic "concessions" have been given so much fanfare at the WTO and in the press in the past week. Swirling all around them at the WTO is talk by the prominent players that "progress has been made".

These are some comments heard in the corridors made by the Africans and Caribbean delegates, gravely concerned by these developments:

"There seems to be this notion of progress. But I don't think in reality that progress is there. I don't think developing countries should be rushing into contributing to the process. The picture is being portrayed that we are moving. Everybody should come on board to move. We should say, "There is no movement". US seems content that the proposal has increased momentum, that if not for their proposal, nothing would have moved. They are expecting us to congratulate them. But there is nothing to congratulate about".

An African delegate, worried about the demands placed on them regarding market access cuts said,

"What is worrying is that the level of ambition (in market access / tariff cuts) is rising from the US and EU. I don't know if this is where some developing countries want to head. Those who feel it should go down should come in and say something. We are not seeing commensurate levels of ambition rising in export subsidies or domestic supports. We have no justification to raise levels in market access."

Many delegates have also expressed concern that whilst the market access talks have accelerated, discussion on the defensive instruments for developing countries (Special and Differential treatment S&D) have not:

"The prominent players are arguing that we need to knock together the main components, then deal with S&D (referring to the Special Products and Safeguard Mechanisms) because they don't know what the commitments by developing countries will be. But that is dangerous. Given the time factor, we will be rushed into S&D components, but not really get what we are looking for. We need to have these commitments addressed in parallel, otherwise, the results would be detrimental".

The African delegates have also underlined that they want cotton and commodities two key concerns of theirs - to be addressed, yet there has been no progress in these areas. One delegate also expressed great concern, indignation and anger that the Chair of Agriculture had suggested to those who had put forward a paper on commodities, that this issue could be deferred till after Hong Kong.

An African delegate characterized the events as a "backward movement, not a forward movement".

A Caribbean delegate underlined, "I'm disappointed in what is being sold as 'concessions'", and an LDC African country, referring to the date of 2010 given by the US regarding the elimination of export subsidies, wondered why we should be content with five more years of export subsidization. "We should ask for the immediate removal of export subsidies", he said with indignation, referring to the farmers at home that have lost their livelihoods as a result these supports.

"Blame game" follows failure of FIPs Ministers' meeting

21 October 2005

The WTO preparations for the Hong Kong Ministerial conference suffered a serious setback Wednesday night when a key meeting on agriculture involving Ministers of five major countries - the US, EU, Brazil, India and Australia - ended abruptly after failing to make any progress. The session scheduled for Thursday was cancelled.

On Thursday, a "blame game" took place, with some of the so-called "five interested parties" (FIPs) having press conferences and statements in which they disclaimed responsibility for the failure, and sought to place the blame elsewhere.

"It may not have been a collapse, but it was close to a collapse," said one developing country diplomat, describing what happened at the Wednesday talks.

The meeting had been attended by the US Trade Representative Robert Portman, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Indian Commerce and Industry Minister Kamal Nath and Australian Trade Minister Mark Valle.

A significant development Thursday was the decidedly downbeat assessment by both Portman and Mandelson on where the Doha talks now stand, following the failure of the FIPs meeting. ...

According to trade delegates, the Wednesday FIPs meeting floundered mainly because of the inability of the EU to make any new offers in the market access pillar of agriculture. The offer made by Mandelson the previous week on how far the EU could go to cut its tariffs had been rejected by the others as too weak. ...

Earlier, at a Wednesday afternoon press briefing, before the FIPs meeting, Amorim had been asked to respond to reports that Mandelson had said that the EU could not move in agriculture unless other countries make more concessions in other areas such as NAMA and services.

Amorim said he could understand that everything is conditional on what happens in other areas. "But we would be wary of any attempt to make a smokescreen to prevent an advance on agriculture."

He said Brazil would not refuse to discuss other issues, but the real negotiations in these other areas can take place "when we have a real shape in agriculture." He added: "It would not be possible to move in these other areas even to test flexibility in these areas, if we don't have clear signals in agriculture."

An Indian Commerce Ministry press release on 20 October described the world trade talks as being "deadlocked" over agriculture, after the key ministerial meeting. ...

Meanwhile, at another press briefing later Thursday, the Foreign Minister of Brazil, Celso Amorim, said in reference to the enlarged FIPs meeting taking place Thursday, that "we are at a crucial moment."

Speaking only on behalf of Brazil, Amorim said that while the round is a single-undertaking, its engine remains agriculture and the starter at this moment remains market access in agriculture.

He said that while the US proposal on domestic support is an important step, it was an insufficient one.

What is needed now in the round is an important move on market access that will help others to move, and also help the US to move on domestic support.

Other aspects also have to be discussed taking into account that this is a development round. The round is not a machinery to extract concessions from the developing countries, he said.

Referring to some remarks that had been made that there was now a deadlock, Amorim said that he preferred to speak of a 'padlock.' "And the key to the padlock is in the hands of the EU."

HD 	Homosexuality: Church in Africa Not United

Nairobi, Jan 30, 2005 (The Nation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --

The Anglican Church in Africa is hoping to "move forward" from the controversies and arguments of the recent past concerning homosexuality in the church.

TD 
	

Archbishop Peter Akinola of Nigeria told the press on Friday that the Anglican Church's purpose in the world was to glorify God and proclaim His word. He tried to brush aside questions from reporters on the one issue that has threatened to split the Anglican communion right down the middle.

The head of the Anglican Church of Nigeria, Archbishop Peter Akinola, addresses the press in Nairobi yesterday. Photo by Joan Pereruan.

However, the position taken by 16 primates from Africa, South East Asia and Latin America who met in Nairobi to discuss the issue of homosexual clergy amongst other matters, does not seem to be unanimous.

Asked whether all the African primates were united on this front, Archbishop Akinola admitted that the South Africans could not be said to be fully on board. There were no representatives from South Africa at the just-ended Nairobi conference.

South Africa's Archbishop Njongokulu Ndungane, the only publicly pro-gay voice in Africa, skipped the week-long Nairobi conference, a move which seemed to annoy the Nigerian who addressed journalists at the end of the meeting.

Some African church leaders, including Archbishop Ndungane and Nobel Peace prize winner, retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have questioned why the Anglican church is spending so much time on the issue of homosexuality, when there are pressing issues such as war, Aids and poverty to be addressed on the continent.

But annoyed at the prolonged questioning on this one issue, Archbishop Akinola, who has led the fight against acceptance of gays in the church and the ordination of gay clergy, said: "I didn't create poverty. This church didn't create poverty. Poverty is not an issue, human suffering is not an issue at all, they were there before the creation of mankind."

Archbishop Akinola and a host of other Anglican leaders from Africa, South East Asia and Latin America, also known as the Global South, had been in Nairobi since Monday at a meeting organised and hosted by the Kenyan chapter of CAPA, the Council of Anglican Provinces of Africa.

The meeting's agenda was ostensibly to prepare what the Nigerian primate referred to as the 3rd South-South Encounter of the Global South Provinces of the Anglican Communion to be held in October this year at Ein El-Sukhna in Egypt.

However, the Archbishop conceded that the forthcoming meeting of Anglican bishops to be held in Ireland in two weeks to discuss the Windsor Report, and last year's report from the Lambeth Commission on Communion (also known as the Eames Commission) had been discussed.

The main agenda of the Windsor Report was to chart the way forward for the Anglican Communion that was on the verge of fracturing after the controversial consecration of the openly homosexual Bishop Gene Robinson of New Hampshire in Canada.

African church leaders have been among the most vocal in criticising the consecration of a gay bishop. Some have even broken ties with individual American and Canadian churches.

Part of the agenda of the Nairobi meeting was for members of the Global South to come up with a common agenda for the primates' meeting in Ireland to be held in a fortnight from now to discuss the Windsor report.

However, yesterday, Archbishop Akinola said he would not want to "pre-empt or pre-judge" what the result of the crucial meeting would be.

Dr John Chew, Bishop of Singapore and President of the National Council of Churches of Singapore, who was also at the media briefing, categorically said that a split in the Anglican Communion was "not on the agenda".

Rejecting an apology made last week by the American Episcopal Church over the ordination of a homosexual bishop and the blessing of gay relationships, the clerics, representing over 70 million adherents, asked their American counterparts to repent instead.

"They have only apologised and not repented," said Archbishop Bernard Malango of Zambia.

"Apology does not make sense to us, the biblical word is repentance," said Kenya's Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi.

The Episcopalians met last week in Salt Lake City and issued an apology to the Anglican Churches "for the hurt" caused by the ordination of Bishop Robinson.

The 2.3 million-member Episcopal Church is the US branch of Anglicanism.

The Windsor Report was seen as an important moment in the life of the worldwide Anglican communion. It attempted to steer a middle road in the whole affair and so only gently admonished both sides in the gay clergy debate.

Some opponents accused the writers of the document of taking a somewhat paternalistic tone that in the words of one commentator "seems more suitable for scolding errant children than addressing the Church."

One of the suggestions in the report reads: "The Episcopal Church (USA) be invited to effect a moratorium on the election and consent to the consecration of any candidate to the episcopate who is living in a same gender union until some new consensus in the Anglican communion emerges."

In his reaction immediately after the report was released in October last year, Dr Akinola said: "I welcome the sincerity and hard work of those who have prepared the Windsor Report.

HD 	EU Blackmails African Negotiators

Cardiff, Wales, Nov 17, 2003 (Public Agenda/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --

European Union trade negotiators in Geneva are piling pressure on African governments the (Group of 90) to backdown from their demands that the US and EU remove subsidies on cotton before further trade negotiations would resume.

TD 
	

The cotton issue raised by four West African countries is believed to have triggered the collapse of the talks in Cancun in September. Reports gathered from Geneva indicate that EU negotiators are putting pressure on Nigeria in particular to soften its position on the cotton issue.

Nigeria and South Africa are leading the African offensive against unfair trade practices. But the EU believes if they are able to persuade Nigeria to shut up, countries like Ghana, which is the 'whipping boy' of the IMF and World Bank could easily be cowed into submission.

The pressure on Nigeria comes at the time the EU and the United States are desperate to get back to the negotiating table after a shocking walk out of the Group 90 last September.

Cotton is a milk and bread issue for many of Africa's cotton farmers who have been severely affected by US subsidies. 'It is therefore a legitimate right for African countries to continue pressing for US and EU subsidies to be removed, demanding compensation', argues Focus on the Global South a pressure group based in Geneva .

It is very easy to understand why the US, EU and their allies want the talks resumed immediately. Their egos have been bruised by trade ministers of least developed countries telling them to 'get off their backs.'

The EU needs to get to negotiations immediately because least developed countries, especially those in Africa import virtually everything from the EU. Some EU economies could suffer trade deficits if these poor countries start slapping retaliatory tariffs on EU goods.

Focus on the Global South argues that the US' proposal, that countries should borrow from the World Bank and the IMF in order to help them diversify from cotton is a slap in the face of farmers of West African. Global south charges the African Union to continue to insist on changing the structural trade imbalances perpetuated by the US, which is in direct contradiction to the spirit of the WTO.

Pressures are also being exerted at the capital level and on Ministers. 'The spin by the major powers is that developing countries will now have to climb down from mere posturing, and put a reasonable offer on the table.'

Pascal Lamy is still in a sulk. There is pressure mounting on him from powerful European business lobbyists to get the least developed countries back to the table. There are strong indications that the lobbyist could call for Lamy's head if he fails to clinch a deal soon.

For example, Lamy has been quoted at a meeting in Washington DC as saying that the EU and the US "will be waiting for a number of positive signals coming from other parts of the trade community," such as the G-20 and the G-90 (African, the African-Caribbean-Pacific countries and the LDCs).

With their hands tied to their backs, the EU and US could only resort to the 'blame game' to blackmail African countries to return to the table. Already, the 'blame game' seems to have slightly shifted the resolve of some developing countries.

In some quarters, there seems to be willingness to use the draft text (Derbez text) produced in Cancun as the basis of negotiations at least for agriculture. These Members (mostly African) argue that it is difficult for them to refuse, because of fingers pointing at them; and that this is a gesture to illustrate their readiness to sit at the table, not necessarily to accept what is in the text.

What the LDCs have forgotten is that the Derbez text largely reflects the interests of the EU and US. In agriculture for instance, the paper is very close to the US/EU position paper that was tabled in August 2003. The text does not reflect concerns OF LDCs promised to them in the Doha Declaration.

Trade watchdogs fear that using this text as a basis of negotiations would severely tilt the negotiating agenda in favour of the developed countries. It would make it more difficult for developing countries to remove certain undesirable items from the text, or making any major changes to it. This is possible, but requires tremendous political capacity, not merely negotiating capacity.

The major powers are also using the collapse of the multilateral trading system as a threat. Developed countries are also threatening the developing world that should they not cooperate in the multilateral trading system, bilateral agreements would be used as a basis for future negotiations.

The reality though, is that bilateral agreements are already proliferating. Besides, the 'multilateral' system, in the form of the WTO as it currently stands, has not reflected true multilateralism or cooperation.

The WTO instead has been used by the developed countries as an instrument to pry open markets, whilst the major countries themselves have liberalised or protected themselves according to what is in their best interest.

Currently, both the multilateral and bilateral foras are used in a complimentary manner to achieve the same goals of market opening and de-regulation. One forum also works to strengthen the other.

This is not the first time the West led by America are using bilateral agreement to cow poor countries into submission. When the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) was debated in the 70s US and Britain boycotted the talks, insisting on their rights to engage individual countries in negotiating communication deals. History is being replayed.

The reality is that the major powers will not allow the multilateral system to collapse. This is merely a threat. The European Union needs the WTO to open up markets. The US has more capacity to do that bilaterally, but would require the WTO to help them keep the Europeans in check. Is the WTO therefore outliving its usefulness in the face of threats to resort to bilateral trade negotiations? The signals point to that.

Within a space of 30 days (October 1-31, 2003), the number of mini trading alliances that have emerged out of the stalled Cancun talks point to the danger of bilateral trade negotiations replacing multilateral negotiations. First, it was Japan and China, two of Asia's biggest economies forming a framework of trade agreement with the Association of South East Asian Countries (ASEAN).

India also signed three free trade agreements with Singapore and Thailand, which are both ASEAN members. Following this is a similar agreement among China, Japan and India to create a broad East Asian group. In the same October, there was an agreement among Japan, China and South Korea to build a big trading block on the lines of European Union and the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA). The trade ministers of the three countries said they wanted to reduce their dependence on the United States market and also cooperate on security issues.

On October 20 the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) involving the United States, China, Russia, Peru, Mexico and other Latin American countries agreed that the Cancun draft text should be used as the basis for future negotiations. Then came the China EU talks on future trade cooperation. China in particular is glad that in future the EU could be autonomous of the US, following the independent positions France and Germany took on the war in Iraq.

Some analysts think the involvement of China in discussions over APEC and EU future cooperation is a setback to the position the Group of 90 and 20 took on the introduction of the new issues on the Cancun talks. The group of 21 led by China, Brazil, India, South Africa and Nigeria was very instrumental in the breakdown of the Cancun talks.

Trade experts fear these alliances, coming just one month after the failed talks at Cancan, point to the fact that the WTO will sooner or later become a secondary player. The sad outcome though, is that the EU and NAFTA are covertly working to break up the group of 90 and 21. At worse, the least developed countries will no longer find a common ground to walk out of future talks since their colleagues like China, Peru, Mexico etc. have agreed to the clandestine move to use the Cancun draft text as a basis for future negotiations.

This agreement among the APEC countries to get the talks going, irrespective of the disagreements has been interpreted as a diplomat victory for the United States. Using this as a trump card the US is expected to blame the least developed countries (mostly from Africa) for holding up the talks. Can the least countries stick to their ground?

Most accounts from Geneva-based negotiators indicate that the talks in Cancun collapsed as a result of US' refusal to move on agriculture, and more specifically on the politically sensitive cotton issue.

Whilst the G-90 (Africa Group, LDCs, ACP) did refuse to negotiate the new issues against the wishes of Japan and South Korea who favoured the new issues, it was a game plan by the developed countries to cover-up for US' refusal to implement the agricultural trade liberalisation policy it promised before the 2004 elections in order not to upset their powerful and influential agricultural lobbies.

However, the conclusion of Cancun was cleverly orchestrated to make it seem as though developing countries were being unreasonable - even refusing to accept Lamy's proposal to drop two or three of the Singapore issues.

The new issues of investment, competition, transparency in government procurement and trade facilitation will only serve the interests of the developed world's corporations at the expense of domestic enterprises, and should therefore be dropped from the already overloaded agenda.

HD 	Akinola Attacks Ndungane Over Gay Remarks.

Nairobi, Sep 23, 2003 (African Church Information Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) - The Archbishop of The Church of Nigeria, Most Rev Peter J. Akinola, has written a strong-worded letter to his southern Africa counterpart, Archbishop Winston Njongonkulu Ndungane of Cape Town, South Africa, expressing deep criticism over the stand taken by Ndungane on the controversial issue of gay ordination within the Anglican Church.

Responding to Ndungane's recent sentiments published in a leading British newspaper, Akinola has launched a scathing attack on his fellow churchman, telling him, "you got it all wrong".

TD 
	

Ndungane had indicated in an interview that African clergymen, including Akinola, who were expressing opposition to gay ordination were arrogant, intolerant and hypocritical.

Below is the full text of Archbishop Akinola's letter to Ndungane, released yesterday:

A MESSAGE TO ARCHBISHOP NDUNGANE

"My attention has just been drawn to a publication by a religious affairs correspondent in a British daily criticising the stand of a majority of Global South Primates and several other bishops around the world over the current departures arising from the ongoing controversies surrounding unscriptural revisionist innovations on human sexuality.

Your criticism is based on some unfortunate presuppositions. And coming at this time, it appears like an attempt to cause a possible diversion of focus amongst African and Global South Church leaders. But thank God these leaders have come of age, they are no longer to be pulled by the nose nor taken for granted. We are poised, using every gift of God available to us to defend orthodoxy, the integirity of the Church, and banish the erroneous teachings you plan to impose on us.

The criticism

1. How correct are you dear brother archbishop Ndungane in judging the cloud of witnesses to biblical truth through the ages whose stand on biblical ethics is only being upheld by those of us who are now branded as arrogant and intolerant? Is there anything in our pronouncements that constitutes a departure from the standard of morality held out in the Bible?

Isn't it a paradox that the Archbishop of Southern Africa sees no arrogance in those whose flagrant disregard of the stand of the entire Anglican Communion has plunged us into this sad and avoidable controversy. They have refused to ensure strict compliance with resolutions duly passed at the Bishops' Lambeth Conference and the Primates' Meetings. To you that is alright. Should there not be a protest against such disrespect? When has the poor (as we in the Global South are often called) begun to be proud over and against the rich (the affluent West)?

2. How can you forget so soon the alert we sounded at the Anglican Consultative Council (ACC) in Hong Kong barely a year ago? It is worth repeating here:

"While I appreciate that the New Westminster diocese and the Church of Canada may not be, in numerical terms, especially large ecclesia bodies, we value them as dearly as we value all our partner Provinces. We have a growing fear for the sense of loss which sustained departure by them from our common path and mind must risk. We urge and pray that reflection will lead to reconsideration. It is hard indeed to see any action, which threatens our Communion to be justified as a 'local mission priority'"

3. Brother Ndungane, you got it all wrong. What you cited as top priorities are in this context clearly misplaced. I ask, are the issues of peace, hunger, sharia, and HIV/AIDS, serious and prevalent, as they are, more important to the Church than faithfulness to the plain truth of Scripture? We remind you dear brother of our Lord's response to a similar situation two thousand years ago as recorded in Luke 13:1-5.(Please take time to read it over and over again). His response was that, tragic as those situations were, the more important priority was repentance. He actually said, "Unless you repent, you too will all perish" It didn't mean that Christ was not compassionate. If anything He demonstrated compassion daily in His miracles and teachings. We are following His footsteps by doing all we can for those caught in these painful conditions as part of our holistic approach to ministry.

We place a high priority on caring. For sure, the Archbishop has not forgotten that 'man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from God' (Dt. 8:3; Matt. 4:4; Lk. 4:4). Peace, hunger, sharia and HIV/AIDS are indeed major life and death issues, albeit, they are at the physical level. Unfaithfulness to Scripture is a more major life and death issue because it is spiritual. What shall it profit a man to feed well and live long here on earth only to lose his soul in hell? What then is the Church here for ?

4. On the question of integrity of ECUSA's decision, again we ask, can one eat his cake and still have it in his hands? And can two walk together unless they be agreed? (Amos 3:3). If the integrity of a part is so important, what will be said of the whole? And it must be said that this is not a matter of 'unity in diversity' for according to the rule: in the essentials, unity; in the non-essentials, freedom; in all things charity, the issue at stake falls within the orbit of the essentials and thus any deviation means alienation.

One suspects in your unguarded and scathing criticism a resurgence of a hitherto latent feeling of hurt since the Lambeth Conference Committee on human sexuality you chaired was overwhelmingly overruled by the so-called hard-liners who are not willing to compromise the precious heritage of scriptural truth.

5. The accusation of hypocrisy does not recognise the inherent difference between what the Church openly and officially sanctions and what it does not but exists. In the former, the Church stands responsible while in the latter, the burden of blame and guilt remains the private responsibility of those concerned with the accompanying room for repentance and forgiveness. This accusation carries with it an uncomfortable insinuation of double standards on the part of those opposed to homosexuality in the Church. However, it still does not square up as two wrongs do not add up to a right.

6. The unwarranted accusation that Africans do not know much about their sexuality portends a talking-down of Africans-a gnostic tendency that is capable of weakening the resolve of the African church leaders to be God's prophets in times like this. The biblical prophets resisted it and so must their contemporary counterparts.

I ask you dear brother to face issues and not fall into the temptation of "casting stones". Apparently you do not know everything I have said and done on every issue concerning Nigeria. That you have not heard any fuss from me in the foreign media about certain issues does not mean the Church which by the grace of God I lead is doing nothing. For instance, I deliberately included Zamfara State in the itinerary of the immediate past Archbishop of Canterbury to Nigeria and called the world's attention to the infringement on fundamental human rights that the imposition of the Islamic penal code portended for freedom-loving peoples. The Church in Nigeria has borne the most brunt of this unwarranted imposition. If you care to know, I urge you to refer to the volumes of published findings by Christian Solidarity Worldwide following their repeated visits to Nigeria, including my Office.

Conclusion

May I say as I conclude that your comments reveal a palpable failure to grasp the nature of the issues at stake. Your criticism is so burdened with such sad and most unfortunate presuppositions that see our stand from the point of arrogance and intolerance rather than a strong will to defend the 'faith that was once delivered to the saints.' When you accuse us of arrogance and intolerance, be courageous enough to direct the searchlight at yourself and those for whom you spoke.

What is at stake has to do not just with the identity of the Church universal and our historic faith but also how we treat God and his incarnate and written Word. Yes, we are a worldwide communion, but our church is only a part of the holy, catholic and apostolic Church. Where the autonomy of any part of our communion becomes a scandal in the entire Christian world, then we must be humble enough to accept rebuke and correction. There is still room for repentance. Amen."

The Most Rev Peter J Akinola Archbishop, Metropolitan and Primate The Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion.

Mar 21, 2003 (Addis Tribune/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) - As the U.S. began to attack Iraq yesterday, the arguments for and against war are becoming increasingly more sophisticated. The American and European media and the public seem to be engaged in the most fundamental questions of war and peace. However, in this domestic and international battle between doves and hawks, there seems to be a dearth of voices from the Global South - the developing countries of the world. These countries make up more than 4 billion of the 6 billion people on earth, yet we know little of the debates going on in these societies. To answer the question "what does the world think?" one must be concerned with these countries.

There is an intriguing paradox in the developing world. As an Ethiopian, I draw many of my conclusions from my experiences in my country and the writings of Westerners like Bernard Kouchner (Doctors without Borders) and Thomas Friedman (New York Times). The voices of the Global South are looking upon this crescendo of war with both fear and hope. While there is a great diversity of views in the developing world, there are, in my opinion, two distinct and contradictory views toward the war in Iraq. On the one hand, there is a very real opposition to and fear of unbridled American power. However, there is an equally strong opinion that wishes the US would take out Saddam and all the other autocratic and repressive regimes of the world.

The majority of the world's developing countries, it is sad to say, live under repressive governments. Many of us see the drive for democracy and the overthrow of authoritarianism in Iraq as a potential boon for justice in our societies.

These two seemingly contradictory views (fear and hope) are fueled by the equally paradoxical strategy that the American government has adopted in its war against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The Bush administration has crafted a truly "grand strategy" of international affairs not seen since the end of WWII. It is an international strategy that seeks to make the post-cold war era one permanently dominated by the US. This so-called "Bush plan" believes in preventive war. It believes in American power. It believes in a greatly expanded notion of American national security.

These ideas of American dominance scare the hell out of much of the world. Yet, the people behind this doctrine of American power (from Paul Wolfowitz the Deputy Defense Secreteary to Scooter Libby Deputy to Vice President Cheney) are also crafting a strategy that defines the post-Cold War era as one of democratic proliferation. They see the creation of a democracy in the heart of the Middle East as an example for the region and the world. They believe that democracy will have peace dividends in the long run and will maintain a stable international order.

The first dimension of the Bush strategy horrifies the world - especially developing country nationals who lived under the US or Soviet thumb during the cold war. The second dimension hankers after the secret hopes of those who live under the many authoritarian regimes of the Global South.

I am from Ethiopia and I was lucky enough to get out of my country and get my education in the US, at Georgetown University. While the political conditions in my country may not compare to those in Syria, Burma, or Liberia, it is nonetheless a country where dissent is brutally crushed and the party line is the only line.

I know, from experience, that many people in counties like Ethiopia are suspicious and/or frightened of American power. One only has to remember the overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz in Chile, the assassination of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, or the American support of UNITA terrorists in Angola. In the eyes of the developing countries of the world, the overwhelming asymmetry of power in the international system is frightening because they believe that US power will degenerate into US thug-ism. Yet, there is also a hidden yearning in these very societies for a US foreign policy that will "push" or "pull" countries toward more accountable and transparent government. Many are hoping that American values will percolate into the international system and into their own countries.

There are many aspects to Bush's "grand American strategy." Some of them are deeply disturbing and some of them are long overdue. These ideas have been reiterated in the Defense Planning Guidance written by Paul Wolfowtiz in 1991 and the 1997 "Statement of Principles" signed by the likes of Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney. Today, the Bush administration believes that:

- the US should create an international system that prevents the rise of other powers that can challenge the US;

- the US should deal "preventively" with the problem of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and rogue states;

- the US has an interest in the stabilization of regional conflicts;

- the US should tackle non-traditional security threats like HIV/AIDS;

- the US should actively spread democracy throughout the Middle East and the world.

To people in Ethiopia (and elsewhere) who live under a regime based on ethnic power and the repression of dissent, this last idea of democratic proliferation is very appealing.

In Ethiopia in April 2001, students who were protesting for their right to academic freedom were jailed, tortured and killed in protests that wracked the capital. Today, those campaigning for a more liberal and democratic Ethiopian state are targeted and silenced. These kinds of government actions are common throughout the developing world.

In countries like Ethiopia, the internal challenge to the government is not sufficient to effect change. Pressures must also come from outside the state. It is international interventions that brought about change in odious regimes like Apartheid South Africa.

This does not mean that the US should go around invading countries left and right. The entire gamut of foreign policy tools, from quite diplomacy, to naming-and-shaming, to World Bank loan pressure, to credible threats of force can be used. Such efforts will help the many voices for democracy and change in the developing world that find themselves speaking truth to power. Unfortunately, in these countries, it is usually power that wins the day. What will happen when real power - American power - is wedded to legitimate causes?

There are obviously real risks to such a "grand strategy." Not the least of which is imperial overstretch and the abuse of power. If other countries cannot balance US power and if international institutions are rendered impotent (the Security Council, the International Criminal Court, and international treaties like Kyoto), the potential for American thug-ism is much greater.

However, the opportunity to restructure the very basis of the international system, in my opinion, is too great to let pass. The international environment after 9/11 is similar to that after WWII, when the US helped rebuild Europe and Japan and created a new international financial and legal system. Such an opportunity has presented itself again and Iraq will be the test case.

If the US intervention in Iraq is done correctly, we will no longer be living in the "post-cold war world" but in a "new democratic era," a world where democracy is the norm rather than the exception, a world where people like me can live safely in their own countries.
